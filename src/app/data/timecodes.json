takes care of it, and I explain that in the recipe book\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Detox \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe day that I left for Nevada city, California\n\n I started getting a detox in this bursa, and I had bursitis as you know, it was mainly in the feet and legs, sometimes in the elbows and wrist.\n\n It was the first time I got it here and it was so painful that by the time I drove all the way up to Sacramento.\n\n \r\nThat night I had to put the arm in the sling, it was so painful.\n\n So, after a few days of this, I would have to sleep in the bathtub.\n\n It was so painful because I couldn't lie.\n\n It could be in any position.\n\n The only place it was comfortable was in a sling like this.\n\n If I lie down, the pain was excruciating, no matter which way.\n\n \r\nSo, I had to sleep in the bathtub at night.\n\n So, I slept six to eight hours a night in the bathtub, and there it was okay.\n\n For the rest of the day, I'm still in severe pain, but I went ahead with my eight hours of workshops and my 10 hours a day of seeing patients through that whole thing.\n\n  \r\nBut on the third day, all of a sudden, I smelled with this penicillin coming out of my armpit and then the mercury coming out of my hand.\n\n All of a sudden, my hand one morning turned black and gray from here down and it smelled just like mercury.\n\n  \r\nSo, I knew right away what it was.\n\n When I was 12 years old and had the peritonitis that they misdiagnose as appendicitis.\n\n They injected me in this arm, this arm, and these two hips.\n\n Now I've gone through the detox on these two hips in this arm, but never this arm.\n\n \r\nI had 11 shots in this arm in three days.\n\n They were injecting me with penicillin and other antibiotics and tetanus.\n\n They always give you tetanus if you have appendicitis.\n\n They knew I didn't have appendicitis, but they gave me tetanus anyway and repeated tetanus.\n\n You're only supposed to get one, every six months max.\n\n \r\nSo, they shot me up with all this mercury liquid mercury, thimerosal from these injections.\n\n So, then I realized what it was.\n\n That the antibiotics that they injected in me at 12 years old was finally discharging and it buried himself in the bursa.\n\n So, my hand was black and my arm smelled like penicillin and other molds.\n\n \r\nI couldn't lift my arm this high for about three weeks, and then I went down to Costa Rica, and it was finally better because humidity is better for that kind of thing.\n\n Get moisture in your body.\n\n Can utilize the nutrients better than building all the mucus just for the dryness.\n\n \r\nSo, all of a sudden, two days ago, where I was injected all those times.\n\n There it is.\n\n  \r\nAll of a sudden popped up two days ago and you can see that five of the holes, six of the holes where they stabbed me and scabs.\n\n \r\nYeah, after so many years.\n\n Like I said, it takes 40 years to get health optimal.\n\n  \r\nYou smell mercury.\n\n Did you ever play with mercury.\n\n It a heavy metal that almost makes your mouth turn alimony?\n\n Have you ever had an unripe banana.\n\n That's an alimony taste?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Letting His Teeth Rot \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanted to see what would happen on this diet if you just let the teeth go\n\n I'm still doing it.\n\n Like, I have a tooth here, which is almost completely rotten down and the nerves right there.\n\n I mean, I can poke it and it'll bleed, but I have no pain and I used to have severe pain.\n\n\r\nI mean, pain so bad.\n\n Like it would last 30, 60 days and I'd have to magic mushrooms and a marijuana mixture as my painkiller to get rid of it and then do nothing but eat, sleep all day.\n\n That's all I could do cause the pain was so excruciating, and that's when I began eating that was shortly after the poison mushroom and I destroyed my body so much and it was in December of 1982 when I had that severe toothache that I began eating meat every day and that made a big shift in my pain level.\n\n \r\nAll of a sudden when I started doing that within 30, 40 days, I barely experienced any tooth pain anymore, and now I experience none.\n\n The nerves are right there.\n\n I can puncture them and they'll bleed, but yet I'm eating and I get no pain food going down there and hitting it all the time.\n\n\r\nMaybe once in a while if I make a nut formula and a little chunk is there and it gets back there, but it isn't severe, and the pain doesn't last more than a second, two seconds.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Algae Blue Green \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, first of all\n\n Algae is only edible digestible as long as it's still in the water and acted in the water.\n\n Once it's dried, you will absorb less than probably 20% of it and not well.\n\n Cause again, it's a vegetable that's dehydrated.\n\n \r\nIf you take the algae, filter it and then drink it right out of the water, it'll be active and good for you.\n\n Still, you're not going to digest a lot of it because you're not a fish.\n\n Takes a fish system to break down that particular type of cellulose.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's no cellulose in blue green algae.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yes there is.\n\n \r\nIf you do an experiment.\n\n Take your spirulina.\n\n\r\nMeasure, how much you take and then check your feces for 48 hours and measure how much passes through you without digestion.\n\n When I did it, 98% passed through.\n\n \r\nThe best for one particular animal was 20% absorption, and that's all.\n\n So again, to me, it's another hype food thing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bee Pollen & Pain Formula \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBee pollen is a nut, it's a seed\n\n It even has a shell on it.\n\n Once that shell is dried, a human cannot digest it.\n\n Pass through you.\n\n So, anytime you see B pollen that's a hard little pellet.\n\n You may as well throw your money away if you're gonna buy it because it's of no value.\n\n You digest less than 2% of it.\n\n You need fresh, soft, and your digestive juices will actually dissolve the shell away, and it's a very finite protein.\n\n \r\nThat's why I like to use it in the pain formula because the molecules of fat are so fine and so small that they get into the nerve endings, and once the protein gets there, all the extra swelling can leave That's how the pain formula works.\n\n You've got all the minerals from the cheese that will help draw out the toxic minerals.\n\n\r\nNow, remember anytime a mineral is not bioactive like in cheese, what the body's gonna do with those minerals is attach them to other toxic minerals in the blood.\n\n That means that all the bioactive minerals are in your juice, meat, and dairy, other than dried cheese will be utilized to be absorbed into the cells.\n\n\r\nSo, you don't have to waste those bioactive minerals binding with those toxic minerals that are in the body, use cheese for that.\n\n That's how I came up with the pain formula.\n\n pollen supplies the protein that can be absorbed into the finite capillaries and the nerve endings, so that the fluid can be removed and therefore reducing the pain.\n\n\r\nAll pain is swelling in the nerves, then the toxic minerals that may be floating will be drawn out with the cheese.\n\n Generally the egg and the butter helps chelate with other toxic substances that were buried in and locked in that particular area where the nerves were suffering or their nerves were experiencing.\n\n\r\nSo bee pollen is very important for nerves.\n\n It's great for nerves.\n\n If you have it with fruit, it's a waste.\n\n So, the time to have B pollen is always with meat, eggs and butter or in combination with eggs and butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much do you normally take.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I recommended people have the pain formula once a week, regardless, and they work from two to four tablespoons of bee pollen, but you can utilize more if you want?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) BPA Teeth \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFilled with porcelain inlay\n\n Plastic is highly toxic and the gums will recede.\n\n If you put facials or any kind of plastic in the tooth, the gum will rot and recede away from it.\n\n So, then you have an open area for capitation.\n\n If you use an inlay, there isn't that kind of gassing of BBA.\n\n \r\nAnd I understand why now he does that because they just came out with a report two months ago that showed that BPA, bisphenol acid.\n\n It causes 82% of the animals in the laboratory experiments to have developed brain cancer, 82% of them.\n\n So, the FDA is talking about outlawing BPA being used to solidify plastics, but we're already in it.\n\n \r\nIf you have synthetic rugs, if you have synthetic clothes, it's in all of it.\n\n So, you breathe it.\n\n If you have fibers, lint from your clothes and they're synthetic, you breathe them, that melts in your lungs, cuz your lungs have to dissolve it, and then what happens is you release dioxin, PDA and a number of other toxins.\n\n  \r\nIn the plastic fillings, which are called composites, you have that BPA at a very high amount cause they wanna make those so hard and strong, and what happens is if you have ever had a facial put on, which means the cavity has the gum line on the face of the tooth, your gum will recede from it quickly, and it'll causes recessive gum.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Calckum COntent Of Water \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCalcium in water will just magnetize toxic calcium out like cheese does\n\n But it'll also take a lot of the things out.\n\n If you're exercising, it's fine.\n\n Like I said, I don't like when  people drink water, unless they exercise.\n\n Some people if they've been on the diet a long time, and they're not exercising, they don't need water.\n\n\r\nDrink milk eat tomatoes, the more vegetable juice.\n\n\r\nBut no matter what kind of minerals it's concentrated in, they'll all turn out white once the water's evaporated.\n\n Doesn't matter what kind of minerals it is.\n\n\r\nBecause it's basically distilled water, and it's very hungry water.\n\n Rain waters is distilled water.\n\n And when that hits the ground, it starts dissolving the earth.\n\n That's how plant eat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Chickens Need Meat & Soy \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey give them some supplemental nutrients because the protein, we're trying to get away from that because chickens naturally eat meat\n\n Chickens and ducks eat lots of meat.\n\n That's why they'll eat each other if they don't get enough protein.\n\n So, the industry, the FDA said, okay, we wanna stop you from feeding these animal byproducts, and we want you to only use grains.\n\n Soy bean grows and grows and grows, but chickens cannot eat soybeans without processing, just like humans.\n\n If a chicken eats raw soybeans, it will kill them.\n\n It can kill a human.\n\n So they have to be solvent extracted.\n\n That's like soaking your food and kerosene for 20 minutes and eating it.\n\n\r\nSo, the soy is highly toxic for chicken and humans.\n\n So now, I've been trying to get people to feed waste, and a fresh raw waste animal products to their chickens, which is natural.\n\n They do it in Pangea and Hawaii.\n\n Let me tell you, they are the most sedentary, nice, friendly ducks I've ever met.\n\n\r\nMy grandparents had a farm and those ducks attack.\n\n They attack! Mean as a snake.\n\n Well, boy, when they get rotten meat, they will follow you anywhere and just rub up against you.\n\n They love you.\n\n Incredible.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Deficiencies On Raw Diet \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI just started getting white spots on my hands since maybe last month, and I've ready lack of calcium, lack of zinc\n\n\r\nWhat's your understanding of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, don't try to counterbalance like that?\n\n Those signs are just signs that you're detoxifying a concentration of something, and building into the nails, not something you should even worry about, unless it's painful.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you feel it's actually detoxing rather than.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnytime you're detoxing, you're going to have certain kinds of deficiencies.\n\n As long as you're constantly eating the balanced diet, you're always gonna supply the right balance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, why is there deficiencies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet's say you're detoxing mercury?\n\n\r\nThere's a certain balance of minerals that will attach to a mercury molecule to harness it, prevent it from doing damage in your system.\n\n That can cause a potassium, magnesium, zinc, and one other mineral that are very concentrated, be utilized to do that.\n\n Just to control it, to magnetize to it.\n\n\r\nSo, you start having a deficiency periodically, if you don't keep up your eating.\n\n If you're eating the primal diet balanced diet on a daily basis.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Diabetes & Honey \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnybody want an ice cream\n\n *Laughs*\r\nWell, it has to be unheated honey that hasn't been heated over 93°?\n\n Once it hits 93°, it destroys the insulin like substance that the bee has produced in its stomach when it swallows nectar.\n\n\r\nHoney, is bee vomit, exactly what it is.\n\n He swallows it, takes it back to the hive.\n\n After it's produced the insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digestion and utilizing protein, gets back to the hive and vomits.\n\n\r\n93°, that is destroyed.\n\n That's why the bees will fan the hive to keep it down to 92.\n\n8 degrees.\n\n Once the upper layer turns over that for more than about 40 minutes, they leave it and then goes to the next layer and makes sure that it doesn't get beyond that.\n\n \r\nThey will only eat those upper layers.\n\n They will never feed it to the drones or to the queen.\n\n But the worker bees will only eat that if they're starving.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes sugar feed tumors.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHoney does not do that if it is completely unheated?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Diarrhea & Vomit For Normal People Vs On Diet \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAll of a sudden that's going to make the difference between life and death\n\n It's absurd.\n\n It's insane, and the people who are not on this diet, the average people out there are having 18% to 20% diarrhea or vomit every day.\n\n On this diet the rate is only 12%, figure that one out.\n\n We have a lot more bacteria on this diet.\n\n \r\nSo, it isn't the bacteria that's causing the problem.\n\n It's the poisons.\n\n How many people have seen somebody eat something poisonous ended up a diarrhea and vomit.\n\n MSG in your food, pesticides, herbicides in your food.\n\n That's what's causing the problem.\n\n\r\nPoisons, pollution, chemicals.\n\n The medical profession and the food industry are in love together, and they produce this bacteria fear.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it advisable to eat shit if you don't have like a serious illness or cancer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSure?\n\n If you've not been raw fooder all of your life, your likelihood of collecting a lot of cells in your body and not reproducing them.\n\n\r\nThe greatest authority on cancer and at a conference in 2000, he said, \"Everybody stand up, men.\n\n I want you to look at the man next to you.\n\n One of the two of you will have cancer in your lifetime.\n\n And the women, three of you look at each other.\n\n One of three of you women will have cancer in your lifetime\".\n\n \r\nThat's how bad it is.\n\n So, eat shit and live.\n\n I really did think of writing a comedy routine and calling it, \"Eat Shit and Live\" because that's the only way you're gonna open minds to that concept before they come in the room.\n\n I thought about doing it with my next book on detoxification, but my publisher won't do it.\n\n\r\nI mean, it would be a catchy thing, who would buy that.\n\n Eat Shit and Live.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you say something anything about brain cells, brain tumors also have bacteria too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat was the test they're doing at the University of Toronto for 29 years now?\n\n \r\nTwo to seven days, including vessels going to tumor.\n\n**[person]**\n ate a lot of high meat and it didn't move those tumors.\n\n The breast tumor it did, but the kidney, the adrenal, and the hip bone; it didn't move it.\n\n The fecal matter did it quickly.\n\n\r\nHigh meat is in the recipe book.\n\n\r\nHigh meat means you just let meat oxidize til it gets full of bacteria in it and it stinks.\n\n**[Too hard to understand past this point]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Does Lymph Dump Toxins & Skin \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, the lymph system doesn't dump a lot into the blood, but you're eating\n\n You're not fasting.\n\n You're eating enough to deal with those toxins that get into the blood.\n\n Most of it will go through the skin.\n\n  \r\nSo, you get into a hot bath and perspire a little bit more or a sauna for a few minutes, don't cook yourself in the sauna.\n\n \r\nYou actually cook the vitamin D and vitamin a in your skin.\n\n Let's say nine minutes.\n\n If you're at a level of about 130°, if you're up on top 160°, you can count on getting rid of a lot of nerves with the cells as well if you're up there cooking.\n\n  \r\nSo, stay in the lower room if you're in there.\n\n No more than you 8, 9 minutes if you're at a level where it's 130 degrees.\n\n If you're in a hot bath, that's 105°, 106°, you can be in there an hour, two hours.\n\n When I'm in pain, like when I had my spien cauterized and I was in constant pain and I had to crawl on the floor, I lived in the bathtub.\n\n 16, 18 hours a day.\n\n \r\nI rewarmed the water every hour and half, two hours, and I lived in the bathtub.\n\n I was painless in the bathtub, relatively painless in the bathtub.\n\n I was able to discreet lot of poison.\n\n \r\nBut some of that fat is bound to the poison.\n\n Body tries to resolve it and push most of it out to the skin.\n\n The best thing you can do is take hot baths.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Eggs Healing Alone \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nEggs\n\n Talk about eggs in the detox process.\n\n You talked about the teeth and all that.\n\n Just talk about eggs in that process.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn the teeth process.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, just generally detoxing, and what would you recommend?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEggs don't detoxify, unless you eat them with fruit, then you make a solvent of that fat and protein?\n\n Eggs by themselves are always healing, reconstituting.\n\n They do not help you divide cells.\n\n So, they don't help cellular reproduction, but they can take a live cell and reconstitute it with all the nutrients in the egg.\n\n \r\nSo, it can make a very sick cell very healthy, but it won't help you reproduce cells.\n\n  \r\nSmoothies make you go through more detoxification, fruit along with the fat in eggs will make you detoxify, makes solvents.\n\n It makes viruses to dissolve toxic compounds in your body.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nNot eating eggs alone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n That helps constitute and feed your body.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, how often could you could you do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDepends how much you want to detox?\n\n I recommend only having fruit once in a day.\n\n If you want to have the smoothie with that.\n\n Other than that, you're taking a risk on coming down with a heavy detoxification.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Fat Deficiency Causing Irritability From Sun \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, all my life, I been very happy when outside\n\n \r\nMy moods are very, very good.\n\n In the sun I'm always extremely irritable.\n\n So, I'm wondering if.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's a severe fat deficiency where you're not able to transform the radiation to vitamin D.\n\n So, what it does is irritate the system instead of aids it.\n\n  \r\nAnd it takes a while, I was the same way as a child, I could get into sun.\n\n My hair was toe white when I was born and my skin was so white that if I got in the sun for 10 minutes, I would blister.\n\n \r\nAnd I would get very irritable, nasty.\n\n But you know, now that I've had all this fat for so long, I love the sun.\n\n If I was stuck in the desert I would start dehydrating along with the sun.\n\n I could still feel the heat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you're still advocating sun even though.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, like I said you need to get little amounts of it at a time.\n\n It may be a year or two before you're ready to take it.\n\n But do it a little at a time.\n\n 2 minutes at a time isn't going to make you crazy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's the thought that makes me crazy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* Then wait.\n\n Wait another 6 months, try it then.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Feet Expansion \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou foot expands\n\n Can it get wider.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it can?\n\n I've got a triple D here.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat were you before.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was a C?\n\n When I was a teenager, I was a C.\n\n Now I'm a triple D.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo.\n\n you're feet on the diet eventually will get wider.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends?\n\n I don't wear a lot of shoes.\n\n So, my foot is naturally allowed to spread and expand.\n\n\r\nIf I kept them in shoes like most people do that would prevent the expansion.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Fermented & Moldy Food BActeria Protects & Helps \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nRemember when your body makes a solvent to dissolve compounds, you've got a lot of excess waste\n\n I prefer people eating moldy foods and, high meats and stuff like that, so the bacteria reduce those compounds with smaller substance.\n\n That's a much better way to do it.\n\n It isn't as enjoyable.\n\n  \r\nLess detoxification and less painful.\n\n Almost nonexistent as far as inconvenience in the body, unless it causes a bacterial meningitis, then you're in for a detoxification, but that takes at least eight ounces of high fish.\n\n \r\nOnce you've had it several times, all of a sudden, your body starts liking it.\n\n \r\nLike in the Eskimos, they smell that.\n\n They just start getting excited, turn red, like really on, and they jump up their have a great time.\n\n They love that.\n\n They know how it's gonna make them high and happy right away, t gets them through the winter, have all that bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey're high.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, they are?\n\n It's their narcotic *Laughs*.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Fillings \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nComposites are not a good thing\n\n Porcelain, so called enamel fillings are the best thing.\n\n It's much more expensive.\n\n So, if you have the time and you can do it, you can go down to Mexico and have it done for a third the price.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about gold.\n\n \r\nSome people recommend gold, but then there's a tendency that it helps conduct radio frequencies?\n\n \r\nSo, there are some people who will have radio signals in their sleep and hear them and disturb their sleep.\n\n Some people, it just does it on a normal basis, it depends on how perceptive their ears are.\n\n  \r\nSo, there's also a, a doctor who calculated the amount of radiation that it attracts.\n\n Even gold.\n\n So, metals attract radiation and radio wave.\n\n Radio waves are radiation just below light level radiation.\n\n So, he doesn't recommend, and most people don't recommend metal for that reason.\n\n So, your porcelain is most like the tooth and it will cause less toxicity.\n\n  \r\nYou're always gonna have some toxicity because they have to have a epoxy to gear it to the tooth.\n\n If you have an inlay, they make it a little bit fatter than the tooth, so it snaps in.\n\n So, you have a very minor amount of epoxy.\n\n Now I met with this one dentist who is very naturally oriented.\n\n He believes that people should just leave their cavitations open like I do, but he hasn't seen what I've seen.\n\n  \r\nHe thinks just adding mineral supplements and a good diet will reverse all conditions and it's theoretical and I've seen that it isn't true.\n\n It doesn't happen that way.\n\n  \r\nLeaving the tooth available to the oxygen.\n\n The oxygen itself is going to oxidize the tubules.\n\n Tubules are like veins that come through the skin in the tooth and they feed like the lymph all the calcium and the nutrients out to the dentine, and keep the dentine layer safe.\n\n  \r\nWhen you have a cavitation and that oxygen is getting in there.\n\n It's like soft bone marrow and it will decay, not decay, will oxidize.\n\n  \r\nI've been back to dentist for the last 15 years, several times.\n\n I have absolutely no decay in my mouth, but I have all these rotten looking teeth, but that's oxidization so I'm not breeding bacteria to degenerate my teeth, but naturally oxidization happens.\n\n \r\nSo, I don't recommend people do that, I'm just experimenting with myself to see.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Fish Oil \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow about fish oil\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFish oil is a different thing?\n\n That's an animal fat.\n\n It's wonderful, but anytime you buy a fish oil that's been separated from the fish.\n\n You use a solvent to purify it and that's like soaking your fish oil in kerosene.\n\n\r\nThey have to use heat and/or a solvent to purify it.\n\n It's all purified and clarifed.\n\n That's a solvent process.\n\n Only way you are gonna get pure oils is from a fish.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Flax Oil \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are 2 different fields there\n\n Flax oil is 90% solvent reaction.\n\n That's why it's good antioxidant, it helps break down toxic substances.\n\n It does not lubricate the body.\n\n It does not aid the body and stabilize it.\n\n It is mainly a solvent that will dissolve and detoxify toxic substances in body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIsn't that good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's good, unless you're thin as you are, then you don't want to do it?\n\n You want to build and stabilize your system and get enough weight on that you can afford to do that because the byproducts from using a solvent light that will have a lot of waste products, and they'll just go into your tissues all over the place.\n\n\r\nIt has to get it into there without damaging the intestinal walls.\n\n It can't do that unless it is stable.\n\n The body's stable with good raw fats, animal fats.\n\n It has to be protected first.\n\n It's like you going in and taking care of nuclear waste without a suit on.\n\n It's not a good idea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that isn't that good to take.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n In fact, people who just come onto the diet, I say, stay away from all kinds of pressed oils for a couple of years if you're very thin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Flossing \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about flossing\n\n Is that a good idea?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow flossing is okay, definitely because plaque is down there where the brush can't get easily?\n\n It helps break it away.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Free Radicals & Heavy  Metals On Cooked Foods \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, in combination with the cauterized minerals in those cooked foods, because in grains, those minerals are very concentrated\n\n Very hard and very solid, lots of metal, metallic minerals in grains, especially if it's grown with chemicals.\n\n You put all those poisons in and you cook them, they become three radicals and the brain use most of the metals.\n\n Nervous system.\n\n \r\nSo, that's why people are very scattered, but civilizations have known that for a long time.\n\n They kept all the lackies in China, 90% of their diet was grain and in Egypt they did the same thing from the slaves.\n\n They would keep them emotionally imbalanced and physically hyperactive to do the work and the royalty, they lived almost entirely on fats and meat.\n\n Warriors were in between.\n\n \r\nGarbage.\n\n Yeah, that's such hype.\n\n I did that for a year and a half, macrobiotic diet.\n\n I witnessed that for so many years.\n\n I did not know one person who survived that I knew, that is wishful thinking.\n\n\r\nSalt and rice, that's what their diet is.\n\n Mainly high pressure steamed rice.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Gas \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nGas\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, gas?\n\n Usually what happens is you have poisons that are in the intestinal walls or stomach walls or esophageal walls, and it dumps in and mixes with the gastrointestinal juices and that causes gas.\n\n But most of that is reduced on this diet.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you go on the diet, for 95% of the people, 90% of the gas leaves them that they're normally used to having on a cooked diet.\n\n And then some people get a little bit more for a while, maybe 3 to 5 months and then that dissipates down to about 95% that they're normally used to passing, and that means you have 95% better friends.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Gas From Salads \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd then when I go up to these people, I've been having salads\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo wonder you have gas.\n\n\r\nJust remember if you eat salads, salads alkalinize the intestinal tract.\n\n The intestinal tract has to be acid to digest all the animal product.\n\n You're gonna have lots of gas.\n\n \r\nIf you eat a salad, it better be the last food of the day, so no meat catches up to it during the night because you will have gas.\n\n That's why I suggest vegetable juice, not vegetables.\n\n You need to alkalinize the blood, not the intestines.\n\n And if we were well, we wouldn't even need vegetable juice.\n\n We wouldn't need that mineral supplement, all the alkalinity, and all the vitamin and enzyme supplements.\n\n\r\nAll the other tribes that eat raw foods don't need that.\n\n They just eat the meat and dairy and the blood, simple.\n\n They don't ever eat vegetables.\n\n Well, I shouldn't say ever, once or twice a year.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Grains Cravings & Period Pain & Why Women Live Longer \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nA lot of times when people grew up on a lot of grains, you have all these sugar byproducts\n\n Now, Columbia University did a test and they found the byproducts store 70% to 90%.\n\n  \r\nIn a healthy body it stores for a lifetime at rate of 70%, in an unhealthy body at a rate of 90%.\n\n If you have not been a meat eater and eating good quality fats from meat, you will not have removed any of it in your lifetime.\n\n All of a sudden, when you start going on a diet like this, all of a sudden, the body's gonna get rid as much as it can from the nervous system quickly.\n\n \r\nAnd that causes swelling in the brain and nervous system, which can cause headaches.\n\n If that happens, you'd have to cut out all other vegetables and just mainly drink celery juice and eat tomatoes to get enough of the salts out the brain, and nervous system, so you reduce the swelling.\n\n So, you won't have as many problems.\n\n \r\nAnd as far as the female cyclical cycle being painful, the female organs do a lot to discharge poisons.\n\n The only thing that I can find that correlates with women living 20% longer is that the vaginal discharge is 20% greater than any man discharges of mucus is right to the equation that women live 20% longer.\n\n \r\nCause they have another area to discharge quickly, a lot of toxic matter.\n\n So, in the cycle is where a lot of women discharge a lot of poison.\n\n \r\nThings that are high in natural sodium, which will help helping us swelling.\n\n Also, pink grapefruit.\n\n So, if you were change your juices to only celery for the period of time that you're suffering and eat half of a pink grapefruit a day in the afternoon, and tomatoes any other time, then you will have enough sodium to pull the salts, toxic salts that cause the swelling out of the system.\n\n \r\nSo, you'll have less pain.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Heating Devices & Hot Water Bottles \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey have these heat applications where you stick it in the microwave\n\n\r\nCan you imagine how many metallic metals are all of a sudden going be irradiated.\n\n You're gonna put that there and it's gonna emit radiation through your skin, through your lymph system.\n\n\r\nNot very bright.\n\n So, get those hot water bottles.\n\n If you don't want a plastic one with BPA in it, out of England, they make these pure rubber water bottles, they stink like hell, they smell like rubber.\n\n It takes six months or so to get rid of the odor, but they won't cause the BPA to get into the skin.\n\n Um, Timber something, natural health food store.\n\n\r\nSell Natural clothing, camping products and stuff like that, \"Vermont Country Store\".\n\n\r\nLet me tell you, they don't break like the plastic ones.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou leave it in the sun six weeks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I do.\n\n\r\nI leave it out 6 months, 6 weeks minimum.\n\n Cause it's real rubber.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\n6 months or you can't use it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can use it?\n\n It's just I hate the smell of rubber.\n\n So, I have 4 or 5 of them and I leave them out for 6 months, and the one I used I already left out for 6 months.\n\n\r\nNo, it's better.\n\n Children have a lot of growth hormone, so they will heal.\n\n They heal quickly and if that garbage is left there, they will scar and they'll never develop properly.\n\n So, heat on the child all the time.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, just throw out the old plastic water bottles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I did?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) High Cholesterol & BloodSugar \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAgain, remember the honey has a natural insulin already in it from the bee, so it doesn't react that way\n\n I put juvenile diabetics on the unheated honey, and the sugar level goes way up in their blood, but it causes no symptoms.\n\n There are no symptoms.\n\n \r\nAnd the cholesterol levels and sugar levels are fine as long as they're not toxic substances.\n\n Having a high cholesterol level is the best thing you can have in our society to deal with poisons.\n\n A ton of poisons and you breathe them in every day.\n\n \r\nWell, you make sauces.\n\n All the sauces in the Recipe Book.\n\n Butter with everything.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Highly Toxic Occuptation & Airport \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOh, there was one other highly toxic person besides mechanics and load operators\n\n And those people grew up under an airport or landing strip.\n\n\r\nVery toxic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) How Many Years Aajonus Eats Raw Meat \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, when you were experimenting eating like that\n\n Tripe and parasites and stuff, how many years have you been eating the raw meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the chicken tripe came pretty pretty rapidly?\n\n This was 1979 when I ate that and I started eating the raw meat in September of 1976 when I ate the rabbit, and I was only eating meat maybe twice a week, average twice a week.\n\n \r\nBut I had just got off of a long fast, and I was starving, and I broke the 42-day fast.\n\n I don't recommend anybody does fasting, it took me 3 years to recover from that fast.\n\n If you're eating meat, it may not take as long.\n\n  \r\nSo, I had to break the fast in the middle of the night and there were no stores open.\n\n \r\nSo, I went into the garbage bin of the fish store and there was a huge filet of salmon with pinworms in it.\n\n So, I did it and I ate it.\n\n I just knew there was gonna be no problem.\n\n So, then after I did it, the next morning I was in a panic.\n\n So, I had my blood taken once a week for 10 weeks and had a feces check.\n\n \r\nNever had a parasite.\n\n So, I mean, this piece of salmon was undulating with these white- I thought these guys were so hardy and fibrous.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) How To Mineralize \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat meat meal, grate some cheese and put that in the mixture right before you eat it\n\n\r\nThere you'll provide a lot of minerals that that will attach to the lemon or citrus juice, whatever it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly, raw milk is the best substance to drink.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n As long you have extra cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that bone marrow is additionally efficient.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBone marrow will do it even faster than that.\n\n Bone marrow is stem cell.\n\n It is all stem cell.\n\n That means the body can take a bone marrow cell and make a liver cell, a nerve cell, any cell in the body.\n\n\r\nIt's a transmogrification.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere do you get it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's only one source we have here?\n\n It's very hard getting it.\n\n We should all applaud her.\n\n\r\nShe got the sources for glands, good organic buffalo glands, and the bone marrow.\n\n \r\nIf you want any of those to help get well faster, take her number after this and give her a call.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI wanna order the bone marrow after, cause she can't stand it at the same time because they have to let the animal hang for 10 days.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Laser Surgery \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI got two of them that were like that and I suggested they have laser surgery\n\n So, they had laser surgery, and one of 'em was 10 years ago, and the other one was 8 years ago and they had no recession.\n\n They heal quicker than anybody else the doctors had seen anybody heal and they'd produced no scar tissue there and they were fine.\n\n\r\nIt's the only surgery I recommend.\n\n**[END OF CLIP]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Laxatives & Chia Seeds With Lube Formula \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's not a good idea\n\n If you need something to help make laxative.\n\n Like the man who came here earlier who didn't even stay for anything other than just to thank me.\n\n His wife had been on diet for about 2 years.\n\n  \r\nShe's a person who couldn't even drink water.\n\n She started the diet.\n\n \r\nNow she's gained about 30 pounds, she was skin and bones, she was going to die.\n\n Now she's fine.\n\n He thought it was a crazy diet, but he didn't have any other choice, but to watch her go through it.\n\n After a year on the diet, he started experimenting.\n\n Now he's come to me as a client, but he was doing these other things.\n\n I told him the diet and he was doing his version of the diet because he knew better.\n\n \r\nSo, I just had a consultation with him last week and I said, you don't do that.\n\n This is why you have to do this and that.\n\n So, he was giving me this resistance for about 15 minutes, and I just laid it out there, said, this is the way, just do it.\n\n See what happens.\n\n He came to tell me that all his problems disappeared in just a few days.\n\n \r\nBut he was the one that has a lot of constipation problems.\n\n And I said, don't grind the flax seed, all of that garbage because it has phytic acid in it.\n\n It'll prevent you from absorbing your D vitamins.\n\n You go towards depression; you have anxiety attacks if you do that with flax seeds.\n\n He wanted to take chia seeds.\n\n \r\nSoak them in water for about 6 to 10 hours, they'll puff out with all this gelatin.\n\n Mix that with a lubrication formula or some cream.\n\n You want it to taste like a nice cereal.\n\n Add cream and honey?\n\n  \r\nI said, never chop your seeds into hard substances because it takes hours for it to soften.\n\n So, it's gonna go into your intestines and start slashing into it then you're gonna up more constipated.\n\n If you want to take the flax seeds, they will also produce the same kind of mucus like gelatin, but not like the chia seeds and not as quick.\n\n Chia seeds are a very fine little seed that they feed birds, but you can find it in some health food stores.\n\n Very fine seed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou have to get it organic though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, because it doesn't absorb, none of that absorbs?\n\n It takes a bird, a very hardy bird to digest it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhy take it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTo help people who don't have good peristalsis and they don't have good E coli to cause bowel movements?\n\n So, it's just to help them move cause some people who don't have the bacteria, the E coli to produce enough fecal matter or enough bacteria to discharge, the toxins will stay and they're highly acrid, and they don't have enough mucus in that bowel cause they had too many colonics or enemas, the toxic substances that are in the bowel will irritate the intestinal walls and cause ulcerations and even more constipation, and then they'll get headaches, all kinds of problems.\n\n  \r\nThey'[re mean and nasty like the alligators from Texas that had no asshole I dunno, \r\nsomebody gets those jokes.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Letting Teeth Go \n \n \n \n \n### (33) Lost 25 Pound From Costa Rica Customs \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI lost so much weight\n\n I lost almost 25 pound going to Costa Rico because they took a lot of my food away when I got in there.\n\n Their customs, but their agriculture is as bad as we are.\n\n Don't let anything in their country.\n\n They took my eggs away.\n\n They took my honey away; I did smuggle some butter.\n\n \r\nI didn't tell 'em what some of my butter was, so they didn't take it all, some of my cream.\n\n You couldn't get it back.\n\n They're not gonna keep it for 14 days.\n\n Can you imagine what a storage house they would have.\n\n They throw it away?\n\n So, I didn't have the food that I needed there, and I didn't find a place to get raw butter until my last two days there, but there was a health food store there that had raw butter from water buffalo, and raw milk and everything.\n\n \r\nSo, I chowed down.\n\n It wasn't enough to really get me back, and then I started going through a heavy detoxification, even before I went.\n\n I went in April.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Magnesium & Cauterized Mienrals From Supplements \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nQuick question, first is where to get magnesium\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, magnesium occurs in all food?\n\n  High in parsley and green leafy vegetables, high in milk, it's high in cheeses, all dairy products are very high in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about nuts.\n\n Almonds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but almonds are too difficult to digest for any human, but if you have nut formula, you will get a certain amount, but you can't get all the phytic acid out, so  I only recommend it once or twice a week?\n\n\r\nMeat is your best source of magnesium.\n\n Just remember that you don't need all of those counterbalancing minerals when you're eating a raw diet.\n\n When you pasteurize, even when you just take the milk up to 141°, you cauterize 50% of the calcium to balance that toxic mineral and the potassium is destroyed at like 97°.\n\n It's altered 97 degrees.\n\n \r\nSo, you have all these mineral imbalances.\n\n You have to have a lot of other minerals: potassium, magnesium to deal with all of these cauterized minerals.\n\n When you're eating it raw, there's no excessive need for calcium, and excessive need for magnesium or potassium.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does cauterize mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBurn, solidify?\n\n Take clay, and when you fire it, what happens.\n\n Turns it sharp and hard?\n\n That's cauterized.\n\n It solidifies that it, it just seals it into a form where it can't be bioactive anymore.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIf you boil mineral water, all the white cauterized minerals on the bottom.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's cauterized minerals and that's what comes out your teeth?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's inside the kettle and all that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's inside your body.\n\n Everything you eat that's cooked forms that in the body, you have all that mineral product, that chalk.\n\n It's all very poor mineral relationship.\n\n\r\nThat's why everybody has osteoporosis and breaks.\n\n They get brittle bones as they get older.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Mercury Fillings \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYour mouth is full of gold fillings and a few of the other kinds, like you said mercury\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI recommend getting rid of amalgams, as long as you're having trouble with sleeping and radio waves.\n\n What it does is it gases and the mercury vapors crystallize, and they absorb into the body and damage cells.\n\n They can damage about 1000 healthy cells.\n\n One molecule crystal of the mercury will destroy 1000 surrounding cells, a big bomb.\n\n So, it's a good idea to get rid of it.\n\n \r\n1000 cells is no big deal.\n\n You can fit at a couple million cells on the end of a pinhead, but still, collectively.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you have to go to a dentist who knows how to do remove it properly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Puts a dam in there to make sure you don't breathe it and inhale it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Minerals In Vegetable Juice \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're always gonna keep up with that loss\n\n And the vegetable juice is your vitamin, enzymes and mineral supplement.\n\n All bioactive, all very utilizable and let me tell you, four glasses a day fat exceeds the mineral concentration that your body could even use in one day, unless you were an athletes, working out 5, 8 hours a day.\n\n\r\nThose people I have taking 16 ounces of juice at a time, 4 to 5 times a day.\n\n Sometimes a quart at a time if you're six foot something tall.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Natural Clay Can Be Toxic \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust remember that clays are toxic\n\n I built a hot tub out at my place big concrete one.\n\n And I wanted to color the cement, so I got natural oxide to color it, but what happens is after you know, about five or six days of that water settling in there oxides started coming into the water and I started getting symptoms.\n\n\r\nAnd the way I found that out was because I let the algae grow and after it turned green and was very thick, all of a sudden, it started to turn yellow.\n\n So, the cadmium oxide was a part substance of that natural clay when I put in the cement, so it was killing the algae.\n\n It was turning yellow and dying.\n\n\r\nSo, um, I'm debating whether I'll tile it now.\n\n\r\nSo, even natural clays can be toxic, you just have to be careful.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n**[unclear]**\n doesn't have enough iron in it to chelate to the cadmium.\n\n\r\nSo, you just have to be careful.\n\n I've learned so much in the past six months of studying this clay, I'm still not satisfied to be able to provide.\n\n \r\nSo, coral calcium is probably the least toxic clay to use.\n\n \r\nYes, I'm working with it right now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPascalite?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a clay?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIs it a green clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's a beige clay, but it comes from a thermal bed, which I'm not happy with because those mienrals are cauterized at high temperatures?\n\n\r\nAnd this thermal bed is like 700 degrees deep in the earth.\n\n\r\nSo, of course that was millions of years ago, but I still don't like using cauterized minerals.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Orthodontist Took Out 4 Teeth \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe braces  shrunk my mouth, and my tongue was so big that I couldn't speak\n\n I lisped all the time cause my tongue didn't fit in my mouth.\n\n This is the stupidity of some people out there.\n\n \"Oh, I'm gonna rearrange his mouth\".\n\n Well, what size is the tongue.\n\n He didn't think about that?\n\n \r\nSo, I had to take scissors and keep cutting this membrane right here, so that my tongue would go back farther, so I could speak probably?\n\n That was pretty rough and I haven't had to do it for about 15 years because it's not growing back anymore, but it would grow back and I would have to cut it again.\n\n I used parashears.\n\n Parashears are sharp.\n\n *Clip* painful for a few seconds.\n\n\r\nI'd turn red.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI pierced my ears with self piercing.\n\n They got infected, oh my God.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut that didn't infect, I was taken care of on a good diet.\n\n I have nine teeth that should be in there that don't exist: four, because of the orthodontist, four because of the wisdoms teeth that the dentist took out, and one that just rotted out in that experience in 1982.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Oysters Remove Toxic Substances & Farmed Is Fine \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOysters are very helpful\n\n It's funny, oysters have the ability to take some of the most toxic substances and they build it in the shell, rather than bring it into the body.\n\n  \r\nI had one of the most toxic people that I'd ever seen, grew up under an airport and she was loaded with metal poisoning.\n\n \r\nAnd I said if you eat three dozen oysters a week, you could probably eliminate- because she was going through fibromyalgia really bad.\n\n So, she barely had enough energy to get outta bed every day.\n\n She ate three dozen a week for an entire year.\n\n She got rid of one third of her metal poisoning in one year.\n\n I've never seen anybody do that before.\n\n She was diligent.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes that go for osteoporosis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCorrect?\n\n \r\nThere's something about the cell of an oyster that can take a mineral from any substance and make good out of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do you know if they are farm raised or naturally grown in the ocean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll oysters and clams are farmed raised?\n\n However, all that means to a oyster and a clam is that they have a fence that blocks off a part of the ocean, and they're now allowed to claim that as their farm, so people can't trespass.\n\n  \r\nThe only thing that they do is not natural; sometimes they'll take the offspring, separate it from the mother and plant it in different areas, but they don't feed it garbage.\n\n They don't feed.\n\n It's only fed what's naturally in the ocean because they found out they screw up their reproduction and they don't reproduce it if they feed them.\n\n So, it's completely natural except for the fence.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat do they eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhatever's in the water, the ocean water?\n\n Well, There's \r\nWell, the jars are glass, so that's fine, but it's still probably better to have them fresh.\n\n That means it’s still alive.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Pain \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThere is no such thing as a pain that's debilitating as long as you're on good diet\n\n Pain is always a result of the body correcting itself.\n\n It's swelling in a particular area.\n\n The body's always trying to heal itself.\n\n It will correct itself if you're feeding it the right nutrients, whether you are on the diet or off the diet, you go through the same pain.\n\n \r\nIt's just that you will go through less pain on the diet and you will cleanse properly and heal properly.\n\n I was crawling on the floor like a worm cause I was in such pain after they cauterized my spine from the radiation.\n\n I was in so severe pain; I couldn't move my entire body.\n\n I had to crawl on the floor like this, take me 30 minutes to get across the room.\n\n \r\nSo, I had gallon jars that I had urinated in.\n\n Buckets that I shat in, and then somebody would come and clean them out every couple of days.\n\n So, my house stunk like hell, but that's the way I lived cause I was in severe pain, but I was on a good diet and I knew I just had to wait it out, get it through.\n\n \r\nI mean, I tried to commit suicide a couple times.\n\n It didn't work, so I had to endure it.\n\n So, no pain is not justified, you wanna reduce it with good nutrients.\n\n Pain formula that's in the book will reduce it most of the time.\n\n Hot water bottles to relax the area, so it doesn't cause pressure on the nerves, and that will reduce pain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBack pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's again, swelling in that area, and that joint?\n\n**[unclear]**\n, and eat the pain formula once or twice a day with your meat.\n\n \r\nEric, do you have a question.\n\n**[Eric]**\n \r\nI have back pain that just won't go away?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPeople who've had back injuries and back problems like we do spend the rest of their life in pain.\n\n He only goes through it maybe three or four weeks.\n\n**[Eric]**\n \r\nThe last time it was only like 17 days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh terrific.\n\n That's what happens on this diet.\n\n You go through a detoxification, each time you start cleaning out that area, it gets to the point where it's clean.\n\n It's quick.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow long does it take the body to start detoxing and cleaning.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends upon the individual?\n\n You saw our milk man, James Stewart.\n\n He went two and a half years on the diet without ever going through a detox.\n\n He had been a vegetarian for almost 30 years.\n\n He was 50 years old when he went on the diet, he was 138 pounds.\n\n 6' 3'', 138 pounds.\n\n \r\nHe's not skinny anymore, now he's 210.\n\n So, he had gone all his life eating nothing, but chips and garbage.\n\n So, his body took two and a half years just to strengthen itself to get ready to detox.\n\n Other people will go right into it.\n\n All depends.\n\n It's an individual thing.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Parasites \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAfraid of getting parasites and bacterial infections is such an absurdity\n\n  \r\nI'm in that category of oxygenarian who doesn't produce any hydrochloric acid and they said when I was 20 years old, when they did that, they said you will never be able to eat raw foods again, they will kill you.\n\n If you get a bacterial, parasitical infection.\n\n \r\nI've eaten parasite infected meat that undulated with the pinworms and, and calves' brain that was full of parasites and chicken tripe that was full of the parasites and never got one.\n\n I had my feces and blood checked for 10 weeks after, and I never got one parasite.\n\n  \r\nThe doctors and scientists think, \"Oh, this is how it probably is and therefore it is\".\n\n And it's written in stone.\n\n It's got nothing to do with reality.\n\n So, no need to be afraid and go through life, terrified to the raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen you're talking about parasites.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTake your own bodies.\n\n We lose skin cells every day.\n\n Before there were showers and baths, guess what you did.\n\n You had salmonella bodies, billions of them on your arms and body that would eat these dead human cells?\n\n Eat them.\n\n  \r\nThat's what salmonella was there to do, eat the dead cells.\n\n So, you didn't cake up and dry out.\n\n They were helping you, it's a symbiotic relationship.\n\n You have these small protozoa type parasites that live on waste products: very, very small molecules of animal flash that have degenerated.\n\n So, they're all good.\n\n \r\nWell, it's because you had too much rock in your system and you weren't on a good diet, so you weren't cleansing properly and you weren't healing properly.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Phytics Acid \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's hard to digest, I heard you mention phytic acid\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll nuts have phytic acid, all seed to have phytic acid.\n\n Phytic acid prevents the body from digesting protein for 24 to 48 hours later.\n\n Average is 36 hours, Not only the protein in the nuts, but any other protein, whether it's eggs, milk, or meat that you eat afterwards.\n\n \r\nSo, that's why I worked very hard at coming up with a formula to use with the nuts that neutralized the phytic acid.\n\n And that's grinding the nut until it's a flour, adding the egg, a fat (butter), and honey.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Pineapple Builds Bones & Citrus Demineralizes \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGrapefruit doesn't react as badly, and also pineapple actually helps mend the bones and reverse osteoporosis\n\n The Tangerine, the orange, the lemon, the lime will help deteriorate the bones.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou can't suck on a lemon or a lime, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI didn't make the world this way?\n\n Don't be upset with me.\n\n I just observe and tell you what it does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFish or chicken when you put it in lemon.\n\n You shouldn't have that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's fine because there's enough substances in there for the lemon to work on.\n\n It's not gonna damage the mineral balance of it unless you have it too often.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do you mean, you can't put too much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n If you have it every day, if you have lemon and chicken every day, you're going to have some mineral deficiencies?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, you shouldn't eat chicken every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Lemon and chicken.\n\n Nobody should eat lemon every day.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nAnd we have that chicken for three days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you eat it every day for three days, it's not going to cause mineral deficiency.\n\n If you ate it every day for 10 days, you better believe you're gonna start having mineral deficiencies.\n\n\r\nIt depends upon the individual.\n\n If your teeth start getting more sensitive, you are having too much lemon.\n\n Your gums start getting sensitive, any part of your body starts getting sensitive.\n\n You've had too much citrus, back off.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat about the lube formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe lube formula has such a small amount of it in relationship with the fat?\n\n \r\nThat's why it usually doesn't harm marinated fish, because you have the fats to utilize the citric acid.\n\n In the process of utilizing fat as energy or as utilizing it as a solvent to dissolve toxins in the body, the body uses 80% fat, 15% proteins and 5% citric acid or alcohol the body will make by fermenting carbohydrates in the system.\n\n \r\nFats are usually accompanied by a lot of minerals.\n\n All fats are concentrated with minerals, nothing to worry about, but if you use a lot, like some people use an awful lot of lemon juice to marinate their chicken and they're eating/drinking all of that lemon use along with it, they're going to create an imbalance.\n\n Fat and mineral deficiency, it's going to start leeching it out of the body.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Radiations & Cat Scan \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMore radiation, that's all I need *laughs*\r\nIt takes years to get rid of radiation\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat about a cat scan.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's worse?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI know, but how many years to get rid of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n20 years from the cat scan?\n\n You have to understand, your body is made of minerals.\n\n A lot of them are metallic, especially if you eaten cooked foods.\n\n You have a lot of solidified metal in your system, it is not raw.\n\n Cauterized minerals, solid metals that when they are irradiated, they stay active for sometimes 150 years.\n\n\r\nYou cannot dissolve all of that out of your bone from a diet overnight.\n\n It could take 30, 40 years to get rid of it all.\n\n So, every time you get a dose of radiation, you're reactivating.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut you mentioned avocados and oranges.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOranges will help get it out of the softer tissue?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Receeding Gums \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nProbably detrimental because when I followed 4 people for a 10 year period\n\n.\n\n.\n\n every animal in nature has receding gums, so pocket gets larger the older they are, but it works in increments.\n\n It's not a bad thing until you're way down below 32, the youth level, the child level.\n\n\r\nAnd there's no harm in that.\n\n Dentist may a fortune on getting people to come in and get cleanings and then to take medication for that, and that's a natural thing.\n\n There's  no disease associated with it.\n\n Disease is associated with eating lots of sugars that rot the teeth from the inside, not the outside.\n\n\r\nThey love to blame bacteria on the outside, but there's no test that proves that because where does the bacteria come from.\n\n Mainly comes from the inside, and goes out the tubules?\n\n Keeps being discharged out in the dentine and that weakens the dentine, then the cavity starts.\n\n I'm sure bacteria or plaquing can irritate it and cause it to be progressive.\n\n\r\nWell, if you have severe plaque that has a lot of acid in it, I had a vagotomy, which means I had an operation, which severed all the nerves to my stomach, so I wouldn't produce hydrochloric acid.\n\n \r\nWhat that did for me was, all the acid backs up into my mouth.\n\n That's when my teeth started rotting heavily because all my hydrochloric acid was going into my mouth, instead of my stomach.\n\n So, my teeth were just rotting away quickly, and still my teeth are okay comparatively, I still have my teeth.\n\n These are all my teeth.\n\n I don't have any implants, and I was supposed to lose them 35 years ago.\n\n\r\nThat to me is a good thing.\n\n My teeth aren't perfect, but I can use them.\n\n I can chew on the stuff with my teeth, it's enjoyable.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou have your wisdom teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n\r\nThey were taking out when I was a kid.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Red Eyes & Egg Whites \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the question is, first of all, my mother has a terrible bad eye\n\n Left eye is really red inside.\n\n What do you suggest for that eye.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPutting some egg white in that eye?\n\n Your mother doesn't do anything I say, so.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBecause they said it's macular degeneration from her nerve.\n\n The eye doctor looked at it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, your mother's not well.\n\n Your mother's not well at all.\n\n One of the meanest people I know.\n\n She's toxic from it.\n\n So, I don't know that anything's gonna help her much.\n\n If you get her put the egg white in her eye, it will help.\n\n\r\nIt will feed the protein right through the cornea so that she can maybe stabilize that deterioration.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBlood shot all over.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Red Meat For Eyes \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy ophthalmologist told me that a high percentage of people grow old have their vitreous humor pull away from the vent it's happened a tremendous amount\n\n\r\nI was just wondering is it possible to alleviate that situation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBelieve it or not, red meat.\n\n Red meat with cream and butter combined.\n\n \r\nTheoretically, you think that because the eye is more nerves than anything else than muscle, that it would be like nerves reconstituted with white meat there, but in all of my experiments with people and myself, red meat is the only thing that will clear up the focus and the floaters, which are waste products your body's not breaking down.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow much red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends upon the individual?\n\n So, even as much as it takes to refocus.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAnd for people who are jitterish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a little different?\n\n That's more white meat.\n\n i\r\nI've had quite a few people do it.\n\n Some people on the diet for a long time, it stopped their advancement, but it didn't clear up the eye as much.\n\n Some people who put egg white in their eyes restored their vision and butter in their eyes and restored their vision, improved greatly as long as they follow the diet.\n\n\r\nIf you don't replace the nutrients properly, you're not gonna rebuild the eye and the fat isn't gonna do it greatly.\n\n Need the protein from the egg white, but it was always in conjunction with that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Removing Mercury Filling With Cancer \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThere mercury out\n\n No, I say if somebody has cancer?\n\n, you wait until you get through with the cancer first.\n\n Laurie had about 20 to 30 tumors in the right breast.\n\n Right breast was a third larger than the right, hard as rock.\n\n She had cancer in her right hip bone and in the right kidney attached to the adrenal gland.\n\n \r\nShe had a mouthful of amalgams and I suggested that she wait till she stabilized, and it took her two years to get rid of the cancer in the breast.\n\n She couldn't get rid of the ones in the hip or the adrenal gland.\n\n So, I suggested after three and a half years on the diet to eat some fecal matter cause of the University of Toronto was using the Veratoxin byproduct that completely dissolved human brain tumors in 2 - 7 days, including the vessels going to it.\n\n They've been doing that for 29 years.\n\n Why isn't that available.\n\n Why isn't that information out?\n\n And now 18 universities are using it in Canada, and The United States?\n\n They're using the measle bacteria.\n\n They're using cold, flu, salmonella.\n\n They did the salmonella stuff last year.\n\n Put out a product called attenuated salmonella, it goes in and chokes off the oxygen to the tumor, it does not eat it as it naturally does.\n\n \r\nSo, they'll charge you $8,000 for a shot of salmonella when you can just let some chicken rot or some eggs rot and eat it, and then they charge you $12,000 to inject a solvent to dissolve the tumor.\n\n So, $20,000 for one therapy, and you can just go eat shit and live.\n\n Basically, that's what it is.\n\n She said, \"Well, where do I get the fecal matter\".\n\n \r\nI said, \"Well, it has to be a good clean animal\"?\n\n It has to be a healthy, organic animal.\n\n And she said, \"Where am I gonna get one\".\n\n I said, \"Well, we've got gophers all over the yard.\n\n You want me to shoot a couple\".\n\n And she said, \"Yeah\"?\n\n So, I took my crossbow and shot a couple of gophers, and she ate the gopher guts.\n\n \r\nAnd within two and a half months, the tumors connected to the kidneys dissolved by a third and the one in the hip decreased by the third.\n\n So, she eats fecal matter on a regular basis out there in Hawaii.\n\n She'll take part of it when they slaughter a goat or sheep.\n\n She'll cut the bowel out and she has everybody eating shit.\n\n \r\nAnd all the animals eat shit, except for humans, civilized humans.\n\n There are tribes that don't get enough protein, so they'll eat the fecal matter that's already dumped in the field.\n\n They'll just sit there and eat it like it's nothing, and it tastes just like overcooked vegetables.\n\n \r\nWhy they did it is because the cow has it pre-digested, but there's a lot of protein that we can get get from it.\n\n So, that's why all animals eat fecal matters if they can't get enough meat and the bacteria will keep them from cancer.\n\n And I've had probably 10 people do it.\n\n  \r\nI had one girl with advanced cancer in San Francisco that I've been talking to her about eating fecal, and she wouldn't do it.\n\n When I was in Nevada city in April and we shot a wild Turkey and I put all the bowel and its content in a jar because I was going to do a seminar and workshop in San Francisco following that one, where she lived.\n\n So, her boyfriend and I sat around one evening, like two little boys, bad little boys who would get the little girl neighbor to eat shit.\n\n \r\nSo, we finally got her eat the shit, and I got this email from her two weeks later and she said, \"I cannot tell you the difference and feeling that I went from the next day, even though that I was in fear, I felt so much better, and it felt that way since\".\n\n And she's getting ready for her second helping of turkey shit with the bowels, actually the bowels.\n\n Because if a person has cancer and their E coli isn't flourishing in their intestines, they're in trouble.\n\n Allows for metastasis.\n\n \r\nSo, if you eat the bowel along with the fecal matter, it will help you restore your own environment to help your own E coli grow and produce.\n\n So, the medical profession makes a fortune on bacteria phobia and let me tell you, we've been working with bacteria for millions of years, millions of years.\n\n \r\nNobody washed their hands before they wiped their buts and everything.\n\n It's so absurd to think that we're all of a sudden.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Root Canal \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHave a root canal\n\n We've already had one done.\n\n There is a space in the base of the tooth, which is very, very fine and small.\n\n Now because the nerve there is the most sensitive, they don't drill down to that little pocket and it's difficult for them to get down there and drill in anyway when you're going down into a deep tooth to do that.\n\n \r\nSo, they'll grind out the nerve, deteriorate the nerve all the way down to that little bitty, one centimeter of tissue that's in that little pocket.\n\n  \r\nNow, normally in a person who doesn't get fed well, what will happen is that'll abscess.\n\n And then the body will start pouring the puss out to get rid of those dead cells that are decaying there.\n\n \r\nOn this diet, you have enough nutrients that you don't have to worry about that.\n\n What the dentist love to do is charge you about $2000, and go in there and cut the gum open, scrape that off, and then reseal it.\n\n The amount of repair that you have to do is going to far exceed the process of your body using bacteria to get rid of that little bit of decaying flesh in that little bitty pocket, or little bitty space.\n\n \r\nSo, if you're on the diet, let's say, 85%, 95%, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n I'd say even if you're doing it less, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n You just have to deal with an abscess that's going to come out your gum and secrete and it'll stink and smell awful and be pusy, but it's much easier and a lot of less expensive and a lot of us damage to your overall constitutions than having surgery.\n\n \r\nThe people that are very, very ill and very old, surgery can be a relief because they don't get enough nutrients to detox the area, and to keep up with that kind of infectious byproduct.\n\n Now, the infection is not a bad thing, but bacteria goes in there and eats the decaying tissue, and then it has waste products.\n\n \r\nBut what bacteria does is when it eats this degenerative tissue, just like we'll take 7 pounds of food a day or more, and we'll reduce it into one nice elongated fecal matter, and that's what bacteria do.\n\n They reduce all this contamination into a small substance that's easier to deal with.\n\n \r\nThat's why I encourage people to eat shit and live if they have cancer or eat high bacterial meat to get in there and eat up tumors or whatever is degenerative in your body.\n\n That's the thing to do is to infect yourself with bacteria.\n\n So, it'll go in there and do it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Steam & Sauana Vs Hot Bath \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nCan you use a steam room\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, because it burns the sinuses?\n\n It will burn the lungs, damage the mucus membranes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, the sauna would be better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you're in that kind of hot- you have to understand steam is 212°?\n\n  \r\nThat burns the mucus right through the mucus themselves.\n\n So, you reduce your ability to absorb oxygen, you'll reduce your ability to produce mucus that protects you from pollution.\n\n Not a good thing.\n\n Very risky.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nUm, I do a fair amount of work on my car, and then recently I've gotten a little concerned.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBlade operators and mechanics.\n\n \r\nBlade is a machine that you turn something, and you cut it, shave it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, I should wear gloves and just touch as little.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd if you're playing around with brake fluid or kerosene, you better wear a mask?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh really.\n\n Does your cream help at all?\n\n I've been using that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it does.\n\n You put it in your hands and then put gloves over that.\n\n Protect you a lot better.\n\n Put it on your face, anywhere your body's exposed cause those vapors will come up and get right into your skin, and those are heavy metals, they're vaporized.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLike if you touch it, it does.\n\n Does it stay in your skin, or does it get absorbed right into your body too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, it's into the skin and absorbs into the body cause the lymph has to deal with it?\n\n  \r\nThe lymph system can't handle it and it'll be absorbed into all kinds of tissue.\n\n \r\nVery toxic.\n\n All mechanics and blade operators.\n\n Especially airplane.\n\n They use more solvents than any mechanic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Sugar \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust remember that there's a difference between the sugar that feeds cancer and the natural sugars that exist in nature\n\n Anytime you use carbohydrate as a sugar in the body as glycogen, you have a 70& to 80% byproduct.\n\n If that is a processed, cooked sugar, you have all these cauterized minerals along with it, so that causes heavy plaquing and contamination in the system.\n\n\r\nThose irritate and destroy cells.\n\n That is carbohydrate damage, a sugar damage cell.\n\n That's what destroy cells, body mummifies them, because it can't dissolve them and get rid of them, and that's what accumulates and makes tumors.\n\n Sugar destroys more cells in the human body than any other contaminant.\n\n \r\nThat's why lots of tribes who eat cooked meat don't get cancer because they don't live on sugars.\n\n All of the civilizations that live mainly on carbs, grains and stuff like that: have tapeworms, they have cancers, they all kinds of distortions.\n\n \r\nNow I've been travelling to Taiwan and Thailand in February, and I just left Costa Rica a few weeks ago and they got these third world people believing that they should not eat meat at all, they should only grains and beans.\n\n All of these kids that have babies, you know, 16 and 20, 22 years old, they have these babies.\n\n that have no ethnicity to them?\n\n \r\nThese are children and they all have a gray complexion.\n\n They are not well and crisp, you know, vibrant looking.\n\n They are white, and gray from these diets.\n\n Carbohydrate is the worst thing that human can eat in the form of grains, potatoes, beans.\n\n The worst.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Sun Can Burn Retina \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut if your eyes are too sensitive, you can burn your retina\n\n So, some people have to have sunglasses, but it's best to have them away from your eyes, so little bits of sunlight can pass through.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Swelling Helps Bruises & Ice Damages Cartilage \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat you recommend as an additional treatment\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAmputation! *Laughs* anytime you have a bruised cartilage nerves can bruise too, you have to have swelling.\n\n Circulation has to come in there, remove the bruised tissue and damage byproducts in order for the knee to repair itself or the joint to repair itself.\n\n  \r\nThat's why athletes burn out very young in life.\n\n They keep putting ice on something, it never cleanses properly.\n\n The tissue stays in there, gradually their cartilage isn't solid and doesn't work anymore.\n\n So, they get shots of cortisone to numb the nerves and keep doing that until they're useless.\n\n They are tribes in the Andes and all over the world that even at 90 years old, they're still running 200 miles a year.\n\n \r\nThey do a football exercise (soccer) where they'll go through the mountains cause it's not as much oxygen, 200 miles.\n\n They play this game once a year.\n\n They don't have that problem cause they never use ice under bruises or anything.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you put hot water bottles there, it helps all the tendons relax, so that the swelling can occur without the pain.\n\n \r\nRemember, the pain is the swelling in the nerve endings, the capillaries, the nerve platelets.\n\n So, you just have to make sure everything's heated, so it relaxes and expands.\n\n \r\nSo, the best thing to do is apply heat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow long after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nImmediately?\n\n For days until the pain stops.\n\n Any kind of pain you have, apply hot water, always.\n\n Any circumstance.\n\n  \r\nEven when it's internal, you have pain in your liver.\n\n When your pain is a problem after eating a lubrication formula, put a hot water bottle here, so that the liver relaxes then it can start working properly.\n\n  \r\nAfter I ate the poison mushroom my liver was in severe pain.\n\n I got headaches from that liver pain, but lemme tell you, I forced myself to eat a pound and a half to two pounds of butter a day cause I knew that liver would shut down if I didn't force it.\n\n  \r\nAnd I lived, I strapped two hot water bottles to my stomach, so that I could get through it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt keeps down the swelling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, what it does is it allows everything to relax and stretch and expand without the pain, without tearing, and pull and pressure?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about swelling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSame thing?\n\n Swelling of the liver, swelling is what causes the pain.\n\n If everything relaxes, it can take this expansion without pain.\n\n \r\nStill use the hot water bottle cause it will increase circulation, so you can clean that area out quickly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWould heat actually cause swelling to worsen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFor a few minutes, but it doesn't increase the pain?\n\n It reduces the pain.\n\n Once everything starts relax, it actually reduces the pain.\n\n It just takes about five minutes.\n\n \r\nBecause that increases circulation, circulation means more nutrients in, and more waste products out.\n\n \r\nYou have to have the swelling or you don't cleanse and you don't heal and you end up like all the athletes pumped by coaches and doctors with aerosol and steroids, packed with ice, so they can get right back on the field.\n\n \r\nNot if you're on good diet.\n\n Sure, if you've got very tight tendons, you wouldn't be an athlete in the first place and if you're an athlete, you could handle heat.\n\n That's what they do say, for three days use ice, then use heat.\n\n Your most critical stage is in the first three days to get rid of bruised toxics substances out of that area.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Teeth Brushing \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about brushing your teeth\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBrushing your teeth?\n\n I think is a good thing because of the plaque?\n\n You have toxic minerals that secrete through the gums.\n\n That's why you have that plaque on there.\n\n Those are minerals that have been cooked, but when you take clay, it's the same way.\n\n\r\nOnce you fire a clay, what happens to it.\n\n It's a hard sharp substance?\n\n When that comes out the gums, it causes plaque on the teeth, you need to get of that.\n\n Cause it will choke off the dentine and that can cause more abscess or it can cause it to discharge from the nerves and the pustules, leaving the plaque on the teeth.\n\n\r\nI brush whenever I feel the plaque solid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOnce a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnce a day is fine?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you brush with I brush with.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI brush with an adult soft toothbrush that's all boar bristle because if I accidentally get one of those plastic things in my stomach, guess what I'm putting in my body?\n\n Dioxin, BPA plastic?\n\n I'm eating plastic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Teeth Caps Came Off \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI started to say earlier when I had one of these caps come off, I had two caps to the left\n\n Two came off and I just left them off.\n\n So, two right here, one of them came off.\n\n Now they've been on since 1978.\n\n They've been on a long time.\n\n One of 'em popped out 10 years ago.\n\n I said, well, I'm not gonna go have the epoxy put on there.\n\n \r\nSo, I took bees wax I was chewing.\n\n I took a spoon, and made it into a very thin waver.\n\n I mean, paper thin.\n\n Then I pressed it beside the tooth and put it on and just bit it.\n\n It's been on for almost 11 years, and when I went to a dentist about five years ago, I forgot which one it was.\n\n So, I said, would you do me a favor and go there and try to pull, I just want to see what the tooth looks like under the beeswax.\n\n How much.\n\n the tooth has oxidized.\n\n Like if it does the same thing as it would if it had the epoxy on it, he couldn't get either one off.\n\n He didn't know which one it was.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Teeth Cleaning and Recession \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you get cleanings, what happens, they take the knife way down here, they keep cutting\n\n \r\nHow much recession do you think is caused by cleaning.\n\n Most of it?\n\n When I stopped having cleanings done on my teeth, the recession stopped.\n\n I stopped having cleanings in the late eighties, and then I only had one in 1979.\n\n\r\n1978 when I had all my amalgams taken out and had mostly composites put back in seven root canals, and crowns.\n\n And then I had another cleaning in the mid eighties and I go to a dentist every once in a while, just to have them check the pocket depth to see it hasn't grown.\n\n Hasn't gone any lower than 1 in 10 years.\n\n\r\nWell, just brush with the right food, brush with the right foods.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Teeth Deteriation \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSomething I haven't really gone into in the book, and it disturbs a lot of people because it's a painful area\n\n It's a delicate area.\n\n I think I mentioned that after chemo and radiation in surgery, my teeth just dangled.\n\n All the bone deteriorated around my teeth.\n\n  \r\nSo, they were all loose and very painful, and if I bit down, I'd lose half a cup of blood each time I bit down.\n\n So, I had to drink everything through a straw.\n\n Of course, I was a vegetarian, fruitarian.\n\n So, that was easy to do at the time, but of course, that sugar and high sugar kept the bone from growing, and it wasn't until I started eating dairy products and meat that my teeth solidified again to where I didn't lose them.\n\n \r\nBut they wanted to pull all of them when I was 21 years old.\n\n And I said, if I'm going to my grave, I'm going to my grave with my teeth.\n\n So he says, what does it matter if you're in your grave.\n\n \r\nI said I'm already ugly?\n\n \r\nSo, I refused to do it and it's been a lot of healing with my teeth because they pretty much rotted.\n\n They were rotted by about 50% by the time I was 28 years old on an all-fruit diet.\n\n And then at 29 a half, I began eating a meat and then it changed.\n\n My teeth started solidifying, bones started growing quickly, everything started growing.\n\n \r\nTook about 13 years to stabilize.\n\n I had no pain; I had several teeth that I refused to get filled because I want to see what it would be like naturally to experience it.\n\n I don't suggest people do that because you will lose teeth doing that.\n\n I suggest if you have holes in your teeth, you get fillings.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Teeth Grow Back & Cavity Reversal \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe wisdom teeth can grow back\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI dunno?\n\n I had only witnessed a few people growing teeth in their later life, and I only witnessed a couple of young people in their twenties who had huge open cavities and from drinking the milk and eating the raw food products and the meats that their teeth grew back, cavities grew back.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI was talking about the wisdom teeth they pull out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know.\n\n There's some belief that there's a seed at the base of the tooth, and when they extract and pull it out, they pull the seed with it.\n\n So, if you had your wisdom teeth or any teeth pulled, there's a possibility you won't grow the tooth back.\n\n And the only people that I know that have grown teeth back at advanced ages, all let their teeth rot out naturally.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Third Set Of Teeth \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThere are several records of people in later life growing a third set of teeth\n\n  \r\nSo, I just got a medical report from a Vietnam 90-year-old man who grew a third set of teeth.\n\n He had been toothless since he was 60, so he liked this.\n\n \r\nHe could start eating all those things he couldn't eat again.\n\n So, I don't want to contaminate it, with any epoxies or anything, because I have such severe damage in my teeth that when the fillings pop out, I just leave them exposed.\n\n So, I may go with dentures for a while and just hope the teeth will grow eventually.\n\n \r\nBut on this diet, there are several things that will happen, that will not happen to people that are not on the diet.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) Tinitus \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs tinnitus a possible cause of having gold fillings\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n If the mercury's going back and embedding.\n\n Gold, no.\n\n\r\nTinnitus is from swelling in the ear canal.\n\n You've got some kind of toxicity in the eardrum and the increased circulation cleans the area, causes the swelling.\n\n \r\nIt's like anytime you have swelling in the ear.\n\n If you've ever had a sore throat, ear ache, everything rings.\n\n Using the swelling, the extra fluid in there.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Tomatoes Over Acidic & Geographical Tongue \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt can cause over acidity in some people, because if you eat a lot of tomato sauces,  pizzas, tomato sauce and stuff like that, and you have a high deposit those in the system\n\n The raw tomatoes can help pull that garbage out, and that can cause an over acidity in the tongue, the mouth.\n\n\r\nIt can cause temporary geographical tongue.\n\n\r\nFissures all over.\n\n It's called geographical tongue.\n\n Mine's forever that way since they cut the vagus nerve, all the acid comes in my mouth.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Urine & Fasting \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFor this long fast\n\n Cause all along the fast, all I did was drink urine and water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou were just experimenting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n Well, the urine is the same serum as the blood, without the red blood cells and a little ammonia that's manufactured in the kidneys.\n\n So, basically, it's the same thing as blood, very nourishing.\n\n \r\nThere are tribes that don't have much meat, so they recycle their urine every day because they can recycle the proteins and other nutrients in it that they would just swap off by urinating.\n\n  \r\nSo, I learned that in the mid-seventies when I was traveling around on bicycle, but I never had the nerve to try it, until about 1977 when I stopped bicycling, and I found that it did help me because I didn't even eat meat that often and it did recycle my protein and I've done fasts before.\n\n I've done as long as a 32 day fast out on the Colorado river, and I got down to 92 pounds.\n\n I believed that bullshit that Jesus is supposed to have said, if you fast one day for every year that you've lived, you will completely decontaminate your body, which is absolutely horseshit.\n\n \r\nBut I had to find that out the hard way.\n\n You don't remove any toxins from the body, unless you have fat in the body and other nutrients to dissolve it and get it out of the system.\n\n Otherwise, it just recirculates and on a fast your body eats itself, and if you're toxic, you're just eating toxic food and you're not gonna get any stronger.\n\n \r\nSo, maybe you get rid of a couple of trillion unhealthy cells because those cells were weak as hell.\n\n And those cells that are remaining are very weak because you're not feeding them properly.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Vegetable Oils & Plaque \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDoesn't matter\n\n When it's raw, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy doesn't it matter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't matter because there are no side effects from it, there's no disease produced?\n\n All of the tribes that eat lots of it and have very high cholesterol levels have no heart disease and no plaquing.\n\n\r\nPlaquing comes from cooked vegetable oils.\n\n\r\nYou can take a vegetable oil, safflower oil, pour it into dirt.\n\n What will happen.\n\n That dirt will turn into a rock?\n\n Turn into a rock! \r\nIf you take cream or butter and you put it in the dirt, it molds and breaks down and becomes dirt ,feeds numerous bugs and insects and earth creatures.\n\n It's fertilized, but vegetable is not.\n\n\r\nMain thing we use vegetable oil for is to run our cars and machinery.\n\n That's a dinosaur oil, it's an animal oil, but because it's been processed and heated it turns into a solidified substance.\n\n But your vegetable oils are the main reason for hardening of the arteries.\n\n We had very little heart disease and very little congested arteries until the pressed oil industry came out of all this: saturated fats bad, safflower oil was good, corn oil was good.\n\n Once cooked, those will harden the body quickly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Vegetables Make Sick & Weight Loss \n \n**[2003],[Jim]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI'm trying to do the weight loss diet\n\n I got off to a good start, and then I didn't lose any weight, get bloated and regular vegetable juice makes me feel queasy.\n\n So, I'm gonna kind of a rough spot.\n\n So, I think I'm just gonna quit until I get an appetite back.\n\n  \r\nQuit trying to to do the weight loss because I don't even get hungry all day, I just feel bloated.\n\n I don't even want to eat, vegetable juices makes me feel like throwing up.\n\n \r\nI don't know what's wrong.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSounds like you're detoxing.\n\n So, I would change the diet, the weight loss program should be different.\n\n So, you have to give you a call and that would take 15 minutes to get that.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n One other mini question about the weight loss, in your recipe book there's all kinds of great meat recipes and sauces, stroganoff and this and that.\n\n Do those count as meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nSo, in other words, if you get a golf ball sized meat stroganoff, it counts as a golf ball sized.\n\n So, the mushrooms and all that stuff is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRemember, when you're on the weight loss program, you don't want as much fat?\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nBut the recipes in general using butter instead of cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, like I say, if you use those recipes on the weight loss, you're gonna have some difficulty, you're gonna be much hungrier?\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nSo, I should just stick to the meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n Just remember, the more meat you eat, the quicker you will lose the weight.\n\n People start eating juices and do everything else and eat the tomatoes and drink a little milk and then don't eat the meat and they say I'm not losing weight.\n\n Well, hell what do you think burns fat, pyruvate.\n\n \r\nYou got to have the protein, the meat to do it, which is why the Sears diet works.\n\n The zone diet, puts so much meat into the system, it burns all the fat up.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Vegetarian Community In Hawai \n \n \n \n \n### (66) Viruses Aren't Alive \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's not a live thing\n\n It's a conglomeration, a structure of proteins that's not alive, and the medical profession says that viruses are contagious.\n\n  \r\n100 years ago, everybody used to make soaps in their homes with coconut oil and alcohol or coconut oil and vinegar.\n\n That was soap.\n\n Soap was made that way.\n\n That would be like saying, soap is contagious because it appears in every home.\n\n \r\nEverybody's body makes solvents of all compounds, but when your body uses a solvent process, it takes a lot of dilution.\n\n So, instead of reducing the toxic material involved, it expands it like we're washing something, we keep diluting it with water and washing it away, and then you had this bucket of garbage.\n\n \r\nIt's a lot different, when bacteria and parasites eat something, they always reduce the contamination.\n\n Parasites can take three times their weight and reduce it into a hundredth of what it was.\n\n That's why I love parasites because their byproducts are so minimal, easier to handle.\n\n \r\nThey keep dividing cells so that you patch the degenerative areas where the parasites are eating, \r\nBasically, that's it.\n\n So, you don't have to be afraid of your teeth.\n\n Like I said, if you don't want them to rot your face, then put porcelain fillings on them, porcelain fillings last longer.\n\n They don't crack as easily.\n\n They may last 20 years as a composite, which is plastic and is very toxic, can cause recession of gums and of the internal nerve.\n\n Can last a year, two years, three years at the most and is cracking and splitting and turning black.\n\n \r\nSo, these two right here, these are plastic faces on here.\n\n You see them turning black.\n\n So, I've got an option for it, I have them broken out, and I reservice it, and have it taken off and then it has these black teeth remaining.\n\n That's an option that I'm considering right now.\n\n So, I may just have a porcelain face put on it, take the plastic off because it's causing my gums to completely pocket right here.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Vitamic C In Meat \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vitamin C in meat is so high that it reverses severe a scurvy in three days\n\n \r\nNot even carrot juice or oranges can do that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (68) Vitamin D Deficiency, Sun Removes Poison Pigments - Copy \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI like to go in the sun and I have not done anything you've recommended\n\n  \r\nI just go in the sun straight.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, it's very bad.\n\n It's a vitamin d deficiency, they're all in depression.\n\n \r\nThat's why there are so many suicides in Sweden and Finland.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, I've always felt good and regenerated in the sun, and a little down when there's no sun, does that mean I have a vitamin D deficiency.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt means you have a vitamin d deficiency and you need the sun?\n\n \r\nI went through that up until about three years ago.\n\n It took me how many years eating meat on a daily basis, it took me 17 years to get to the point where this kind of weather doesn't depress me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, what I should do is be in in the sun more.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd how much is it okay before it affects me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it depends on what you want?\n\n I'm an opportunist.\n\n I use anything I can to get well quicker.\n\n So, when I lived on a bicycle and wasn't eating meat, my skin felt like leather, like the Indians, and to help get rid of it when I started eating all the meat and raw fat.\n\n \r\nI would scorch myself until I peeled layers of skin off and use natural skin, so I don't have all that scar tissue, and all that thick tissue.\n\n And I still use it, when I've been in Costa Rica.\n\n I had been having the sun for- hardly any sun, raining all the time, but there was one sunny day, so I took full advantage of it.\n\n \r\nSo, anywhere where I had wrinkles that were scar tissue, I've healed, and it's great because now i'm looking younger.\n\n I take full advantage of it, so you can burn yourself if you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n I don't burn very often at all.\n\n I don't, I'm finding some with the marks on my face or I had this thing that started a red mark on my forehead after being in the sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, sometimes what happens is vitamin D helps get rid of poison pigments that are in the body.\n\n Let's say you eat some cake with some food coloring in it and that got into an area- you have to understand, even in the blue, there's coal, it's radioactive minerals in that coloring, so they get into your body and they cause damage, and then your body has to secrete it to get rid of it.\n\n Vitamin D helps take toxic pigments out of the system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo I could go lie in the sun for three hours, correct.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Usually all of those spots, they come out, go away, most of them, on this diet.\n\n Sometimes they may take a year and a half to go away.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about the white spots.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn my laboratory test, I took scrapings on the skin of those white spots cause I had them severely once I started eating all the cream?\n\n I was eating a quart of cream a day with a quart of carrot juice, and I was exercising.\n\n I was eating lots of eggs and lots of fish to build myself up and I had huge white spots all over.\n\n \r\nSo, I took a scraping and I found that those particular cells absorb the vitamin D rapidly, but it could also release it into the body.\n\n Whereas the other skin areas weren't as healthy, they absorb the sun to transform the fats in the skin into vitamin D, that's the process.\n\n \r\nIt takes the sun radiation, use it in the fat to turn it into vitamin D and then release it into the system quickly.\n\n So, those are healthier cells in that area, and the others catch up.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBrown spots, what are those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThose are usually just what they're called, liver spots?\n\n \r\nThey can be the liver, gallbladder, spleen, or pancreas.\n\n The dark glands, when the cells in the glands can no longer produce hormones anymore, they're not functional to the gland.\n\n They're no longer secrete anything but prostaglandins, which are only for the maintenance of the cell itself.\n\n So, the body says, well, you're not any help in the liver and I need to get rid of you because you're taking up space and energy in the liver.\n\n \r\nSo, I'll send you out through the skin where you can function as a barrier.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo they go away after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen they die, a liver cell can live 50 years?\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (69) Water For Athletes & Exercise \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike I said, water dissolves matter\n\n So, then it will leach nutrients out of your body.\n\n When you're exercising, you're producing a lot of lactic acid and a lot of waste products, water's good for that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDrink water when you exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor most people that are exercising heavily, perspiring a lot, unless you've been on the diet, then you don't need to do that?\n\n But when you're young on the diet, water is helpful.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I always have my green juice before I exercise.\n\n I'm wondering how to rotate my water with my exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would say during, and after, not before?\n\n Because you will start leaching your nutrients before you start exercising, you need the water when you begin to exercise.\n\n In my lab tests, in the carbonated water, there was always an increase in nitrogen in the intestines and oxygen in the blood.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) What To Brush Teeth With \n \n \n \n \n### (71) Where Toxins Come Out \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's going to happen, your body discharges poison in every way it can, through the skin mostly\n\n So, the biggest bowel is the skin, so you're all full of shit.\n\n Then the bowel is the next major area, the tear ducts, the ear wax, the gums, the tongue, the salivary gland, your body mostly builds toxic metals into the hair and nails, from the bones, vaginal area, anywhere there's mucus, the penis, urinary tract, wherever the body can discharge poisons, it will.\n\n\r\nAnd because we are so toxic, everything, every part of us is an asshole.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\nSomebody calls you an asshole.\n\n You say, \"I know, thank you\".\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

milking the cows, sucking their teats?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Mom Dried Up After 10 Day \n \n \n \n \n### (3) Acv Per Day \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI would keep it down to a tablespoon\n\n If you're an athlete, heavy exercise, 2.\n\n \r\n2 tablespoons maximum if you're an athlete.\n\n If you're not an athlete, 1 tablespoon maximum.\n\n \r\nIf you're on your feet doing hair all day, two tablespoons you can get away with.\n\n If you're a sedentary worker and you don't do much, one tablespoon a day, maybe only 1.\n\n5 teaspoons a day, which is half a the tablespoon.\n\n\r\nVinegar can be very altering in your system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Add, You Need To Exercise \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSomebody who has ADD, you need to fucking exercise\n\n Anxiety is exercise.\n\n You're producing so many hormones for physical activity, you need to exercise.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Alzheiemrs and Aluminum From Vaccines \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat stage\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's at the point where he'll talk to himself in mirror for an hour and a half?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's not Alzheimer's.\n\n Alzheimer's you can't remember anything.\n\n Delusions, delirium is when you start talking to yourself all the time.\n\n\r\nIf he can't dress himself, he forgets how to dress himself, forgets how to move, forgets how to walk, forgets his address, goes wandering doesn't know where he is.\n\n\r\nSo, he has a little bit of dementia cuz he's talking with himself and he has a little bit of forgetfulness.\n\n So, maybe he's in stage 1 or 2\r\nOn a raw diet with lots of raspberries and coconut cream can get the aluminum out of the brain.\n\n Aluminum causes most Alzheimer's.\n\n\r\nAnd most of that aluminum comes from the canned foods, especially canned beverages, like beer and anything like Coca-Cola that comes in aluminum cans and vaccines and any injection that carries liquid mercury.\n\n So, that's the problem.\n\n \r\nThird and fourth state Alzheimer's this diet will stop, but it does not reverse it.\n\n\r\nBut it makes the body younger and everything else.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Anthrax Only Toxic For 3 Mins \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nPoisons in the gas\n\n There's a specialist on germ warfare that worked on it with the government, he turned on the government 7 years ago and said, \"If you don't inhale the air for three minutes that the anthrax has been released the anthrax is not the deadly part of it.\n\n It's the other properties that keep it airborne and the heavy metals that they use are poisonous.\n\n So, you can cover your mouth you won't be harmed with it, but it's not the anthrax that is the problem.\n\n It's the thing that's carrying the anthrax\".\n\n That's a long subject, we've gone for days.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Anti Biotics, Milkshakes, Papaya, and Cheese \n \n**[2008],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe've discussed that and no antibiotics to be taken before a doctor gives you surgery, even though the doctor wants it\n\n\r\nIn the worst situation, let's say one is conned into taking those antibiotics.\n\n What remedies after the damage has been done.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat do antibiotics do?\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nThey destroy germs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n No, they destroy bacteria.\n\n\r\nThere's no such thing as germs.\n\n That is a word created- that's like the Russians are coming, the enemy's coming, the enemy's coming.\n\n There are no germs.\n\n There is bacteria and bacteria always has their activity.\n\n So, if your main activity is for digesting and healing, you stop digesting and healing.\n\n \r\nMy father went through a stroke in December.\n\n He will only drink the milkshakes when I come to see him.\n\n I got there about 14 days ago and he was in the hospital and they're giving him high doses of antibiotics.\n\n He stopped eating.\n\n Why.\n\n Because the digestive system isn't working?\n\n 90% of your digestive activity is bacteria eating the foods, their waste products is our nutrients.\n\n\r\nSo, you take antibiotics, you've destroyed all of the bacteria that is 90% of your digestion.\n\n So, my father couldn't eat.\n\n He vomited anything you put into him that was cooked.\n\n So, what did I give him.\n\n I gave him a 1/2 cup of papaya every day, and a milkshake?\n\n Got better every time, didn't throw that up at all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMilkshake with eggs and milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEggs and milk, and honey and cream, extra cream?\n\n \r\nPapaya and milkshake.\n\n Cheese to help get rid of some of that antibiotic cause antibiotic sticks around a while.\n\n Don't take it!\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Anti Psychotic Drugs \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYes, absolutely\n\n It causes delusion.\n\n \r\nAny of those drugs, in fact, also the really bad thing about those, all of the high school slayings that went on.\n\n Every one of those children had been taking a psychotropic drug and had stopped taking it for 7 to 14 days before they went on this killing spree, the animal tests given to these psychotropic drugs given to animals in tests?\n\n When they withdrew from those drugs, they killed each other.\n\n Over 50% of the animals turned homicidal.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Asia Tidal Waves Were British Nuclear Explosions \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis is a prediction question\n\n When do you think it will be common knowledge that this is happening.\n\n When do you think people will really get it?\n\n Like about when you're ready to move or you don't know?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot going to happen, the people will never know?\n\n\r\nThey will not let you know.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou won't see all these things changing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're already seeing them.\n\n You're seeing the hurricanes, you're seeing the so-called tsunamis.\n\n Now that tsunami that happened in Asia, that was not a tsunami.\n\n \r\nTsunamis, You have a earthquake underneath, it creates waves, big waves.\n\n\r\nThe only picture you saw of any waves was at, was in Phuket island in Thailand, I was there 12 days before it happened.\n\n The wave, they showed one rock wall.\n\n There's only one rock wall on all of Phuket.\n\n So, when you got a wave coming up, that's the only place where you'll see a wave hit.\n\n That's the only place that they showed.\n\n\r\nBut if you take all of the accounts, the water rose, and came in and down, rose and came in and down.\n\n Only thing that could have caused that is an underground nuclear explosion.\n\n There were two British nuclear submarines and three American submarines in those waters at that time in Indonesia.\n\n And it was a threat from the US and British governments to China and India about their nuclear war.\n\n We're way advanced ahead of them, we can damage them without even declaring war.\n\n \r\nThe reason I believe that was cuz I was on the internet at five o'clock in the morning, and I started seeing these reports coming out, cuz I'd still take a look at the tables and I go to the Navy sites and all of a sudden I saw this site of this island in the midst of the Indian ocean that is owned by the US government.\n\n It's a Naval military base, I forgot the name of it.\n\n Anyway, there was a whole website, they said everybody needs to evacuate the island, cuz there's going to be a flood at a certain hour.\n\n This was 5 hours before the tsunami was supposed to hit.\n\n All of a sudden I went back after the tsunami hit, I went back to copy that website, it had disappeared.\n\n \r\nSo, that was not a tsunami,that was in more bullshit.\n\n That was a created mishap.\n\n And what they were doing is cuz India was starting to make nuclear weapons and starting to make some threats.\n\n China because it's the highest economic power there is now besides the United States and Britain, it was a threat.\n\n Keep them in line and toe, show who's got the balls on the planet.\n\n US and British.\n\n \r\nThe big tyrants of the world are the British government and the American government, the people who run those governments, I should say.\n\n \r\nI just want to keep you politically and geographically in tune with whatever else is going on too.\n\n\r\nI spend too much time studying, I don't have any fun anymore, unless I got to Thailand.\n\n But I'm going to stop that in two years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nStudying or going to Thailand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nStudying?\n\n I'm going to start farming and getting back into life.\n\n Right now I'm all up in my head.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Asians Shouldnt Eat Fruit Unelss Unripe \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI noticed that when I used certain foods, like bananas, orange and carrots, I would wake up feeling my right hand is swollen\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're an Asian eating mainly carbohydrate starches.\n\n You shouldn't be eating fruit, unless it's not ripe, unripe fruit.\n\n You're going to have a greater reaction with sugars.\n\n\r\nSo, keep carrot juice down to a minimum, keep anything high carbohydrate down to a minimum.\n\n Eat cherries, they're not high in carbohydrate, berries are not high in carbohydrate, unripe fruit is not high in carbohydrate.\n\n Eat things that are low in carbohydrate.\n\n If I eat high carbohydrate food my feet swell, my muscle swell, my whole body swells, my thighs swell, everything swells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat causes the swelling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the sugar?\n\n The sugar is looking for fat to burn and digest as fuel.\n\n If it doesn't find it, it goes into your cells, usually your nerve cells and that causes immense swelling cause your body's eating itself for the protein.\n\n And it also demineralizes the body and causes more pain, more agony.\n\n\r\nFruit is a very dangerous thing to eat, unless you're eating lots of fat and lots of meats.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTogether.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well, if you're eating the fruit, you want to eat fat with the fruit to slow it down.\n\n Now that's all explained in the books, reread the books on the carbohydrates.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Autoimmune Is Bvs \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nInflammatory diseases, arthritis\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere is no such thing as an autoimmune.\n\n That is a manufactured bullshit story created by the pharmaceutical and medical community.\n\n \r\nThat's like, okay, the Russians are coming.\n\n I can now go to war.\n\n I can make tanks, bullets, planes, bombs, nuclear weapons.\n\n I can spend all this energy on arming myself, cuz the Russians are gonna take over.\n\n\r\nThat was the reason for the war effort for 30 years, the Russians were coming.\n\n Autoimmune, the body never turns against itself ever, ever, ever turns against itself.\n\n You would never heal if you had that problem, you've got so many poisons in your body that is deteriorating the cells.\n\n\r\nBacteria, parasites, virus, none of them tear the body down and work against you.\n\n You don't fight your own blood, unless it's been poisoned, contaminated.\n\n And then it's not going after the cell because it's a cell because it's you it's going after it because it's contaminated.\n\n Autoimmune, get rid of that.\n\n That is a misnomer.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Best Applie Cider Vinegar \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCleansings and it also removes the heavy mercury and other poisons that dumps through the gums that cause the plaque, and you don't have to rinse your mouth, unless the vinegar, but the vinegar isn't strong enough in that proportion to eat away into the dentine\n\n When you're using raw unpasteurized vinegar that hasn't been aged in stainless steel, has to be either Salona Gold or Brags raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar that's aged in wood.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Bone Marrow Stem Cells For Skin \n \n \n \n \n### (14) Bruises, Ice Vs Heat On Injury \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's if you're not on a good diet, but still, if you put ice on it, you've blocked the increase of circulation and nutrients to that area\n\n You're going to scar.\n\n\r\nWhen you get a damaged area like that, you've got red blood cells that are broken out of their veinous territory.\n\n That's what a bruise is, blood cells that have gotten out of the bloodstream.\n\n That's what a bruise is, red blood cells out of their environment.\n\n If you don't get nutrients in there, like lymphatic flow, neurological flow, excess blood flow in that area, you're not going to clean it out.\n\n It's going to remain in there, harden and scar.\n\n\r\nI don't care what kind of a diet you're on.\n\n So, you can pack ice on it for two minutes to stop the pain, to numb the pain.\n\n Any more than that, you're going to freeze and shrink everything, and you're going to have scar tissue in that area.\n\n \r\nEvery athlete that I worked with does not burn out.\n\n I have one athlete, what's his name.\n\n Tim wall?\n\n Now this guy is already 61 years old.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, he's older than that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd he does 12,500 jump ropes an hour.\n\n Can you imagine that.\n\n When he came to me, he gave me the charts on it?\n\n His heart rate, when he finished within 3 minutes after he finished his heart rate is about 170 to 180, and it was like that every day for almost a whole year.\n\n \r\nAs soon as he started on the diet it decreased.\n\n Within 5 - 6 months on the diet his heart rate was 110.\n\n Went down from 170 to 180.\n\n After one hour of jump rope.\n\n\r\nPeople who get injuries on this diet, if they use ice, you're going to scar.\n\n I don't care what diet you're on.\n\n You use ice only to numb it no more than two minutes.\n\n You put heat on that area, you stay off of it.\n\n You don't get back on the field.\n\n That's for the coach and the team, that's not for your welfare.\n\n\r\nThat's why these athletes burn out in their late thirties, cuz they're so scarred and injured.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Celery Juice Carbs, More Carrot \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDiet is not correct\n\n I have a high celery juice because it extracts sugars out of the body, all the toxic sugars that you've been consuming.\n\n Celery is a negative in carbohydrate, it doesn't have enough carbohydrate to digest itself.\n\n So, celery is a negative, that's why I had it predominant in the juice.\n\n\r\nOnce you've been on the diet for a couple of years, you're all of a sudden gonna be carbohydrate deficient some of you.\n\n Some of you have been really sugarholics that eat tons of sugar, it may take six or seven years for you to get to that point.\n\n \r\nSo, you need to add carrot to the juice, so you'll have more carbs to give you a little bit more energy.\n\n\r\nIf after a juice, you don't feel good, you feel tired.\n\n It's time to adjust, add carrot, anywhere from 20% to 40%, all.\n\n If you're a heavily jaundice person, you have a lot of yellow to your skin, that means you have a lot of bile in the system.\n\n You're already going to be sugar deficient add the carrot juice right away.\n\n\r\nYes.\n\n You'll turn more orange, but it won't be from the carotene, it'll be from the bile.\n\n You're yellow from the bile as it is.\n\n Asians have a lot of bile passing through their system because they eat 80% rice, they don't get enough fat.\n\n So, the body starts sending bile all the way through the system to digest all of the fat that is produced, the acetone that are produced by transforming carbohydrates into acetone, which is a fat.\n\n It's not a very stable fat and it doesn't burn very well in the brain and the nervous system, but in the fuel of the body and the muscles, it's fine.\n\n \r\nIt's good for the lackies and that's the way the Egyptians and the Chinese did it to keep slaves.\n\n They kept them only eating 5% to 10% meat, 80%, rice, and then 10% to 15% vegetables.\n\n That kept their bodies functioning high with their brains functioning low.\n\n So, they were good lackies, they were good slaves.\n\n They could work hard labor without disrupting the futile systems.\n\n So, on this system, it's like 35% to 40% meat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cocontu Cream and Vinegar \n \n \n \n \n### (17) Coconut Cream and Vinegar On Skin \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanna show you an experiment that I've been doing for about a year\n\n It's a little early, I like to use two years.\n\n You see his skin.\n\n Go like this?\n\n You see, it looks like an elephant.\n\n Last year, even when he didn't turn his skin like that, his neck was that way.\n\n So, I have him applying vinegar straight on his neck one night and then coconut cream on another.\n\n He doesn't do it 7 days a week, 3 to 4 days a week.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOh, I'm doing it more often now?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMore often.\n\n And you see the change in the skin.\n\n And how many months have you been doing it?\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nWell, I started last year, but I've been doing it consistently for two months now?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMix it together or separate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSeparate?\n\n Well, one time he has only vinegar on the neck one night, the next night vinegar and coconut cream together.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith like a bandage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, just rubbed on?\n\n Rubbed in a little bit, maybe three minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe facial cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe facial body care cream doesn't do that kind of activity?\n\n It nurtures and builds the neck, instead of taking dead cells away.\n\n The vinegar helps drive dead cells out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs the neck different than the face.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, same thing if you have wrinkles?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you said vinegar one night, vinegar and coconut cream the next.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Like 1 tablespoon of vinegar - 4 to 5 tablespoons of coconut cream.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOh, one time you said you could do them the same night, but five minutes apart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I was experimenting with you, and I've been experiment with myself and other people.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCoconut cream every night is gonna help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut cream every night, as long as there's a little vinegar in it, it's gonna take more of the dead cells away?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI use primal cream every night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat that helps build the skin, but doesn't get rid of scar tissue.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Coconut Cream Perfect Macronutrients Ratios \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCoconut cream has both water soluble and oil soluble vitamins and minerals and enzymes\n\n \r\nCoconut oil only has oil soluble vitamins, and minerals, and doesn't have any protein.\n\n \r\nYour coconut cream has everything in it.\n\n It's a complete food: 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs.\n\n \r\nWhat is the perfect fuel to burn for man to give the greatest amount of energy, and endurance.\n\n\r\n80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate in the citric acid cycle?\n\n And that doesn't come from carbs, it comes from fat.\n\n So, your coconut cream is the most excellent fuel for athletes, or a combination of butter, meats, eggs, anything that'll make 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs before your tournament or your exercise regime, whatever it is\r\nYou'll have more endurance, you'll have more strength.\n\n To get well, that protein level needs to get up to 25% - 35% to recover from your exercise.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you use coconut oil for.\n\n People are going crazy about it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause most people aren't getting a good fat, they're eating lots of vegetable oils, which are garbage, so it helps them.\n\n But after a couple years of filling up on those oils, unless they're athletes, they're gonna have a lot of problems.\n\n Cause they're only getting oil soluble vitamins, and nutrients, but it's helpful for them for a period.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Coconut Oil, Cream and Water, Asians Dont Drink Much Water \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanted to ask you about coconut cream, oil and water\n\n I wanted to ask you what the difference is between or among those three and what benefits.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut milk, also called coconut water is water?\n\n Little bit of extra minerals and nutrients in it, little higher in calcium, but it's basically water.\n\n\r\nIn Asian, women will not drink, but maybe a half a cup of it a day because it causes swelling, causes water retention, it is water.\n\n Asians don't drink water like we do.\n\n You don't see Asians going around drinking water all the time, unless they're the new generation that have been brought up by TV and the school system, which is mainly Western teachings.\n\n\r\nI've dated quite a few Asians and they will only have water with their meals because of the dry rice, but they don't drink water all day long.\n\n\r\nThey eat things with nutrients in them.\n\n They'll eat fruit off the peddlers on the street.\n\n They'll eat fruit, they'll eat vegetables with water in them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Cofee Enema \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThere's your E coli\n\n You want to get depressed.\n\n Do it?\n\n You wanna ruin digestive abilities for your brain and nervous system.\n\n Enema with coffee?\n\n It also sends adrenaline, and caffeine into your whole body, your whole system.\n\n You can take cocaine, it's just as good.\n\n\r\nCoffee enema is just as good and just as damaging as snorting cocaine.\n\n It's just you're damaging the lungs in one area and you're damaging the bowel in the other.\n\n It's very dangerous to do that.\n\n \r\nA lot of the people I know that have made a habit of doing coffee enemas, in their late thirties and forties and fifties, they are constantly depressed.\n\n\r\nThey have to enema every day with that coffee, it's the same as a drug.\n\n I will eat every day cuz I have to eat to survive and to thrive, but I'm certainly not gonna stick coffee up my butt, very unnatural, and that caffeine is a drug.\n\n \r\nIt's not raw coffee, it's not raw caffeine that you're putting up your butt.\n\n\r\nIf you want a raw caffeine, have chocolate.\n\n You can get theobromine, and caffeine all in one lump.\n\n We only have to eat a little bit and it won't get you sick along with, unless you eat too much, it'll demineralize your system.\n\n \r\nAnd a lot of people who do those coffee enemas, guess what they end up.\n\n Osteoporosis, heavily?\n\n Deterioration of their bones.\n\n They start eating their own bones to defend themselves with a heavy mineral need from the caffeine.\n\n \r\nWe're gonna have to move on from that now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo enemas.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo enemas, that just flushes E coli out?\n\n From one enemas it takes 45 - 60 days to replace the E coli, from one enema.\n\n\r\nYou do a colonic, it may take six months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy friend gets headaches, says it resolves his headache.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCertainly it does, but that doesn't make the good way to do it.\n\n I can take cocaine and get rid of a headache.\n\n I can have a broken toe and get rid of a toe ache from taking cocaine, that doesn't make it healthy.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Constipation and High Meat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, he was on the diet on an off, a lot of depression, anxiety, all this stuff, mostly depression, cuz his E coli is bad\n\n Anytime you have depression, you've got a problem with low E coli colonies.\n\n E coli is the final stage of protein and fat digestion, breaks it down to the finitest molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n\r\nIf you don't have good colonies of E coli, you're not going to feed the brain and the nervous system correctly.\n\n So, you're going to find depression and sadness in your life.\n\n You also obviously find constipation cuz the body's trying to hold onto the fecal matter to draw out everything that E coli can break down, and the longer that fecal matter is in there, the deeper the E coli can get into feed on it.\n\n \r\nSo, if you're not constipated where you're getting huge fecal matter that doesn't come out, that's not real constipation.\n\n That's your body just holding the fecal matter up in the colon.\n\n \r\nIf you're having movement so big that it rips your rectum, that's true constipation.\n\n The other constipation is low E coli level, body holding onto your fecal matter.\n\n Then you just need to squirt some, a little mixture of raw butter, raw coconut cream, like 3 tablespoons of each 2- 3 tablespoons of each coconut cream, butter and dairy cream and about 1/4 of a teaspoon honey, mixed in that.\n\n\r\nAnd you take a syringe and squirted up in your rectum.\n\n It'll feed the E coli for 3 to 5 days at a time, so you won't have to hold up the fecal matter so long.\n\n That's the way you can feed it directly.\n\n \r\nYou should just leave it in, do it right before you go to sleep and leave it in cause you want to feed that E coli, you don't want to release it.\n\n You go to sleep with it in you.\n\n \r\nSo, this guy, didn't finish that story.\n\n So, after two years going back and forth with this guy, on and off the diet and his mood swings, I said, listen Tarzan, calls himself Tarzan.\n\n I said, \"You've got to try the high meat.\n\n Just try it one time\".\n\n \"I'm already on this wild diet, it's so antisocial and you want me to eat stinky meat.\n\n\" I said, \"Yeah, if it makes you happy, why not?\n\n Try it\"?\n\n So, he tried it and he didn't call me and report until a week later and he says, \"I'm eating it every day.\n\n I'm only eating high meat from now on\".\n\n So, that's all he eats is high stinky meat, two pounds a day.\n\n You got a bear of a guy.\n\n \r\nThe last time I went and had a workshop where he lived.\n\n Now, this was an antisocial guy that couldn't be funny if he tried.\n\n He is funny, he's hilarious.\n\n He had three, 10 girlfriends at my workshop together, dating all three of them.\n\n\r\nThat's charm.\n\n \r\nSo, the high meat works.\n\n It works for everybody who does it.\n\n Everybody.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Cooekd Meat Every Once In Ahile \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat you think of the idea of eating like a cooked meal every once in a while\n\n Like once a week, once a month, just to kind of keep your immune system kind of stimulated almost, you know what I'm saying?\n\n Like kinda like a good stress almost?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I could make an analogy?\n\n\r\nShoot me with a bullet once a month, so I can stay immune to a bullet.\n\n It's a toxic substance, that doesn't make you immune to it.\n\n Your body already knows how to handle toxicity.\n\n You don't have to eat it to take care of it.\n\n You had what.\n\n 32 years of it?\n\n Your body knows how to handle cooked foods.\n\n It's not gonna forget.\n\n\r\nTakes 40 years to clean the body completely, and in that 40 years, you're not gonna forget.\n\n I've got 12 more years to get my 40 in, I'm still in prison for 12 more years.\n\n  I'm in a delightful prison, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's just that sometimes when  I eat a 100% for like a couple weeks, and then I have just one meal, I get so tired from that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Cause it takes all of your energy and all of your nutrients to deal with those toxins.\n\n And I say to myself, \"Why do I wanna sacrifice 5 - 24 hours of energy for 10 to 15 minutes of a cooked food\".\n\n What logic is that.\n\n For my own logic, it's insanity?\n\n For people who have a taste bud that's so important to them, it's not insanity and I don't judge them for it.\n\n That's their choice, but me, no way I'm sacrificing 5 - 24 hours for 10, 20 minutes of eating a cooked food.\n\n To me that's absolutely insane.\n\n I don't have enough time now.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Cream With Meat, Sour Okay \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVery rarely do I put cream with my meat, unless it's sour cream\n\n Cream coats meat, and makes it very difficult to digest.\n\n Remember cream is the hardest fat to digest, it's the most complex.\n\n It requires almost 60 varieties of cholesterol produced by the liver to digest it, but it makes 30 varieties of cholesterol, the only place that we can make them from is the raw cream to feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n \r\nSo, raw cream is a very important substance to have, but don't have it with your meat, unless you've already soured it, predigested it.\n\n \r\nYou can to a meat meal, you can add sour cream, but mostly eat butter with meat.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, James has the chicken ceviche with cream in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nChicken ceviche is different.\n\n Still it can prevent it from digesting, but you've got lemon juice in there that helps digest the cream, so that's probably okay.\n\n\r\nIf you see the meat come out in your fecal matter kind of pearly, pearlish.\n\n You're not digesting it.\n\n Stop eating cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, would you buy sour cream instead.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSour cream?\n\n Yes?\n\n If you want it with meat, it's fine.\n\n And if you have sour cream with mushrooms and meat, really nice, and then chives.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Diet Meat, Dairy Ratios, and Tribes Cooking Meat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've got about 25% - 30%, dairy in the diet\n\n And then you have your juices, which are about 20% of the diet, in most people's diets, and that's the way that works.\n\n\r\nIn the tribes in Africa dairy averages from 50% - 90% of their diet, raw dairy.\n\n In the Fulani tribe it's 90% - 92% dairy and all of it's fresh.\n\n They just don't eat fermented dairy for some reason, and they cook meat once or twice a month and they cook it in the underground ovens, and they use rocks.\n\n Rocks that they've heated in a fire, and then they put it deeply in the ground, about 5 feet in the ground, sometimes only 4.\n\n5 feet.\n\n\r\nAnd they have these big elephant leaves, so they wrap the butchered animal in the leaves and then put the rocks on the perimeter, so it doesn't get direct heat and probably the hottest it gets in there is about 200 degrees and they'll cook it for 7, 8 hours that way with just the rocks.\n\n And of course they cover the whole thing to keep the heat trapped in it.\n\n\r\nThat tribe is fatter, I mean heavier, stockier than any of the other tribes.\n\n Plus they have patches of skin, but they were up until the British fellow who came in there and brought the agriculture and screwed up their economy and changed the-\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Dogs Diet, Vets, Cooked Diets \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIn a dog and a cat, normally in the wild, that's all a dog eats\n\n They're scavengers to an extent, they'll eat fruit, they'll pick up fruit if they find it.\n\n They'll eat vegetables once in a while, but only when they're starving, aand they can't find anything else, but they are mainly meat, dogs and cats.\n\n\r\nSo, when they get a high protein level, especially when it's raw, domesticated dogs, they start eliminating the aluminum, formeldahyde, and mercury that they get in injections.\n\n And when the dog and a cat get injections, they don't get it for their size.\n\n They get the full dose if it's a small dog or big dog, unless you've got a conscious veterinarian.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShots, which they do by law, and then I never took 'em for anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's already 8 shots.\n\n Puppies get eight shots by the 10th week.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is it never gonna go down or will it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it usually takes by their ninth year it's all gone nice year?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's a year and a half now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, he may get dump all of it early if he's dumping it all now, how wonderful.\n\n \r\nSee, most dogs and cats will go into paralysis between their seventh and ninth year.\n\n Whole back end goes into paralysis, usually everything falls.\n\n I have many people call me and say my dog or my cat's completely paralyzed, they're dragging their back end.\n\n They won't eat, they won't do anything.\n\n And I said, you just have to see this through, sometimes if you have to squirt some milk down, fine, get cheese down, then mash it up with some yogurt, get the cheese down, absorb that stuff, so we can get it out quicker.\n\n And it usually takes five to six months for that cycle, then they're back to normal.\n\n And you wonder, how could they be crippled.\n\n\r\nLet me give you an example.\n\n I went to see a friend of mine who had been my publicity agent at MGM when I was an actor in doing a medical center TV show with Chad James daily, and he had five dogs and he had a pug that I had known.\n\n I got off to live off of a bicycle, and I travelled all around, then I came back.\n\n \r\nThis was in the early to mid eighties, and he had a pug that I knew ever since he got it.\n\n So, this pug was 14.\n\n5 years old: cataracts, completely blind, deaf, couldn't bark, paralyzed, couldn't wobble more than a few feet and collapse, couldn't even go to the toilet on its own.\n\n\r\nDory would take him outside and rub him so he could even pee.\n\n So, I put him on a raw diet, in six months the dog could see halfway, half the cataracts were gone, jumping on and off the couch, going out the doggy door on his own.\n\n Never had any more paralysis symptoms.\n\n\r\nThat's how quickly a dog will react.\n\n We've been on cooked foods for 10,000 years, unless you're African American.\n\n They've only been on it for 400 years.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThat's why they're such athletes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's why they're much better than most whities overall.\n\n Proportionately, the intensity of African Americans are much more athletic than Caucasians because they've been raw longer and some of them can even suffer through a cooked diet better than we can, but some of them are even worse at a cooked diet.\n\n You see how obese they can get, just to preserve their body.\n\n So, you collect tremendous amounts of fat and the molecules get 50 times their normal size of fat molecules.\n\n\r\nSo, everything is proportionately huge in a lot of African Americans, they're trying to adjust to this processed diet.\n\n So anyway, the dog, cheese, lots of cheese to help absorb these toxins.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCheese's okay for a cat too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould a dog need cheese with butter too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, dog doesn't need, if they're having diarrhea, they don't need butter?\n\n They need the cheese to absorb the garbage.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Eggs For Emphysema \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSomebody was saying you have lecithin\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBullshit.\n\n Absolute bullshit.\n\n Take a look at the woman with emphysema that I talk about in my recipe book.\n\n Emphysema for seven years, her MD said she was gonna die that weekend, she'd been on machines for two years, bedridden for almost two years.\n\n\r\nAnd her MD called me and said, \"What can I do\".\n\n And I said, \"Well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you?\n\n\" And she said, \"Well, in the medical profession, you cannot give alternatives, until the medical therapies have failed for 10 years\"?\n\n It's only been seven years for her, so she could lose her license by recommending another therapy, but she cared about her patient.\n\n\r\nSo, that's why she called me.\n\n That's when I found out it is a law that a MD can only give you medical therapy for 10 years.\n\n If it fails for 10 years, they can offer you alternative therapies.\n\n \r\nSo, you're doomed to medical waste for 10 years, medical destruction and they have the oath do no harm.\n\n Who's bullshit is that.\n\n Not one of them live by it?\n\n\r\nSo, this woman ate 33 eggs a day at my recommendation.\n\n I said, get that woman 10 - 15 dozen eggs, put 'em on her bedside and to eat as many eggs as she can in as little time as she can.\n\n \r\nI got a call on Monday morning from this raspy voice woman and said, \"It worked, what else do I do\".\n\n\r\n\"Who are you?\n\n\",  she said, \"Well, my doctor called you and you recommended I eat as many eggs as I could?\n\n So, I ate 33 on Saturday, 33 on Sunday.\n\n I'm off the machines, I'm out of bed.\n\n What else can I do\".\n\n Keep eating the eggs?\n\n Because her body can spend all the time cleansing and healing with those eggs, cuz she's not spending all the time in digestion.\n\n\r\nShe's already in a serious state when you have emphysema.\n\n So, she needs to spend all of her time cleansing and healing, not digesting.\n\n So, I had her eat that for about six months, eggs and eggs and eggs, no biotin deficiency.\n\n She got well.\n\n It's absolute bullshit, it makes me angry.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Famines and Food Shortages \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMost people are accumulating beans and grains and other things\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo you wanna be around them when they're passing gas.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, no?\n\n Let's say, how would a Primal Dieter if he did have some concern of a food shortage, possible famine, what would a Primal Dieter do in a famine or a food shortage and how would they prepare for it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n The way I did and the way I'm still prepared, I have deer meat thatt's floating in either coconut oil or olive oil, completely preserved.\n\n I did it in the year 2000, and that meat is still as fresh and as clean, and I can just pull it out and eat it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIn the fridge.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, not in the fridge?\n\n I have it in the lower cupboard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA couple weeks worth or what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, let's say rationing it a half a pound a day, minimum?\n\n You're gonna be thinner, and if you're rationing, you're going to be thinner.\n\n\r\nSo, you're doing half a pound a day.\n\n I put 'em in gallon jars and two quart jars, half gallon jars, and it's floating in there.\n\n But let me tell you, there's very little oil compared to the amount of meat.\n\n So, I've got a week's worth of meat in a gallon jar.\n\n So, if I have three of those and three half gallons, I've got a good supply of meat for a long time.\n\n Unrefrigerated.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's high meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it doesn't?\n\n It doesn't get high.\n\n The fat oil seals it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust soak it in oil, coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat I did was I put layers of strips of meat around in a jar, pulled the oil in till it got on top, then I put more meat in and around, then I put more oil in just so it coated everything, but it's not a lot of oil in there?\n\n Just enough to seal everything, seal the air out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOlive oil, you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOlive oil and coconut oil is what I use?\n\n \r\nNo, you need it to cover it.\n\n You can't have air in the jar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe oil won't go rancid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOlive oil doesn't go rancid?\n\n Coconut oil doesn't go rancid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that's the extent of your food preparation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I have jars of honey, gallons of jars of honey?\n\n Butter, I always keep an extra eight pounds in my refrigerator cuz you never know what could happen.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you got maybe a couple months worth of food.\n\n Whereas these people with the beans and the rice could conceivably have a couple years worth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd then go out and eat a couple of people every day to get their to get their meat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut would you go to like beans and rice if you got to that point.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNever?\n\n\r\nI would never get to that point, I'd be out hunting and growing creatures quickly.\n\n\r\nThese squirrels would not be my friends anymore, they would be my herd.\n\n I would have them in cages I build down there and I've got the cage ready.\n\n And the coyotes, I would be shooting because I already tried to raise chickens here and they got inside the coop and everything.\n\n It went right through that screen door.\n\n You can see it ripped and got one of my chickens right up against my screen door while I was sitting right there.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Fermented Coconut Cream \n \n \n \n \n### (29) Fibermyalgia Is Uric Acid and Mienral Crystals \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhy are the muscles so tense and hard\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat you have is you have chemical compositions that have collected in the muscles and in the joints: uric acid, lactic acid, mineral crystals, and they collect in the body and they cause cutting?\n\n They slice the veins, the nerves, the muscles, everything, all the tissue that's in there.\n\n They actually cut, cause soreness and bruising, internal bleeding, very microscopic level, but it happens all over.\n\n \r\nVinegar is very helpful to dissolve those compounds, whey helps remove it also.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDrinking it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, goat whey, milk whey?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut not when they process it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, it's gotta be the raw stuff?\n\n\r\nAnd that causes soreness all over.\n\n I had fibromyalgia from the age of 2.\n\n5, all the way up till about 7 years on raw diet.\n\n When I started eating a lot of raw meat, milk, and eggs most of my Fibromyalgia, I would say 80% of it went into remission.\n\n\r\nTo get up out of bed as a child, to get up out of my desk at school, it was a major effort because I was just sore and stiff all over.\n\n I was like an old man as a boy.\n\n Now I'm like a boy as an old man, I like that.\n\n But it was work.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Figners Peeling Away Collegan Deficiency, How To Get \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's a collagen deficiency\n\n On this diet we don't eat much fruit because it's sweet.\n\n Watermelon is one of the higher fruits in collagen.\n\n It's is most concentrated in the rind, one inch up.\n\n I cut away all the ripe stuff that's high sweet and toss it, and I give it to the Ravens and that's what they've been getting every day at this time.\n\n\r\nSo, you can hear them squawking, sugared out and crazy.\n\n And once I give it to them, they're really nuts, they go flying all around.\n\n They really get like monkeys on high fruit, they get very hyperactive.\n\n \r\nI don't want to get that way, so I eat the rind and a little bit of the pink and that's what I eat of the melon.\n\n\r\nBut the way I compensated that is cucumber has a lot of collagen precursors, so you eat cucumber.\n\n Now, like I say, in vegetable juices, predominantly you should have about 30% - 40% cucumber in your juice, but it's cucumber puree.\n\n You peel the cucumber and you blend it with the juices that you're making and you blend it all together and then drink it.\n\n\r\nSo, you chew your juice that way you get the collagen that you need.\n\n As long as you're eating the raw fats, like butter, your nails won't peel back as long as they're getting collagen, and it takes about two months to correct it.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nIs the squash a substitute.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo squash doesn't have the same ability?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Food Irradiation \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a question in regards to the radiation of the vegetables now that started today\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnly two vegetables and they're than the mainstream.\n\n They're not gonna go to the health food stores, that goes into the regular supermarkets.\n\n Are you buying food from the regular supermarket.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, no, no, no, no?\n\n I'm just was wondering is it only spinach and lettuce.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's only spinach and lettuce right now?\n\n\r\nIt's almost all papayas that enters this country are irradiated.\n\n If you see a papaya shriveled and burned on one side, they've been irradiated.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, where do you buy your papayas then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you just have to look for organic and look at them and make sure they're organic and not irradiated?\n\n\r\nSo, you look for shriveled side with a burn, just on one part of that papaya.\n\n If you see that on the papaya, it's been irradiated and that's the way you have to look for it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou didn't say avocados.\n\n Just those three.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut they've been doing potatoes for 25 years?\n\n They've been increasingly and they let you know a little at a time.\n\n\r\nIf you're not shopping at a supermarket, you're going to be okay.\n\n If you're shopping for vegetables and fruit at a regular supermarket, you're risking irradiated food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhole Foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhole Foods, not yet?\n\n Nothing they buy is irradiated, those companies aren't big enough to have those irradiated.\n\n Radiating your food is very complex and complicated and expensive.\n\n\r\nSo, it's only these big conglomerates like Krogers, A&P, Ralphs, supermarkets like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do they do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it so called kills bacteria, has a longer shelf life?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd also it brings our health down.\n\n It's not giving any nutrients.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Fungus \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nChemicals that are stored in the connective tissue, perspire them out and you don't need the fungus\n\n \r\nAnd let me tell you this again, fungus eat the poisons that are in the connective tissue, organic waste.\n\n When it breaks them down, it's a very acid compound that dries out the skin and causes itching and rashes.\n\n\r\nIf you're using a hot bath with that formula, you can perspire it out, so you don't have to have a fungus breaking it down into a smaller complex to get it out through the skin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Get Put Nder Instead Of Novocaine \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI think you should get any mercury that you have implanted to make sure it's out\n\n That's the only surgery I would do.\n\n\r\nNo Novocain, be put out.\n\n\r\nCuz that'll harden in the body, and the face.\n\n Very hard to detox Novocain and it goes right into the brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut the drugs you use to get put under don't harm you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, cuz they stay systemic?\n\n They stay flowing in the blood, in the neurological system.\n\n They aren't injected into the tissue where they collect in patches, pockets.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, to pull out more of the mercury or the Novacain that might be in my tissues, what would I do for food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't do it?\n\n Just let your body do it on its own when it wants to.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust do my regular, what I've been doing.\n\n I have noticed when I've been eating the bone marrow, this tightens up a lot.\n\n It tightens up a whole lot, it's almost like it's I have a whole new sheath going on in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And what you can take it is some of that bone marrow and just shove it up your gum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, that's good.\n\n Does that work for receding gumline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n You can heal you're receding gums too by a mixture of a tablespoon of coconut cream, about 3/4 of a teaspoon of vinegar and a teaspoon of Terramin clay.\n\n Mix those together and brush your teeth with it.\n\n\r\nAnd I recommend that you use an infant's toothbrush, very soft, very small, and you can work some of that up into your gums, that will clean all the plaque away.\n\n\r\nRecipe:\r\n1 tablespoon of coconut cream\r\n3/4 teaspoon of vinegar\r\n1 teaspoon Terramin clay\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Global Warming, Astronomy, and Poles

\n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs that what our shit and our piss are\n\n Is that like our food supply?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow, if you were a completely raw fooder all of your life, fecal matter and urination is never a discard of waste?\n\n It's just byproducts being released, undigested food, completely undigested being released.\n\n \r\nIt's like in Georgia, Russia, in some areas of Thailand and Asia, they eat the fecal matter from the water buffalos.\n\n Why.\n\n Because it's predigested to the point where we can digest it, so they can get a lot of protein and fat from it?\n\n \r\nA lot of other beetles and insects also eat fecal matter because they can get nourished by it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you wouldn't want to eat your fecal matter if you hadn't been raw for a while.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wouldn't want to?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) High Meat Hikin \n \n**[2008],[Jim]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLet me just say, Barbara's been 100% on the primal diet for two years, and if we go somewhere, we just bring our own food\n\n Nobody argues.\n\n They understand.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI just wonder two things and that is for hiking, high meat would be good, I guess.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n You couldn't get more energy.\n\n \r\nI went on a hike with somebody with nothing but high meat for 7 days.\n\n We giggled and had fun the whole way.\n\n Everything with the environment, the trees were alive, everything pulsated more because we had more nerve cells alive in feeding them on eating high meat all day.\n\n\r\nWe were in Hawaii and then she ate some fermented guavas, then she turned a little nuts.\n\n Got a little extreme, a little too sexual in front of other people and stuff like that.\n\n  \r\nSo, don't eat highly fermented guavas along the way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you eat high ground meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I find that sometimes causes nausea?\n\n When the meat is ground with the fat, sometimes it will cause massive detoxification of the liver or pancreas.\n\n So, it's not as good to eat high meat that's ground.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Hiking, What To Bring \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe wanna go backpacking for 2 days\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSierras?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Not so hot.\n\n I didn't know if you're going down to the Andes.\n\n Sierras aren't that hot, so the oxygen level's gonna be okay.\n\n \r\nWhen I went hiking in Hawaii, I backpacked and hiked all of the island all, the way down to green sands They actually have black/green sand, and that's the lowest point in America south and I hiked there all the way up to YPO valley.\n\n \r\nSo, what I took was, I had a, uh, one of those one and a half liter Lexan containers with 2/3 butter and 1/3 honey, even when it got fermented near my 10th day of hiking backpacking, and even though it was fermented, it was perfect.\n\n And whenever I came to a store I had meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if we were to go out 10 days without having a resupply, like if we just had to carry with us for 10 days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I say, butter and honey is your best thing to take?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's your main food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I'd still take some cheese?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo,  for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks on the trail, everything you say just butter, honey and cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou could take nuts, seeds?\n\n Seeds are a little bit better.\n\n Pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds are good nutrients, but you have to eat them with the honey and butter, and I would take an egg, at least one egg a day.\n\n\r\nSo.\n\n let's say you're going 10 days, that's at least 10 eggs for each person make juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe can't really make juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you don't eat juice.\n\n You're gonna have to drink water here and there where you can find it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're not recommending meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if they'll eat high meat, that's great?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you eat high meat the whole time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, absolutely?\n\n I have one guy that eats two pounds of high meat a day.\n\n He doesn't eat any fresh.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Hot Baths and Why To Take Short Baths \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the long lymphatic baths\n\n The short 35 and that's in addition to the book.\n\n \r\nWhen I found that a lot of people were dissolving the lymphatic congestion and the lymph system dumps its dissolved fats and toxins into the connective tissue and skin to be perspired out.\n\n\r\nI found that some people who were taking the hot baths went through that process, but they didn't get it out of their skin.\n\n So, about 20% of the people I found needed to do 35 minute baths every day that they weren't doing the hour to an hour and a half baths, lymphatic baths that's to get it out the connective tissue.\n\n\r\nSo, add a 35 minute bath up to five days a week.\n\n So, 2 long lymphatic baths, and then,  5 x 35 minute connective tissue flush.\n\n \r\nNo.\n\n\r\nOne does not need to exercise after the short bath.\n\n The long bath, yes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you take a hot shower.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't do the same?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSteam sauna.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, steam burns the mucus membranes and the lung, damages mucus production, damages those mucus membranes?\n\n Causes dryness in the mucus membranes and lungs.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to get into a jacuzzi, a hot tub, something like that that's not chlorinated.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) How Much Egg White In Eyes \n \n \n \n \n### (41) How Much Water Per Day \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWater is a solvent\n\n When it rains it dissolves rock in the ground, plants eat.\n\n When we drink water, it starts fractionating everything, not as bad as salt and not as bad as cooking, but it starts breaking down the bacteria in the intestines, it dehydrates, it, it dries it out.\n\n It thins the mucus, it dries the mucus.\n\n\r\nSo, the whole intestinal tract stops working well.\n\n So, you become more dehydrated because the water, naturally H2O when it's utilized by a cell is ionically bound.\n\n Drinking water, there's no ion activity.\n\n \r\nThese people like Gatorade said, \"We're full of electrolytes.\n\n We've got everything bound, can be absorbed.\n\n\" With what.\n\n When you have 93 to 117 nutrients with H2O coupled with it in a proper balance absorbing it, that's the perfect balance?\n\n Drinking water with synthesized electrolytes is not a healthy process.\n\n You're just gonna fill a cell with water that it can't use properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThis stuff too.\n\n Even these mineral waters?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven that?\n\n \r\nThat's why I say everybody because they've been eating cooked foods all their lives needs anywhere from a 1/2 -3/4 cup of water a day in little sips.\n\n I don't anymore.\n\n I can get away with a 1/2 cup a month, and that's about all the water I drink.\n\n\r\nBut I used to keep it down to 3/4 of cup a day and that's what I needed.\n\n\r\nWell, milk is 82% water, meat is 55% water, but it's all electrolyte and ionically bound.\n\n You can absorb and utilize every bit of it without causing a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the green juice too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe green juice is 92% water?\n\n Perfect, and it's got lots of ions in it.\n\n It doesn't have the protein in, it has some fat, doesn't have the protein in it, so if you get heart palpitations after drinking your first juice, you put an egg in that first juice in the day, but mostly you can eat the vegetable juice without the egg in it to help move things that weren't moving because of all the cooked foods that you've eaten and it supplies your body with lots of enzymes to get ready for digestion.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) How To Eat With Relative \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEat mine raw, I don't have a problem\n\n And with my relatives, I just say, I'm allergic.\n\n You say allergies, and nobody wants to be all responsible for allergic reaction.\n\n And my grandmother who was Jewish, me eating butter with meat or dairy with meat, that was unheard of.\n\n You have separate plates that you eat and you never have 'em at the same meal, but I was driving them crazy, eating everything raw, full of bacteria and all of that.\n\n \r\nAnd then being un-kosher at the same time.\n\n And I said, \"Grandma, I have allergies\".\n\n Her religion went right out the window and she says, \"Okay, if it's for your health, you do what you have to do\".\n\n And even the rabbi that was there he said, \"If it's medicinal and it works, you do it\".\n\n\r\nSo, I got dispensation.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) How To Get Retirement Money Out and Where Ajjonus Is Moving \n \n \n \n \n### (44) Hummus Is Garbage \n \n**[2008],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAt James they sell that hummus, but it has some sprouting in it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHummus is garbage.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nNo, I mean, it's raw everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't care, it's garbage.\n\n It's made from chickpeas chickpeas, germinated chickpeas.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow about if she uses carrots, instead of the chickpeas to make hummus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo make hummus?\n\n It's not hummus?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI know, but it says she could make it with just carrots, ground very small.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know.\n\n I've done no experiments with anything like that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nif you don't use a chickpeas and just carrots.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the chickpeas, you have to understand any bean or grain that's been germinated has three other enzymes that act like phytic acid that prevent mineral absorption, that will prevent proper protein digestion and then proper fat digestion?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI know, but she wouldn't use a chickpeas.\n\n She has carrots instead.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know, carrots are a vegetable.\n\n If you're using vegetable fiber, you're not going to digest it, unless you're fermenting it.\n\n \r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Kidney Stones Collections Of Heavy Metasl ,salt, Cooked Food Cause Aging \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the kidney problems are from kidney stones that means collection of heavy metals in the kidney\n\n And what happens the minerals that cause that kind of magnetic polarity, usually it starts off with little crystals and they'll sometimes make little rice shaped objects.\n\n And then as they attract together, they'll build into a larger stone.\n\n \r\nWhat causes this is when you eat cooked food, you fractionate all the ionic bonds, so all the electrolytes and everything are disturbed.\n\n When you normally eat raw food you have conglomerative nutrients after everything passes through the intestinal attack tract and it's absorbed into the lymphatic system and into the lacteal system that leads to the lymphatic system.\n\n \r\nIt breaks the nutrients down and categorizes them into smorgasbords, so you have 93 to 117 nutrients in one group, and it's microscopic.\n\n And when the cell opens up, it gets a whole smorgasbord of nutrients.\n\n If you cook your foods, you fractionate that, if you eat salt, you fractionate that.\n\n So, each cell, when it eats, it may be getting 20, 32 nutrients, maximum 50 nutrients.\n\n\r\nEvery cell is being is getting deficiencies, every cell in your body is full of deficiencies.\n\n No wonder we only live half the age that other creatures live.\n\n Other creatures live 7 times the time it takes them to finish maturation, we should be living to 147 years old.\n\n If we made finished maturation at 21 years old, 147 years old, we're averaging 70 years.\n\n\r\nThat's half of what we're supposed to live.\n\n Why is that.\n\n Because every cell is getting deficient every time you eat cooked?\n\n foods.\n\n \r\nEvery time you eat salt, even if you're eating raw food, you eat salt, it causes a fractionation of those smorgasbords of nutrients.\n\n It breaks them up.\n\n\r\nSo, in that process of cooking where you have fractionated all those bonds, you have a lot of free radicals that are created.\n\n Free radicals are minerals that can be toxic when they're isolated and on their own: mercury, thallium, lead, zinc.\n\n Any of those metallic minerals become free radical, damage minerals.\n\n When they're in ionic and electrolyte bonds, it's all a uniform package that makes beneficial changes in the system, energy structure, everything.\n\n \r\nWhen they're separated and free radical, they do damage.\n\n So, if they collect in the intestines, you'll form crystals in the intestines.\n\n That usually gets washed through the kidneys.\n\n When they collect in the kidneys, you'll have stones.\n\n\r\nTo keep from creating stones, vinegar is your best bet, raw and pasteurized apple cider vinegar.\n\n It helps break those up and dissolve them.\n\n Now, Lewis here came to me with a bladder stone problem, and when he had an ultrasound done, it showed lots of little particles, mineral crystals all around the one stone.\n\n\r\nSo, I gave him a flush of about half a cup of vinegar, half a cup of honey, and a couple of cups of sparkling mineral water, and about a half a cup of coconut cream mixed together.\n\n \r\nNow, what it did was flushed off all those little crystals that were all around, which were gonna make that stone twice as big.\n\n\r\nSo, when he had the sonogram done, those were all gone.\n\n But when the magnetic force gets into a hard, large crystal or a stone, it's like a magnet, you can't pull it apart with anything natural.\n\n So, you've gotta go in and laser blast it or sonogram blast it out of the system.\n\n \r\nThe stone is so magnetically forced together that there's no nutrient that I found or combination of nutrients that can break it down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, do you recommend the laser.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, the laser to blast it to pieces?\n\n \r\nNow I started growing a stone when I was 3 years old and it grew until I was 59 years old.\n\n It was the biggest stone they'd ever seen.\n\n It was this long and this big around, nobody had ever seen a stone stone that big.\n\n The urologist that I went to said, \"Oh, normally it takes 5 to 10 minutes to break a stone down.\n\n That's the biggest I've ever seen.\n\n It's gonna probably take me 45 minutes\".\n\n\r\nTook him an hour and 45 minutes to blast that stone to pieces because when he got to the core of it, guess what it was.\n\n It was mercury from all of the vaccines and the tetanus shots that I had had had collected, and they hardened into a whole magnetic core and he couldn't break it up?\n\n He just kept blasting and blasting blasting.\n\n\r\nThey have a laser beam.\n\n I mean, if he misses, it cuts right through the bladder.\n\n So, he has gotta be very careful.\n\n So, the nurses says he was dripping wet dealing with that stone that I had had.\n\n Cause that's 5x larger than any stone they've ever seen, but it caused me problems from the day that I can remember.\n\n\r\nI thought that I just had a deformed urethra that was very small because from time I can remember, it took me 2.\n\n5 - 3 minutes to start peeing and then a good two minutes to finish peeing.\n\n My mother used to slap me on the shoulder and back and say, \"Hurry up.\n\n Nobody else takes this long to pee\", but I had a stone in there at that age.\n\n \r\nSo, it had gone all the way up to 59 years old, and then I started having trouble peeing, unless I acted like a dog.\n\n So, I lifted my leg like this, the stone would shift over, so I could pee.\n\n Going into a toilet somewhere where I had to lift my leg here, had him come out here and lift my leg.\n\n So, I copied with the coyotes, becoming a dog.\n\n\r\nAnd then one weekend, I went probably six months like that trying the vinegar to break it down, then it became very painful and at the head of the penis and the urethra where all the pain was, yet the stone was up in the bladder, but all the pain was down here.\n\n\r\nSo, it started on a Friday night.\n\n I didn't get to urologist until Monday morning, and let me tell you, I had a Monday morning cuz I was in pain.\n\n I mean, I kept the pain down with my pain formulas and all, but if I didn't keep on the pain formula every 5 hours, I was in excruciating pain.\n\n\r\nSo, I went to the urologist, he did the test, he did the ultrasound on there and saw this big, huge stone.\n\n And I have pictures of it cuz they put a scope up me when they went to blast it, and it's this gnarly, lumpy looking huge mass.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSometimes you have to use a doctor.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, so I went up there and he blasted it to pieces and I've been peeing like a horse ever since, I can pee in seconds and finish in a half a minute?\n\n\r\nGreat when I've spent my whole life taking 3 - 5 minutes to pee.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) La Water and Water Tank To Claen It \n \n**[2008],[Fred],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause you've said that LA water's got something like 170 chemicals-\r\n\n\r\n192 chemicals\n\n\r\nWe're the highest in the world.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nBecause of that I'm looking at making sort of like a tank that's got clay on the bottom of it, cuz I wash my celery, I wash my dishes, wash my hands.\n\n Would that help if I run water into this tank where it's stored and it's got the clay in it to absorb the crap, then I use that for washing and stuff like that.\n\n\r\nWould that actually help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I would say you put some coconut cream, as well as clay in it, it will be okay?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nLike what percentage you think it would remove roughly.\n\n Would it remove half of the chemicals?\n\n Most of them?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou mean in the water?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on how much clay.\n\n Let's say you had a 10 gallon tank and you put a cup of clay in there and half a cup of coconut cream, that would arrest all the poisons in that water?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, really.\n\n \r\nAnd f it doesn't have a top, will the chlorine vapors, will they come off too?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they're already arrested and transformed by the clay and the coconut cream?\n\n\r\nOh, and also two tablespoons of vinegar.\n\n Forgot about that.\n\n It will break down the chlorine quickly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's basically the same thing you put in a bath only bigger.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, except without the milk?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Man Ruined Fulani Tribe \n

channel and look up the Fulani tribe, and you can probably find that film and he admits that he ruined the tribe.\n\n Completely ruined it.\n\n\r\nBecause now they fight.\n\n Before when they used to have little quarrels, the children would mock them and they ceremony in the evening.\n\n So, everybody would laugh about the silly antics of the argument.\n\n \r\nNow they get in fights, they're killing each other.\n\n They're fighting, it's causing all this trouble and this British man regrets every minute of the time that he taught them to be civilized.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Masai \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd brought machines and agricultural to them to put their more on grains and all the garbage that they didn't normally eat\n\n Now they're eating lots of fruit, which they didn't eat much of, and so they get more emotional and many more problems.\n\n That's the Fulani tribe.\n\n \r\nThe Maasai tribe was 60% - 70% dairy, about 35% meat and a little bit of vegetables.\n\n It was against the law in the Maasai tribe to eat fruit cause they're the tallest skinniest tribe in the world, yet they're the fiercest strongest and best fighters in the world.\n\n The tallest guy is like 9 foot something, I've met several of them.\n\n**[health food store]**\n in the late seventies.\n\n He walked through the door, he couldn't walk through the door.\n\n He went under the door to come in, he was 7' 6''.\n\n So, we had all these plants hanging from the ceilings between the rows of food, and we used to have to have one of the workers there, one of the employees climb up on a ladder, take them down, take them back to the sink in the back and water them once a week.\n\n So, I hired him to take them down by hand, it was very easy.\n\n It became a one hour job, instead of an all day job, soit was very convenient.\n\n\r\nGreat guy.\n\n He played the creature, the alien in that Arnold Schwarzenegger picture.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou mean The Predator.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe predator?\n\n He played the predator in that.\n\n Of course, you couldn't see him.\n\n  \r\nSo, they are now ruined.\n\n There's a drought over there for 6 years now, so the Masaai tribe, their wealth was based on cows.\n\n How much milk they could produce and how much meat they could produce to feed all the Masaai tribe.\n\n The 6 year drought now has destroyed 80% of their herds.\n\n So, they're now accepting care packages and you know what care packages are.\n\n Kelloggs reject stuff from their factories that they can sell to these-\r\n.\n \n \n

schlacke metal?\n\n You have to go to James and tell him, I can't because he doesn't listen to jar is okay.\n\n \r\nThe glass jar is great, it's the lid that's the problem.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOh, so

regenerate cells that are already alive with eggs and milk, but you cannot cause rapid cellular division like a child does, unless you're eating raw meats\n\n That's the only way I found in my tests with 2300 people, the only way I got growth hormones to reappear in adults was with raw meat.\n\n\r\nEven if the raw milk is fresh and warm, it only increases at maybe 10%.\n\n 10% is good, but then who has a cow who sucking the milk out of a cow right away.\n\n As soon as you refrigerate it, it's lost?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou want the fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, the growth hormone potential?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if you take it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA cow's body temperature is 101° - 105°?\n\n So, when it cools down to room temperatures, 78° is still a lower portion, but still higher than if you refrigerate it.\n\n So, when I get milk fresh from a cow, I never refrigerate it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, once you're refrigerate it, you pretty much have killed its potential for growth hormones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo increase growth hormones to rapid?\n\n\r\nIt still will encourages a normal healing growth rate, but that's still slow compared to a child where it's very rapid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould there be a maximum amount on the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can eat as much as you like, until you can't eat anymore?\n\n Cause usually if I eat 3 bone marrows a day, let's say they're an inch and a half thick.\n\n I can't even eat 2 a day.\n\n If I go a long period, like I'm an Asia, and I don't get a lot of milk, I can eat 6 a day for 2 days and then I can only eat 2 - 3 a day again.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Need To Keep Adjusting Diet \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm gonna start off with this time is there's a lot of people who think that the Primal Diet is a stagnant diet and when people have been on it for a few years, they stop having as good reactions\n\n Why.\n\n Because they're not adjusting?\n\n If you read my book once a year, you're going to see that when you have changes in your body, those are the foods you need to adapt to.\n\n \r\nThe diet that I will prescribe to you when you come to me is for your normal course.\n\n If you start having detoxifying symptoms, you go to the book.\n\n Those are the foods you eat during those times.\n\n You either add those foods to the diet that I've given to you and eliminate something on the diet that I've given you, or you eat completely if I've addressed a complete diet in the books to have for those kind of detoxifications.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n###

there's pain everywhere and it just comes out of nowhere.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCould be mercury, could be Thallium, could be formaldehyde, something from a vaccine or a medication, or she has lactic acid build up in her system.\n\n\r\nThen all she has to do is move her muscles.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, she just recently got diagnosed with fibromyalgia.\n\n Do you think there's a connection between the two.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFibromyalgia is always heavy toxins stored throughout the body?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat would make sense.\n\n And so the diet that you talked about in your book is something that can help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n But the addition, like I talked about earlier,  did you come late.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I talked about the vinegar, helping break that stuff down when you have it with the sport drink and also with the vegetable juice.\n\n And that helps dissolve that, also whey.\n\n Helps remove it.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Novacain Detox \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe dental surgeon said\" You've got a hose of nerves that go all the way along and the teeth attached to them\n\n The nerve of the tooth attaches to that hose.\n\n Once you split that hose, it can never mend.\n\n And those teeth will rot outta your mouth.\n\n You'll never have feeling again, then the bone will deteriorate and damage\", because I had split the bone here, here, and here with these three teeth, all the way under.\n\n And I said, \"Well, you don't know what kind of a diet I'm on\".\n\n They think I'm a loony tune.\n\n And I said, \"Whatever it takes, I want you to pry that bone and work it back in\", excruciating pain.\n\n\r\nSo, I accepted some Novocain, so I'm dealing with it again.\n\n It's detoxing every 18 months, I've got it coming out here since those injections.\n\n First, the teeth will hurt here and here, and then it'll swell, then it hardens here.\n\n I take a little jar 12 ounce smooth jar or 16 ounce jar with hot water in it, and I put it up there.\n\n A hot water bottle's too big to go on my face.\n\n So, I take a little glass jar with a hot water and I put it there and will just sleep with it next to that area, and it softens that hardened stuff.\n\n \r\nSo, I know it's not going to come out as a boil, it's gonna be leaking down my gum.\n\n \r\nSo, I eat enough cheese and clay to absorb it a little bit throughout the day to absorb those toxins.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Organic Coconuts Dont Matter \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDoes it matter if it's organic or non-organic\n\n Cuz I can't find non-organic ones?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconuts, doesn't matter whether they're organic or not.\n\n The only time that they put chemicals around coconuts is if they've got a crop in between the coconuts, they'll be spraying for that crop.\n\n\r\nIf any pesticides get on the coconut, guess where it goes.\n\n They've got a husk on them anywhere from this big to this big, hairy husk underneath that, either green or gold or brown outer hard skin over it.\n\n So, in the center is your coconut, so all the poisons stay in those fibers, does not get into the coconut.\n\n\r\nI've had at least 7 coconuts, non-organic tested and I couldn't find even a trace amount of toxins in the meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou shouldn't waste your money on organic ones then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I don't know?\n\n There might be some traces that are undetectable.\n\n You have to understand there's a limit to our science.\n\n I could not find what they could find as a trace.\n\n\r\nTheir trace, that doesn't mean there's not something in it.\n\n So, if you can get organic, go for it, but the likelihood of you're having a problem with a non-organic coconut, it would be very difficult.\n\n You'll probably lose some nutrients cuz they won't be absorbed, but not likely to harm you.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Profesional Athelts and More Ritalin \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're an athlete, you should be a ditch digger, an athlete, carpenter, somebody who's always using their body\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if they had Ritalin and they have drug problems now, what do you recommend to help them get out of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just have to go cold turkey and sing and exercise a lot?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut say that didn't help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt will?\n\n I've.\n\n Patients who had 14 activity rings in their irises, that's the most I've ever seen.\n\n That means 14 hours of activity a day, 8 to 10 hours of exercise.\n\n Those are professional athletes, professional carpenters, ditch diggers, people who work hard labor every day, because that's their main product.\n\n\r\nHormones for physical activity, and I'd never seen anybody that wouldn't exhaust and be relaxed after 14 hours.\n\n And if I knew how many activity rings you had, I'd know how many hours you need.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it's not that I have an issue with being hyperactive.\n\n\r\nLike in fact, I'm actually feeling tired of depleted all the time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's because you've got other ailments and the drugs like Ritalin caused that problem.\n\n They call it the lethargy of the body cause that's what they're intended to do.\n\n Cause the lethargy in the body, yet you're still producing the hormones.\n\n \r\nThat's why you have that, I don't feel like exercising and then you're also full of anxiety.\n\n It's a catch 22, but that's what they want cuz then you'll stay on the medication for life.\n\n It's a trap, intended.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Protein Makes Hair Grow Fast \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe lubrication formula works for hair\n\n Protein makes hair grow fast.\n\n If I eat a pound/ pound and a quarter of meat a day, my hair grows an inch or more a month.\n\n \r\nMy nails, I have to cut them every 10 days when I'm eating that much meat.\n\n So, I usually eat a pound a day and it grows an inch a month.\n\n\r\nThat's a lot of hair.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Skin Rash \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI started getting all these boils or something, I didn't know what I was\n\n I let them go like for a month or something, but then they would go away and some of them would leave a mark, like it was a bruise.\n\n And anyway, I went to this holistic doctor and he gave me these herbs mix and I took it and it came up a lot worse, so I stopped it.\n\n\r\nHe lowered the dose, but I've been on this like three months.\n\n They come and go.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're not helping you.\n\n Your body is detoxing certain substances out the lymph system, goes into connective tissue, and then when it goes out the skin, it causes the rash.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt comes more at night and stuff.\n\n I cannot eat anything that is not like meat, chicken fish, or vegetables.\n\n If I eat any fruit meal, cheese, anything, it will start coming out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause that carries all the heavy minerals to get it through the skin.\n\n Because the dairy and the fruits contain the alcohol things to get it out through the skin.\n\n\r\nBecause right now, it's basically staying in your connective tissue.\n\n You want to get it out of there.\n\n You don't want to keep it there, you take hot hot baths.\n\n Perspire it out, melt it down and get it out, so it doesn't have to cause such blistering.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I stop the herbs and I take hot baths, and what else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut cream?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOn top.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you drink some coconut cream?\n\n 2 ounces of coconut cream or 3 tablespoons of coconut cream, 3 - 4 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 tablespoon of dairy cream, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of lime juice and 2 ounces of pineapple.\n\n\r\nThat'll help remove it for a bath.\n\n That's all by itself, you have it before the hot bath.\n\n That mixture is before the hot bath.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that's all I have to take.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat'll help a great deal?\n\n Without seeing your eyes, I don't know what toxins are in that tissue.\n\n I don't know what's causing it without seeing what you're discharging.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCould you repeat what the mixture was.\n\n \r\nRecipe:\r\n3 - 4 tablespoons of coconut cream\r\n2 tablespoons of lime juice\r\n1 tablespoon of lemon juice\r\n1

were part of the raw milk issue in 1998, all the way through 2001 that were with me.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere was a little 8 year old boy named Walker, he had asthma.\n\n So, he was a very sickly, weak little child and he got up there and he said, \"I have to have my raw milk, it's the only thing that makes me feel good\".\n\n He is now the number 2 high school tennis champion, the whole United States.\n\n All of the high schools in all of the United States, he's number 2.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes he drink water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n He just drinks a little water, but in the formula.\n\n In the sport formula.\n\n What you do is you take about 1 cup - 1.\n\n5 cups of tomato, 1.\n\n5 - 2 cups of cucumber puree.\n\n So, you're pureeing  the tomato and the cucumber.\n\n \r\nYou peel the cucumber, always peel the cucumber.\n\n That's cellulose, you can't digest and will interfere with digestion.\n\n And most of the time it's got some kind of petroleum wax, even if they're organic.\n\n If you've grown them yourself, take the peel and juice 'em with your juice and don't throw 'em away that way, but otherwise peel 'em get rid of the peels.\n\n You chop up that, blend it all together with.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n 3 - 4 tablespoons of coconut cream\r\n3 - 4 tablespoons of dairy cream\r\n1 egg\r\n1 tablespoon of vinegar\r\n1tablespoon of lemon juice \r\n4 tablespoons of a honey.\n\n \r\n\r\nI have tennis players who play 5 hours on that one quart of fluid and their competitors are drinking 3 - 4 quarts, a whole gallon of water in that 5 hours.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Sports Formula Ingreditens \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLeave the skins on the tomato\n\n You have.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n1.\n\n5 - 2 cups of cucumbers (peeled)\r\n3 - 4 tablespoons of coconut cream\r\n3 - 4 tablespoons of dairy cream\r\n1 tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar\r\n1 tablespoon of lemon juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe's begging.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nFor what.\n\n Meat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I give them meat, cheese, anything?\n\n It's a raven.\n\n I've got 4 Ravens that are this big, they're wing span is eight feet.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI can't see them.\n\n Where are they up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight up here?\n\n One of 'ems right up here.\n\n He's right over.\n\n the bear.\n\n This is usually the time I feed them.\n\n So, they'll come up and sit right on my balcony up here and beg me.\n\n\r\nNow, some athletes have problems with that much, honey, so you can cut it down to just 2 tablespoons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you put an egg in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, and you put an egg in there?\n\n If you're a sports person, you put an egg in.\n\n If you're not a sports person, you don't have to put an egg in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it sufficient for an hour or two hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat can take you through 5 hours of hard activity, tennis, anything?\n\n \r\nI've got a martial arts teacher, Sufi master on the diet, he hasn't consumed water in a year, no water.\n\n\r\nHe won't drink a lick of water and he does 10 hours of martial arts a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much vinegar per day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would keep it down to 1 tablespoon?\n\n If you're an athlete, heavy exercise, you can have 2.\n\n \r\nIf you're an athlete, if you're not an athlete, 1 tablespoon maximum.\n\n If you're on your feet doing hair all day, 2 tablespoons you'd get away with okay.\n\n If you're a sedentary worker and you don't do much, 1 tablespoon a day, maybe only 1.\n\n5 teaspoons a day, which is a half a tablespoon.\n\n\r\nVinegar can be very altering.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (66) Stainless Steel Water Bottle, Plsatic Vs Glass \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLast time I asked question about water bottles and I have this water bottle that's not glass insert, it's stainless steel\n\n And you said something about the ions and I left here not understanding it, what the damage is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnytime you have metal around food, it changes the electrical magnetic properties of the food, it draws in radio waves.\n\n Metal is a conductor of electricity of radio waves, and it's an attractor, it's an antenna for it.\n\n So, it'll draw compounds in there, which will break up the structure of your food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's damaging.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It's damaging to your body.\n\n If you're having just water in it, not gonna make any difference.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have kefir or milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you're going to disturb the food, it's going to be broken a little bit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, just water is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWater, it doesn't make any difference.\n\n Water's not alive.\n\n\r\nNo.\n\n Stainless steel will not, unless you put salt water in stainless steel, it will leach.\n\n If it's just plain water, it will not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, those new Neo bottles for water or anything are no good.\n\n They are plastic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPlastic, the water will pull, draw compounds out of it.\n\nThe FDA came out with a report that said, PBAs are safe.\n\n Hello.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but I mean the non PBA ones?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's PBA in all of them?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, glass glass is the only thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGlass is the only thing where you're safe?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, wow.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Toxins Leave Thru Skin \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGet this down\n\n Whenever you have a skin disorder or problem, you've got a toxin leaving the body, 90% of them leave through the skin, unless you're having diarrhea or vomit.\n\n Then a high proportion will go there, but 90% of your everyday toxins leave through the skin.\n\n If you got toxins leaving through the skin, that's a good thing.\n\n\r\nYou've got sores.\n\n Deal with them another way, but don't stop it.\n\n You take a steroid, it's a chemical What is a steroid.\n\n It's made with what?\n\n Trans fatty acids, synthesized proteins or extracted with kerosene or alcohol and kerosene out of soybeans, toxic substance?\n\n So, toxic that what happens.\n\n Your body deals with that toxin and stops detoxing the old stuff you had in the body that was going through the skin?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWonder drug.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Your wonder drug, but they're really not healing you or making you better.\n\n They just poisoned you to the point where your body has to deal with that poison and stop all the other old detox of poisons.\n\n \r\nThat's the time you just take care of the direct sores that you're having, and you treat them accordingly.\n\n You can use lime juice, coconut cream, the Primal Facial Body Care Cream, clay mixed with coconut cream.\n\n Keep it moist.\n\n That's what you want to help draw those poisons out, you don't wanna stop the poisons from drawing out.\n\n \r\nLook at this right here, you see the swelling I have.\n\n Last night it was huge swelling?\n\n When I was a child, every time I got Novocain or Xylocaine injected into my gums, I would blow up like this, and then I would get these hard tumors right here.\n\n And then for the next 10 days, they would boil up and they would burn my skin away.\n\n So I used to have these deep scars here.\n\n\r\nAnd since I stopped using Xylocaine and Novocain when I have dental work, I haven't had that problem.\n\n But I got mugged in Bangkok 3.\n\n5 years ago, and they broke these 2 teeth with the bone and knocked it under my tongue.\n\n They hit me with a crowbar or ball-peen hammer to get my movie camera away.\n\n\r\nSo, they knocked these teeth of this bone all the way down to here underneath my tongue.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (68) Vaccines Ignredients \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, how do you account for say the whole industry behind biological warfare contracts\n\n How do you account for that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to understand that their active ingredients is never the bacteria, just like in a vaccine?\n\n Why do they have liquid mercury, liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, detergents and ether, all poisons.\n\n\r\nWhy are those the main ingredient in a vaccine.\n\n Because if you take the bacteria and all of that, there won't really be a problem, except that the body reads it, when Pasteur was doing his experiments with animals, he was giving them a solution of almost pure disease diluted in distilled water with a slight bit of carbohydrate in it, like from grapes?\n\n\r\nEvery animal got anaphylaxis and died, not one animal ever survived a vaccine from Pasteur, but they found when other researchers started putting formaldehyde and other poisons strychnine in the vaccines, it'd stop the reaction cuz it would poison the body so much, it wouldn't even think about the disease.\n\n\r\nBecause the theory is there that disease was so high that the body would say I'm dying and die if they had that concentration of disease in the blood at one given time.\n\n So, the body would go into anaphylaxis, which is shock and it would die just because it thought it was very diseased from analyzing all of this disease particles in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I'm still confused.\n\n Are you saying that it's the formaldehyde.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe formaldehyde, the mercury, the aluminum that's causing all the disease?\n\n \r\nThe pollution is causing disease.\n\n The black plague was caused from coal.\n\n In 1302, the king and queen of England with their little side groups started the coal industry, people using coal in their homes to keep the house warm and to cook with .\n\nThe byproduct of burning coal is mercury vapors, damaged the lungs for that whole 30 year period, and you had the black plague.\n\n\r\nPlus you had on every other block you had a silversmith and on every other block, it was a blacksmith.\n\n So, you had their metallic vapors going into the streets of Paris and London, all the major cities.\n\n Most jewelry was silver and gold burned and the kilns all throughout the city.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (69) Vegetable Protein, Cucumber Collagen, Chlorella \n \n**[2008],[Jim]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm kind of searching for what would be a source of protein that is a vegetable source of protein\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSprouts are not digestible.\n\n The proteins and fats in sprout are not digestible.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nSo, what are vegetable sources of protein.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour cucumber, but it's mostly collagen related protein that you're going to get?\n\n We're not a vegetarian animal.\n\n\r\nWell, I would say go for chlorella.\n\n Chlorella will digest to probably 50%.\n\n\r\nChlorella is an algae, a type of algae, and you can get raw ones.\n\n**[unclear]**\n gets it from a very good source in Asia, and then they sell it in a little black container at Rawsome.\n\n Very expensive, but you're gonna only need a teaspoon a day if you have it.\n\n \r\nI mix it with cottage cheese, and egg, and it will digest better that way.\n\n Some people took it and put it in vegetable juice, but if you put it in vegetable juice, you have to let it sit in the vegetable juice for about 20 minutes.\n\n It's to get some vegetable type protein and fat that won't cause crystallization in the human body.\n\n Any other vegetable source will.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow often would you put it in juice.\n\n Every day?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhenever you feel like it, once a day is fine?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut I mean, you don't do it for 10 days and stop for 10 days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhatever you want, I've never done specific tests with it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the difference between that and meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are some elements that are finite that could be introduced into your body that allowed you to make different things that are unusual, could give you unusual mental abilities and stuff like that?\n\n That could be helpful for you.\n\n So, as long as it's not harmful, it's okay.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) Vinegar Can Brak Down Moles \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnother thing that I discovered about vinegar in the last three months was when I was 15, I don't quite remember\n\n My mother, one of her friends was a doctor, my mom was a nurse and I had 15 moles on my body, and one of them was in my scalp right here, and every time I ran a comb through it, it ripped it open.\n\n So, I bled everyday.\n\n \r\nSo, she was so afraid that was gonna turn into cancer and I was so sickly already all the time, diabetic by then, had Angina Pectoris by then.\n\n\r\nSo, what I found was that when I put vinegar twice a day on that mole, that was growing back and that one had roots on it.\n\n So, that mole had roots, so when I would touch either of these two, I could feel it deep into my body, at least an inch in.\n\n This one was very sore.\n\n So, I started putting vinegar on it morning and night, every day a layer peeled off.\n\n I'm saying how can it peel off for a whole month.\n\n I didn't do it every day, but it was peeling off a layer that could have been real deep, and I noticed that there was no root anymore?\n\n\r\nSo, the root was moving out every time I put it on and peel off a layer.\n\n So, this mole right here, which was black and three times the size just three months ago and deep.\n\n It's no longer deep, it's just brown now, and it's smaller, and no root.\n\n The same thing happened to this huge one here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust a couple drops.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust a drop on the end of your finger and rubbed on?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor a wart too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It doesn't remove as easily.\n\n It'll shrink it, but not get rid of it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do you suggest for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSame thing?\n\n You're not gonna get rid of a wart all the way, they have to somehow drop off on their own eventually.\n\n \r\nMine all dropped off on their own, sometimes I'd put potato peels on it, but that remedies in the book.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you have to eat raw to do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know?\n\n I always eat raw.\n\n I have a few people doing it, it's working.\n\n Some of them are eating 50% the diet, others up to 100%.\n\n\r\nSo, and it's working for all of them.\n\n Of course, the ones that are eating raw, it works faster and those who are having a little bit of vinegar with their vegetable juice, like 1.\n\n5 teaspoons in their first vegetable juice or with their first vegetable juice, it seems to be working a little bit better.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

And if I had had a high adrenaline, I might have taken a high offense to that as I would in my earlier days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nEspecially since they just walked away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, I just said, these are sad people, you know, they can just jump out in the street like that and then stand there and I'm coming at them and, you know, I hit, if they had jumped outta the way, would've been different, but they just froze like a deer with lights in their eyes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nSo, they didn't even look.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\n They didn't even look, they just jumped right into the street as if they were the only people on the- of course, I was slightly on the left side of the road cause I wanted to allow cars to go past me, you know?\n\n So, they weren't paying attention to this end side of the road?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Always Changed To Be Made, Re Read Book \n \n**[2007]**\n\nFirst thing I wanna say is that when you go on this diet, the primal diet, remember there's always adjustments to make\n\n Even if I put you on a diet and you go through some changes and you're going through certain kinds of detoxes and you have certain symptoms, you look up in the book the symptoms that you are having, and that's what you do.\n\n\nNow, you may not have the disease, but you have the symptoms.\n\n If you want to be able to access that quickly, the best thing to do is to go to https://www.\n\nwewant2live.\n\ncom/ and get the downloaded books.\n\n That way you can plug right into it on search and find on a PDF file, the Adobe reader file.\n\n\nThat's the easiest way to do it.\n\n The quickest.\n\n You don't have to go through an index.\n\n You don't do all of that.\n\n Of course the indexes in the books are okay, are pretty good.\n\n I had the latest version of We Want To Live, it has the primal diet on the cover.\n\n I had a professional couple who do indexes, they did it.\n\n So, it's pretty thorough.\n\n \nHowever, it's quicker to access if you're in a pinch and not feeling well and having some symptoms, it's always better to access it on your computer and get if the answers a little bit quicker, as quickly as possible.\n\n \nBut there always adjustments to make a lot of people say, well, you know, I got on the diet, I did great for a year, year and a half.\n\n And you know, I keep doing the same things or I've adjusted it.\n\n And if you're not doing well on it, it means you're not making the proper adjustments for your changes.\n\n So reread the books.\n\n A lot of people think one read through is okay.\n\n \nI have students that I had read it up to 16 times and for each reread, they got as much out of it as they did the first time.\n\n Because there's a lot of things that don't register until you experience it, and that's many years of experience in there.\n\n So, don't think that you have it down just because you've read the book once or twice, I recommend the people read it every 6 to 12 months, one read through in each book.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Animal Fats Dont Cause Heart Disease \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n \n\n \nWhen it has to clean the body out, it gets jammed\n\n It starts collecting all of the hardened fats, especially all of those hydrogenated vegetable oils or vegetable oils in general.\n\n Vegetable oils in the human body crystallize.\n\n That's what causes hardening of our heart and arteries, not animal fat.\n\n That's a myth, a fiction.\n\n  \nAn herbivore that eats vegetables and vegetable oil in their vegetables have a body temperature of 101° to 105°.\n\n Ours is 98.\n\n6° and lower.\n\n So, when we eat vegetable oils, if it's made a part of a cell, it will store in the body and crystallize over about a year to five-year period.\n\n \nAnd once it's crystallized, you cannot get it dissolved unless you can get the body temperature high enough.\n\n And that's 102° to 105°.\n\n So, you have to stay in it that long before it gets deep enough to get into those lymph glands and lymph nodes.\n\n  \nIt takes an hour to get there.\n\n Well, it takes about 50 minutes to get there.\n\n So, an hour you've spent 10 minutes starting to dissolve some of it melt some of it.\n\n You stay in a full hour and a half and you've melted at least a thousand of an inch.\n\n That's not much, but you figure each time you take a layer and dissolve it, you're going to melt it and get it out of your body.\n\n You're gonna start relieving it from the body.\n\n \nOtherwise, you're not.\n\n Your lymphatic system will stay congested for your entire life.\n\n I don't care what diet you're on.\n\n Even if you're on this diet.\n\n I don't care if you do trampoline for the lymphatic system or what, it will not move if it's hardened.\n\n It has to be softened.\n\n It has to be softened.\n\n  \nSo, what you do is before you get in the bath, like it says in the book, you make it have a combination of pineapple, coconut cream, a tiny bit of dairy cream, a tiny bit of butter and a little bit of honey.\n\n And you blend that all together and you drink it right before you get into the bath or as soon as you get into the bath.\n\n  \nThen when you get out of the bath in an hour to an hour and a half, you get out of the bath, you're gonna feel like a wet noodle, a limp noodle and you're not gonna wanna move very fast, and you wanna keep that door closed cause you want that bathroom to stay hot and you wanna towel off gradually.\n\n Then you wanna dress with winter clothes, I don't care how hot it is, and then you take a 45-minute walk.\n\n  \nBy the time you are taking that walk, that pineapple coconut mixture is going to be in your lymphatic system.\n\n Moving in there while that little bit of lymph space is still fluid.\n\n So, when it moves in there, it can't harden when your body reaches 98.\n\n6° and lower again, it will not harden.\n\n It'll keep that little space, that little fine little area fluid.\n\n \nYou don't do any more than two a week.\n\n Some people should, if you're very thin, you you shouldn't do any until you put on weight and you have to be at least 10, 15 pounds overweight before you do those.\n\n Because when that stuff dumps into the system, you better have enough fat to protect you.\n\n \nIf you're dumping something like mercury or Thallium or lead into that tissue.\n\n If you don't have the fats in the tissue, you are going to be damaged.\n\n And what happens if you damage your connective tissue.\n\n You're either going to develop lupus or Ms?\n\n Not a pretty picture.\n\n  \nSo, you've got to have at least 10, 15 pounds overweight before you do those hot baths.\n\n Once you start doing them, you can do two a week.\n\n Never closer than three days apart.\n\n So, if you went on the same day of the weeks as the same days of the week, say you do it on Monday and then you do it on Thursday.\n\n It should be done between 1:30 and 4:30 in the afternoon.\n\n So, you do one on a weekend or if you can only do in the afternoon on the weekends, you just do it one day a week on the weekend.\n\n \nThen each day you can do a 35-to-40-minute bath and you don't have the pineapple coconut cream mixture.\n\n You don't need that.\n\n That 35-to-40-minute bath is to relieve the toxins that have dumped from the lymphatic system in the connective tissue to perspire it out of the body or pull it out of the skin, so it doesn't collect in there.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Antibiotic Formula \n \n \n \n \n### (6) Aspartame 11 Names \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nChewing gum, aspartame and that kind of thing\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nNo, it's none of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nSure it isn't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nXylitol.\n\n That's all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThey have got 11 names for Aspartame, and if you wanna know every name, no 9 names for Aspartame and some of them they're calling it natural because they wash it.\n\n\nThey're calling it clean and natural and good for health in, people.\n\n So look it up the 9 names for Aspartame.\n\n Find out what they are because they're on almost everything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo just concerning the beeswax, I'm just wondering it has any health properties.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes.\n\n It helps the skin immensely.\n\n\nThe hydrochloric acid dissolves it and it helps the skin, helps protects the ears.\n\n It helps do a lot of things, protects the eyes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, you just swallow it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou chew it and if it gets too dry, just put a little butter in your mouth with it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAnd you swallow it at the end.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nSwallow it, yeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIt just breaks up gradually as you eat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNot for some people, some people don't have the right proper enzymes in their mouth?\n\n But you have a good mouth.\n\n You have good activity in your mouth.\n\n You have good bacteria and enzymes in your mouth.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Bath Too Hot At 110 \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nDid like 110°\n\n Is that okay.\n\n Or is that ideal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's not a good idea?\n\n 110 is pretty hot.\n\n You're gonna start cooking the enzymes and vitamins in your skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, what's the max temperature.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\n105?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\n105\n\n\nYeah.\n\n There's a misprint in the first book.\n\n In fact, all the way up until this last printing, there's a misprint.\n\n\nIt says 110°.\n\n It should be at top 105°.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nHow do you know if it's gonna be 105.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou can have a thermometer?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Brain Damage and Hyperative - Fish and Cream \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nShe had a head injury, a year ago was it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAnd her brain is hyperactive and she wanted to know how to calm it.\n\n And I suggested fish and cream together, not a lot of cream, but fish and cream together.\n\n Don't sit down and drink a half a cup with your fish, cuz it's gonna coat your fish and you won't digest it.\n\n\nBut you could use like three tablespoons with a fish meal and drinking like a tablespoon of cream about every two hours is going to help protect the brain.\n\n Remember cream protects the brain and nervous system butter does not.\n\n \nI said every hour and a half.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nAbout the corn on your feet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI don't have any corn on my feet.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nI mean, anybody that does use it's in the book.\n\n It says that you should use papaya.\n\n\nRight now they have the orange papaya, which is with a lot of seeds and the black seeds, of course would take out the seeds.\n\n We're not gonna coat our foot with that.\n\n It says about once a week.\n\n Now, also I soak my feet in that soap.\n\n Do I need to keep doing that every week, putting it on the oil.\n\n It's olive oil and papaya.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNow, are you talking about a corn, are you talking about wart.\n\n What are you talking about?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nThe corn under your foot?\n\n And then I also was last week.\n\n I was not supposed to put my feet in soapy water, but cuz I had lime on it instead of putting coconut cream on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhat's your question.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nWell, I wanna know, do I put it on both feet, papaya and olive oil because olive oil will help?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDo you have a corn on both feet.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nNo, just this one?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, then why would you put it on both.\n\n\nRemember I told you to do it for maybe four times?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nFour times a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI said put what and clay?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nClay and papaya?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOkay.\n\n Clay and papaya.\n\n You coat the foot with it.\n\n That's right.\n\n You use the moisturizer.\n\n\nYou do that every day for four days.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nI didn't hear four days.\n\n It wasn't on my tape.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's when your tape ended and you turned it over.\n\n Probably pretty much absorbs into the skin, so you just take some time to get out.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nSo, I could start for four days again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou could try it?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Bringing Milk On Plane and Eggs \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWhat do you do\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you want to get beyond that, you take quite a few little small three ounce bottles?\n\n You can have six or seven of them as long as they fit into a one-quart ziplock bag.\n\n So, three ounces of milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCan I put two eggs in each.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou can do that?\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nWhat if you wanna bring food for your trip.\n\n Like some ceviche or some butter, and now they're getting some stricter and not even letting you take?\n\n They confiscated my ceviche last time, six months before that they didn't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, if it's wet and liquid, they're gonna take it.\n\n Anything that's like at all, wet.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nAnything that's like at all wet, yogurt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, you can't bring milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou can take milk in a three ounce container, many three ounce containers?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCheck the cooler.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, cuz the radiation is very heavy in those machines?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, is there any way around it.\n\n Letter?\n\n Doctor?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes?\n\n You can have a doctor's letter.\n\n I take a whole half a gallon every time I go.\n\n\nBut I've got a doctor's letter.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHe told me, I don't care if you have a doctor's, this is as much as you can eat on the plane.\n\n That's it.\n\n That's what he said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, I tell them I eat two quarts on the plane.\n\n I'll say I'm diabetic, I was diagnosed as diabetic.\n\n That's what my doctor's letter said.\n\n It doesn't say I still have diabetes.\n\n It says I was diagnosed as diabetic.\n\n So, he asked to eat every hour.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nThey let you bring in larger containers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI'll take two of these and I'll take two of these?\n\n\nI have my bag and I take it out and hand my doctor's letter.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nDid they x-ray did it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nMost of the time they don't?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDo you take your green drink and your meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI usually have my green drink in the morning?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDo you take your eggs whole and the egg shells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThey say are these hard boiled?\n\n And I say they're as hard as I want them?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat if they weren't hardboiled, what would they care.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nCause it's liquid?\n\n I know they're stupid.\n\n They are really ridiculous.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHave you had good success.\n\n I mean, most of the time?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhen I leave Los Angeles I would say 75% of the time they don't scan my food?\n\n They never take my food away from me.\n\n They don't wanna be responsible for a diabetic incident.\n\n There's no way they want be responsible for a diabetic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI should use mine to my advantage to get a note for my doctor that I'm diabetic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nBut you're not a diabetic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, no, no?\n\n My doctor said I was diagnosed as diabetic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI could say the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nRight?\n\n Were you taking insulin at some time.\n\n Were you diabetic?\n\n Were you diagnosed as diabetic?\n\n Okay?\n\n I was, I took insulin from 15.\n\n5 to 20.\n\n\nNo, I'm not anymore.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nSo, what about people who have never been diabetic.\n\n Is there another solution?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLittle small bottles?\n\n That's it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhen I was there last time, I've got real problems.\n\n So, I bring a note from the doctor.\n\n He said no way.\n\n He said, I don't care what you bring, you're not taking it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThese are lackies.\n\n You get supervisor.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI've had to change airports and I have what I need and I've had it all taken from me.\n\n And I've asked for supervisors and I've said, I'm diabetic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou have to take a letter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI can try to, but I'm afraid after all this happening, I'm afraid that, that the letter won't mean anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt works for everybody I know that takes a letter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nLet's just say that we can't take anything on the plane.\n\n\nAny suggestions to help us get through a long plane way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou can take your three ounce bottles?\n\n \nAs long as what you have fits in a ziploc quart bottle, you can take as many as you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYou can't have it done x-ray though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, they'll have to have an x-ray, but when you put it through the x-ray, you let everything go through, everything behind it?\n\n You wait until your food has gone through.\n\n You hold up the line.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat do you mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBecause if they've got a bag in front that they're going to sit and look at for two minutes and decide whether they're going to inspect it and your food's right behind it, that's gonna get bombarded?\n\n\nSo you let that pass through.\n\n And if he's sitting and waiting, you know that that's the last one.\n\n Then you put your food on there when he starts it up again, your food's gonna go through and they'll just pass through cause there won't be any metal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI always thought I was nuts for doing that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, that's what I do.\n\n And then after I know that he's okayed it nothing goes on that.\n\n My next luggage doesn't go on that belt until I know he's okayed it and it's passing through and the belt's moving.\n\n Yeah, but there's metal on the control.\n\n One important thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI put it in my big suitcase that I checked and put it in coolers and packed it well, and randomly they choose maybe every fourth one to unzip, and look at, which mine has been that, and they've even found all my grapes.\n\n I've checked a lot of food and gotten it through.\n\n It's just on the plane.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThen you've got high, high radiation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIt's higher there than it is in the.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh, it's extremely high?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI have a Cola that I make and I can check it in as luggage, and I tell 'em it says food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes.\n\n You have to do that, and you have to do that at the desk, at the desk.\n\n That's what I do when I go to China, when I'm taking 30 pounds of butter and all kinds of other things with me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYou take a cooler.\n\n Is that what you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, I take a cooler?\n\n\nAnd then I go to the desk and I say, I need you to hand check this, and pass it through.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, the radiation's not in the plane where the luggage department is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, it's the, x-ray, big huge machine they have?\n\n I mean, it puts out like 50 x-rays worth in one shot as your luggage passes through.\n\n\nSo, if you've got any food in that, it's highly radioactively charge, your mineral's in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI'm a part of a small team.\n\n Main team comes in from Tokyo.\n\n We treat mostly physicians who have less than eight or nine days to live.\n\n They've already had chemo.\n\n They've had radiation, they've had surgery that really need to be carried in, and so I have to go through this with this young lady every time I go through the airport and I do ask for the supervisor.\n\n\nIf he hassles me, I take heavy weight, a little foil and wrap it into exactly what you say, clear the dead, let him run through and it seems to work each time.\n\n And I mean, it may hassle them, but what seems to do the most is when the line backs up.\n\n They don't like the pressure from the line.\n\n So they usually say, okay, let's go.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, it depends upon, some personalities and some people can get it through easily.\n\n  Always ask for a supervisor.\n\n Cause the lackies are told and these are lackies.\n\n They have no brains.\n\n If you have a brain, you're not in TSA.\n\n Seems to be a rule.\n\n So, you  have to get a supervisor to get any, but most of 'em will tell you no, unless you have a letter.\n\n\nSo, your safe way is just little three ounce bottles if you want to take your liquid.\n\n They're just gonna think it's shampoo.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAre they plastic or not plastic though.\n\n Some are glass?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nGlass is nice if you can get glass.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut there is metal on top.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs plastic alright.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell it's okay for a short trip?\n\n\nWell, it doesn't show up as something alarming.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Can Teeth Regenerate Like Bone \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nCan teeth regenerate the way bone can\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nShe asked, can teeth regenerate the way bone can?\n\n No?\n\n Not in my experience.\n\n I've only found it happen with two people that were under 25.\n\n One had a huge cavity and they didn't have it filled, and within six months of starting to drink raw milk, it filled in.\n\n \nThe whole tooth.\n\n The tubule filled in and then the dentine grew back.\n\n \nNow, I've had teeth where- it's only been in the last six years that I have fillings that the body starts growing back.\n\n The facials start growing the tubules.\n\n It'll grow, it'll take that composite filling and grow it out.\n\n So, it's got all these edges on it and I have to keep having it drilled down and filed down because the tubule is now growing, 60 years old.\n\n So, now it's finally come to that.\n\n I'm healthy enough.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nIt can grow back if you are on the diet long enough.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nIf you're on the diet long enough, it's probably very possible depending upon how severe the damage is that you sustained, and my teeth were a mess from chemo and radiation.\n\n I'm lucky I got the bone back around my teeth because after radiation therapy, I lost all the bone around my teeth.\n\n So, my teeth dangled in my gums like this.\n\n So, if I bit down on my own teeth, I lost about a half a cup of blood at a time.\n\n Couldn't stop the bleeding.\n\n  \nSo, what I did was I blended my donuts in RC Cola and then drank it with a thick straw.\n\n That's where I was then, I didn't know any better.\n\n  \nBut then when I started drinking raw milk, within a year and a half of drinking the raw milk on a daily basis about anywhere from a half a gallon to a gallon a day, my bone around my teeth all restored.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cant Gain Weight \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWell, I guess I have a problem of not being able to gain weight\n\n I can lose 15 pounds or 12 pounds in two weeks, and then it'll take seven years to get fat.\n\n I'm still not at my regular weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, that's an indication you're not digesting well.\n\n\nSo, take two days and eat lots of eggs.\n\n Eat like 40 eggs a day for two days, and then when you eat the regular diet in my recipe book.\n\n The one where there's just two meat meals a day and you make that moisturizing formula.\n\n It's called the moisturizing lubrication formula.\n\n For women it's moisturizing, for men it's lubrication.\n\n\nMake two of those, make a double batch and have a third of it after each meat meal and a third during the night.\n\n You will gain weight, I promise.\n\n  \n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cataracts \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWhat about cataracts\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nCataracts?\n\n That'll help cataracts?\n\n I would use both.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nBoth what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nCoconut cream and the lime juice and I would alternate them using the egg white in the eyes with cataracts?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, the egg white, how do you use that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI eat the rest of the egg white, I'm eating eggs all day long?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOkay, well some of us can't eat eggs all day long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf I do it, I eat an egg.\n\n I use it and then eat the egg.\n\n That's it.\n\n\nThen the next time I eat another egg, I can do it again if I want.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nYep.\n\n That's what I do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, then I would suggest you take one of those little one ounce or half ounce little containers, put a little egg white in there and close it.\n\n Keep it from oxidizing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat about keratoconus.\n\n Same thing?\n\n Egg white or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI would use a combination for that because that's always a scarring?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nWhat is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's a scarring of the inner layer of the cornea or right on the Iris itself?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nI've got an egg white method I've been using for the last few months.\n\n What I do is before I go to bed and when I get up in the middle of the night, I always use the eggs.\n\n I get an eight ounce jar.\n\n I crack the eggs in the jar.\n\n I stick my fingers in the egg white, and I just keep my eyes open and I just rub it all over.\n\n Kind of keep 'em slip and I down the egg.\n\n And then when I get up in three or four hours, I do the same thing, I do an egg and I stick my fingers in there.\n\n\nI just keep my eyes open a slit and down the egg, it's much faster than doing that Aajonus.\n\n I could never get around to that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut most people won't like that egg white all over their eyelashes and everything.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nI'm single, I live alone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nSo, they're not worried about your cakey white cause you will have that.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nI have that, but it comes off in the shower.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Cheese & Honey, Tumor From Mineral Ssupplements \n \n**[2007],[Lewis]**\n\n\n\nWhenever you eat it they should both be in the mouth together\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you want to absorb the minerals and the fats in it and the protein?\n\n If you don't, if you want it to be a sponge and a magnet for toxins, you don't eat it with honey.\n\n\nYou just eat it alone, but that doesn't mean you can't eat it with a meal.\n\n It'll still act like that with a meal.\n\n The honey's the only thing that will convert that cheese into something to digest.\n\n We're talking about raw cheese here.\n\n Pasteurized cheese is already fractionated.\n\n You're going to absorb those minerals, even though they cauterized, and they're gonna do some damage in your system.\n\n \nFor the first time I had a patient who had a tumor that had very little chemical in it.\n\n He had a lot of DMSO in it, cuz he used to take that DMSO chemical and it's sold as something really good.\n\n So he had DMSO in it, plus it had tons of magnesium, phosphorus and potassium.\n\n Off the charts in those minerals, but very low on calcium comparatively.\n\n And he had taken supplements galore, mineral supplements.\n\n Of course, these were cauterized minerals, so his body couldn't use them.\n\n So, he created this huge tumor and when it was finally removed and I had it analyzed those were the results of it.\n\n\nFirst tumor that I'd had analyzed it didn't have some kind of heavy industrial compound in it, chemical or heavy metal.\n\n It had no heavy metals, it had all the light metals and way too many of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhy was he taking DMSO in the first place.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI think he was warding off arthritis or rheumatism, something like that?\n\n And that was like 10 years ago, 15 years ago.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nHe's okay now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, he's okay now?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Cheese and Honey For Minerals \n \n \n \n \n### (15) Cheese In A Magnet \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nNow the cheese is medicinal\n\n You lose the ability to digest it, but it acts as a magnet.\n\n Even starts in the mouth as your bloodstream, your neurological system, and your lymph system moves throughout the entire intestinal walls and digestive tract walls, the cheese acts as a magnet, and will draw poisons out of those three fluid systems.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cheese With Honey Mineral Supplement \n \n \n \n \n### (17) Chemtrail Diet \n \n \n \n \n### (18) Chemtrails \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nIs there something called chemtrails or something like that planes release flying over places\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCan you tell me about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's not a subject that I like to get into here, cuz it's a very complex one and the US government is bombing us and is spreading their waste products from industrial military development over us?\n\n It's got aluminum, it's got all kinds of- barium, other waste products from developing military weapons.\n\n They have nowhere to store it anymore, so they're bombing it all over the place.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, the whole United States is like getting it pretty much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhen I was in Thailand in February and the US military was there?\n\n The US military goes to Thailand every year and does exercises with them and teaches them how to be good military people.\n\n And they were bombing there for the first time chemtrailing that whole area.\n\n Taught 'em how to chemtrail.\n\n So, it's happening all over.\n\n \nIt's all over Europe, all over Europe.\n\n These big military machines, they have to have somewhere to dump their poisons, so they dump it on their own population.\n\n\nThey have to spread it all over.\n\n They're doing it everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThey can't bury it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThey're trying to thin it out everywhere, and there's so many people that it's okay to damage?\n\n The casualty rate is 500 out of 10,000.\n\n That's an acceptable loss that the military and the government considers okay.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Chlorine, How To Detox \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWe took our child for swimming lessons this summer\n\n I was just wondering if there's anything you can do before or after the pool that would help mitigate like all the chlorine and all the chemicals in the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nChlorine?\n\n There's no way you can get around it.\n\n You got chloroform vapors.\n\n That's the worst.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIt was an outdoor pool.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDoesn't make any difference, when your head is this close to the water, unless you've got a hell of a wind.\n\n It is going to get into your system.\n\n There's no way around it.\n\n You can always put olive oil, butter, or coconut cream on your skin or coconut oil on the skin to protect your skin from absorbing the chlorine, but you have to understand chlorine is meant to dissolve.\n\n The greatest mineral in our hydrochloric acid is chlorine.\n\n So, chlorine eats away at things, so if you're gonna be in the one of the swimming pools, never going in indoor one.\n\n You're just asking for a lot of lung and sinus and brain toxicity.\n\n\nSo, if you're in an outdoor one and there's a breeze, eh you're going to get some toxicity, it's gonna plant the ears.\n\n That's why swimmers have so many ear conditions and sore throats and sinus problems, cuz of all that chloroform that they're breathing in, just remember chloroform transforms into formaldehyde in the human body often.\n\n \nSo, formaldehyde is a very toxic substance.\n\n So, swimming pools is not a good thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\n Primal Facial beforehand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\n Primal Facial's probably not a good one to do?\n\n You want something heavy oil.\n\n Like the butter or olive oil or coconut oil.\n\n\nSomething that's gonna really cake, and chlorine's gonna take a long time to eat through that oil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut nothing you could do for the vapors.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNothing you can do for the vapors?\n\n Well, you can eat something to help get rid of it, but that what's planted in the brain is not gonna be easy to get rid of.\n\n \nThose vapors are so finite even if you let's say put some cotton with some oil on and if you're breathing through it, it will filter out some of it and those oils will arrest some of it, but it won't be easy.\n\n As soon as you get water in that cotton, you're not gonna be able to breathe and they're gonna come out anyway.\n\n\nSo, there's really no way to keep cotton balls up there in your nose to help filter it out with some oil on it.\n\n \nBut if you want to get rid of formaldehyde and the toxicity from the chloroform.\n\n You take a half of a mango, a green mango, a tart mango, one kiwi, a tablespoon of honey, about four tablespoons of coconut cream, tablespoon of dairy cream, blend that all together, you can even put, let's say a teaspoon of lemon in with it also.\n\n Blend that together and then eat that that'll help get rid of formaldehyde and chloroform from the body.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\nCan I get back to the dog.\n\n Cuz you said the dog had that rash and you said it was from formaldehyde from the vaccines?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt will probably give the dog some diarrhea, but that's okay.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\nBecause the rash is just getting bigger.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs there anything you would recommend.\n\n Like my association, I went to them and said, can you not put the chlorine in?\n\n\nAnd they said, sure, give us a better solution?\n\n So, I don't know what is better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes, you get the salt chlorinators.\n\n It's electric, they're called electrical chlorinators.\n\n What it is is you put salt, like rock salt, just sea salt, rock salt is sea salt.\n\n It's not cleaned.\n\n It's not sterilized like your table salt is, and then chlorine added to it.\n\n So, you just put that rock salt in the pool, and it sends electrical charge through it and it converts some of that salt into chlorine that is non chloroform vapor producing it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs it okay for the skin as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's great?\n\n My landlord just built a pool down here and I that's where I go swim now.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Coconut Cream While Swimming \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nNo, still water dries out the skin\n\n So, you still want something on the skin.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nLike coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLike coconut cream?\n\n Coconut cream is not all that as heavy and that's a nicer thing to use.\n\n Nicer for the skin because the coconut cream has water soluble vitamins and minerals, as well as the oil soluble and oil in the coconut cream is only 5% of the coconut cream.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Cold Cream Is Fine \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWant to drink a cold dairy product\n\n Cream is fine, cuz it doesn't make any difference?\n\n The hydrochloric acid doesn't need do anything with the fat.\n\n That's all in duodenum already because the that's where the body shoots bile into the fat is in the duodenum.\n\n So, you don't have to worry about eating cream cold.\n\n That's fine.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Cold Meat With Milk \n \n**[2007],[Fred]**\n\n\n\nWhat if you eat cold meat, can he drink the warm milk on top or do you have to wait\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nHe should wait?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nHow long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nProbably 20, 30 minutes?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nThat long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Cooking, Pasteurized Milk, Vitamin D \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nCooking at 141° destroys 50% of the calcium, just at 141°\n\n\nSo, that's why pasteurization was so bad.\n\n Now that the pasteurization is up around 169° to 170°, so almost 90% of the calcium is destroyed.\n\n And do you know what they do with pasteurized milk.\n\n They get mined calcium, mined calcium, and they shovel it into the tanks and then stirred up in there because when they pasteurize and skim the milk and treat it nowadays, it turns blue?\n\n\nSo, they put the calcium also in it to turn it white.\n\n The vitamin D that they add to it is hydrogenated vegetable oils, which is plastic, and they irradiate it with ultra violent lights and call that vitamin D.\n\n Doesn't have any relationship to vitamin D, but you can convince any politician.\n\n You say, oh, sun rays, radiation touches fat in the body, turns it into vitamin D.\n\n So, we'll make vitamin D by taking fat and irradiating it.\n\n That is their thinking.\n\n And people buy it, people accept it.\n\n So, all that vitamin D is completely toxic.\n\n It's irradiated plastic, and then they just sell you that this milk is good.\n\n This pasteurized milk is good.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Cottage Cheese \n \n**[2007],[Fred]**\n\n\n\nDoes cottage cheese count as cheese, or is that more like a kefir\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's more like a cheese?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nSo, the same thing applies to cottage cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nRight?\n\n It's just that because some of it's fluid in it, you will have some bioactive enzymes in cottage cheese that you won't have in dried cheese.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Dehydrated Meat \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nDehydrating the meat a little\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOkay.\n\n If you dehydrate the meat, you lose your enzymes and a lot of the ability to utilize your proteins and digest in general.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nSo, beef jerky is bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBeef jerky is terrible?\n\n But if he wants to let his meat dry a little bit, it's not going to be that bad.\n\n\nJust eat a little honey with it, to add some enzymes.\n\n\nYeah, they'll just leave it out on a plate.\n\n They do that a lot done a lot in Pangai, in Hawaii.\n\n A lot of the people don't like the fresh tasting meat.\n\n They like it slightly dried.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYou could run a fan over it right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n But still, when you're dehydrating, you're losing the electromagnetic energy, the field of energy of that food.\n\n\nIt's like the Indians every year, the Eskimos and the Inuit and the Canadian Indians will make a pemmican.\n\n They'll dry meat, beat it until it becomes a flour and then mix it with some kind of a lard, whether it's some buffalo, seal, whatever they have available, and they bake it in the sun till it melts together, and then they press it into a 90 pound cube, and they will keep that throughout the whole winter incase they can't find any food for the hunt.\n\n If they don't need to eat it, whatever they don't eat during the winter, they bury it in the spring.\n\n They don't eat it.\n\n Even though they've gone to all this great length to have this dry meat and go through this whole process, it is just for survival.\n\n\nThey know that it will leach enzymes and lots of properties out of the body and will weaken the body.\n\n So, they bury it.\n\n They will not eat it.\n\n They only eat it if they're starving.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Difficulty Eatign Raw Meat, Voer Alkaline \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nSo, I would like to ask you, is there a connection between emergency knee and a pH balance in the body\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nThe what and the pH?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nI've been having difficulty eating the raw meat?\n\n I'm very repulsed by it, and I wondered if there was a connection between the pH of the body, alkaline/acid that would possibly cause that because some days I can eat the meat with no trouble and then the next day or two I'm just repulsed by it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWhen the bloodstream or the intestines gets over alkanalized it causes a neutralizing of the acid digestive juices in the intestines.\n\n So, you won't be able to digest the meat as well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nWell, how do I.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, you need to reduce the amount of fruit that you're eating to almost nothing?\n\n \nHave no more than 12 ounces of vegetable juice a day and break it up into three, four ounces at a time, and then you shouldn't have a problem.\n\n People who have that problem eat too much fruit or they drink too much vegetable juice.\n\n The over alkanalizes the intestines.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Eggs For Ernergy After Workout \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nI go to gym before I go to work, and can you tell me a little bit good to regain some energy quickly\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nBefore, or after the gym?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nAfter exercise I'm pretty tired?\n\n Then I have to go to work because that's my schedule.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nI would say down five eggs.\n\n You saw Rocky.\n\n Okay, he breaks the five eggs into a glass and downs and then goes and does his workout?\n\n \nAnd then he wipes his mouth like that.\n\n And it doesn't work if you don't wipe your mouth like that.\n\n \nJust 5 raw eggs and you'll have the energy back.\n\n \nWell, you can also eat little amounts of meat if you get tired often.\n\n You know, little golf ball sizes of meats, and that'll pick you up.\n\n But after a heavy workout, five eggs for your size of person, five eggs minimum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nWith honey or with milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nNo, you need the eggs alone?\n\n \nAnd then maybe 20 minutes later, have some honey and butter.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nHow do you combine the honey and butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nJust stir it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nAnd how much honey and butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nFor a workout like that for you, probably six butter to one?\n\n Honey.\n\n \nWhat about for when I do a yoga workout.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nProbably a little bit more honey in that situation, you're not burning as much fat?\n\n Heavy workout like his, you're burning a lot of fat.\n\n  \nBurning is the wrong word.\n\n We don't really burn.\n\n We utilize the fat.\n\n When you eat, you don't burn your nutrients up.\n\n You don't cook them in your body.\n\n You disassemble everything and they create different energy sources.\n\n That's what happens.\n\n So, it's not really burning a fat, it's utilizing fat as energy.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Eggs Whits For Vision \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nYou were talking earlier about putting coconut thing in your eye for a particular condition, which I don't have, but my eyes are deteriorating\n\n My eyesight isn't as good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nEgg white.\n\n If you're getting scar tissue or you're getting layers on your cornea, then the coconut cream and the lime will work.\n\n \nBut if you just need protein to strengthen the cornea, so it doesn't misshape, you just put egg white in the eye.\n\n People who put egg white in their eye, two to three times a day, usually lose 10 to 30% of their prescription per year, reduces.\n\n But they do it two to three times a day.\n\n The people who do it once a day, it may take two, three years for 'em to decrease 10%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nOne eye sees further and the other, you know, all that stuff.\n\n I have no idea about the shape or what's causing it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nThat's what causes it.\n\n One, the conation gives you farsighted vision and the one that flattens gives you nearsighted vision.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nAre you saying you can use egg white for any eye problems.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \nAny eye problems \n\n \nHow much?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWhat I tell people to do is take the egg white and put a little dab on the little finger or this finger, usually the little one?\n\n And you just get a little bubble of egg white on there.\n\n You pull the lid down; you look up and you just rub it along the bottom of the white of the eye.\n\n \nAnd then you open both of them and then you roll your eye like a circus master and get it all over coated, and then you close your eye and that's it.\n\n You may be a little foggy for about two or three minutes.\n\n It looks like you're going through some foggy water there a little bit, clears pretty quickly.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Exercsiing & Stretching. Lymph Baths \n \n**[2007],[Fred]**\n\n\n\nWhen I last was exercising, I did like yoga stretches and weight lifting\n\n If I stopped exercising, I found that after three months I was still the same strength, but if I stopped stretching for a week, I'd almost lose everything.\n\n \nWhy is there such a discrepancy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOn this diet, when you're eating raw meats and raw fats, I don't do anything?\n\n I mean, literally I'm on the computer and I just hold this.\n\n Once every February I'll come and trim some trees, about two tons of trees and drag those around and haul it, but that's the only heavy work I ever do, and I retain the muscles.\n\n On this diet you retain muscle very easily.\n\n \nHowever, because we're so toxic, we always have minerals combining with poisons to try to neutralize them, to alkalanalize those over acidic free radicals that are throughout the body.\n\n So, that causes calcifications.\n\n They call it calcification because the highest mineral is always calcium, but it's a conglomerate of minerals.\n\n It's not just mainly calcium, but these deposits will collect everywhere and that causes stiffness, and then you have to get the lubrication.\n\n You have to get the lymph system moving into those areas and the blood and the neurological fluids all have to get in there to make sure that these are dissolved and they don't stay growing as crystals.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nAnything you can do to mitigate it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n Be on the diet 40 years.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Feeding Chicken Protein \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nWhat about when they clip the beaks\n\n Does that matter at all to you when they're chicken?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nMost of 'em are gonna do that in those big ranches anyway?\n\n Because they don't feed 'em good protein now.\n\n  \nAmos Miller's ranch and all my Amish farmer's ranch.\n\n When I was in DC, I spent the at Amos's ranch, these chickens, they slaughter an animal and they take all of the remains out there, not the guts, they give that to the pigs and chickens, they'll take guts out there for the chickens.\n\n And they slop it out there for those chickens, those chickens never peck each other.\n\n \nBecause they get all the meat that they want.\n\n They're happy.\n\n They're like happy ducks.\n\n They will follow you, they're happy, they're nice.\n\n They're not frantic protein deficient, crazy creatures.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nThey feed them meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nThey feed em meat?\n\n They feed them raw meat.\n\n Meat scraps after butchering.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nThey're so tiny though.\n\n I mean when I buy the mat Rawsome, they're so tiny.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, just the one he slaughters.\n\n He likes his older ones for laying eggs.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nThere's no meat on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, there's little meat.\n\n Very little.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Fermented Coconut Oil \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nCoconut cream\n\n Would you leave that in the fridge for six months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo?\n\n It only takes 19 hours of room temperature for oil to separate from coconut.\n\n It's that quick, 19 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nFrom coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nFrom coconut cream, yeah?\n\n And that's the process in the Philippines and Thailand where we get ours.\n\n We're just getting Thailand right now from some friends of mine that make it.\n\n\nAnd it's a 19 hour process and I've sat there and watched them do it.\n\n And it's a delicate process and you have to have certain kinds- you've got these glass bats that are made and they go up and funnel like this.\n\n And then they've got a glass decanter on it that allows- cause the oil goes to the bottom.\n\n So, they have to drain the oil off of the bottom and then they have to do it again to make sure it's completely pure, so it doesn't start fermenting in any way, more fermentation cuz then if it goes into the jar and ferments, it's illegal in this country.\n\n FDA says there can be no gaseous fermentation growing in a product, so they usually cook the hell out of everything, so nothing's alive and nothing's growing.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nBut you can make that yourself in the fridge.\n\n\nJust put it in the fridge?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo.\n\n Is it coconut oil.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus],[They mean coconut cream, not coconut oil]**\n\n\n\nCoconut oil you don't put in the fridge.\n\n It'll never separate.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nOh, just leave it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nTo get coconut oil out of coconut cream, it has to be room temperature.\n\n Coconut cream in the refrigerator never separates or rarely separates and when it does it gets very slimy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs it okay to eat both the oil and the cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOil again just has the oil soluble vitamins?\n\n And most of these vitamins are in the other part, the water soluble vitamins and enzymes.\n\n That's why I like coconut cream.\n\n I don't like coconut oil, unless it's for a medicinal process.\n\n\nYou eat the whole coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAll of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's what I'm saying, yeah?\n\n You're eating the coconut cream.\n\n That's what I do.\n\n I don't have coconut oil, unless there's a problem.\n\n If people want to detox some old oils in their body and old toxins, then eat coconut oil.\n\n Maybe a tablespoon a day, or a tablespoon of olive oil a day or flax oil, but only as medicine.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Fermented Soy \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nFermented whole soybean\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nVery bad?\n\n The soybean is meant for herbivore.\n\n In order for human to digest them, they have to be incredibly processed, there's a poison in them.\n\n If they're germinated, they still are poisonous.\n\n When they are fermented, there is less poison in it, but you still got a high IgG problem with it, and it's still a vegetable.\n\n It takes an herbivore and to digest it.\n\n An herbivore has two and a half times longer digestive tract than we do and has 60,000 times more enzymes to digest the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the protein.\n\n  \nWe may get some starch from that bean, but it's not a good quality for the human body.\n\n \nLet me say one more thing about that.\n\n When you eat those fermented beans, they destroy some of the bacteria in the intestines and it can start forming a lot of gas, cause a lot of gas formation, and it can also cause the blood to get too acidic.\n\n \nCause irritability, cause weight loss, things like that.\n\n Soy sauce is terrible in that way, causes a lot of weight loss or headaches causes, water retention.\n\n It causes weight loss and muscle loss, muscle mass loss, but water retention.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Fibermyalgia, Eggs and Milk \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nFibromyalgia\n\n What?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI don't like her at all?\n\n I won't date her.\n\n\nFibromyalgia is when you have aching everywhere in the body.\n\n That's because toxins are storing in the nerves, in the muscles, in the tendons, everywhere.\n\n To relieve that the best thing to do is just suck eggs and have a little bits of milk at a time, like a half a cup.\n\n So, have a egg one hour the next hour, have a half a cup of milk, skip two hours, an egg next hour, half a cup of milk.\n\n And just keep doing that for a couple of weeks to help relive  it.\n\n You could also have a little honey in that milk.\n\n \nIf you're eating kefir, it's even better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI find that milk really adds on weight though.\n\n That weight just flies on with the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou're drinking too much and you're drinking cold still or not.\n\n\nI rest my case?\n\n  You're hesitating.\n\n I know you're drinking it cold.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDuring the day cold, but at night it's warm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDoesn't matter.\n\n You're putting on the weight when it's cold.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOh, is that right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n Just remember when the milk is cold, goes into the stomach, contracts the stomach, hydrochloric acid does not secrete, does not digest the milk, the lactate or the casein and a lot of the other proteins, and it does not divide and separate the minerals properly.\n\n So, that clumps, gets into the blood.\n\n You can't digest it properly, causes allergic reaction.\n\n The body will store it in the tissues, something toxic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\n⁠How come you never told me that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI did! Dozens of times?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCold kefir is okay right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nCold kefir is okay, it's predigested?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat about water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAny kind of water is bad?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut if you're gonna drink the water, you drink it cold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDoesn't matter?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nHow do you make kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nTwo tablespoons of honey per quart of milk?\n\n You blend that into some of the milk, you pour that back into the quart jar.\n\n\nThen you put it in a cupboard, dark cupboard, and let it sit until it gets thick and you might shake it a couple of times, cause the cream will settle on the top and you want it to all digest together.\n\n So, you may have to shake it a couple of times.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Flowtron Is Bad,  Copper Too High \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nYou won't taste\n\n You can actually drink the water it's that safe.\n\n You keep the copper below.\n\n It's called Flowtron.\n\n I think it's made in Arizona.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI've tested it, it's not good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWe've had it for 20 years.\n\n It's great.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThere is a process where they use just a small bulb.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIt's a thing like this, it's solar powered and then it has a copper coil and it releases the copper and a copper is a wonderful with algae.\n\n What you do is you monitor with a little tester kit you get, and then when it gets strong, above a certain point, you just take that out of the water for a week or two before you're ready to put it back again.\n\n And the water's safe enough that you can drink.\n\n If there were emergency and we all had no water suddenly where Laguna beach was cut off from a water supply, I could drink my pool water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's her opinion.\n\n I don't agree.\n\n I found the coppers too high.\n\n Copper patinas, it rusts in the system, even in small amounts.\n\n So, I don't agree with that one.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nCan you kill a plant by putting too much copper in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYeah, you can?\n\n Absolutely.\n\n But if you put enough.\n\n If you cleaned out your coil and you dumped it on the plant, that would be very toxic.\n\n You have to dispose it.\n\n The coil has a protective thing around, but the water really has no taste, it's wonderful.\n\n Now, I don't say the salt pools aren't as good, but this is very easy, and we've used it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nSalt pools are good to have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, it depends.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Foggy Mind, and Energy Drop, Carbs \n \n \n \n \n### (36) Foot Corn - Lime Juice \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWhat she did\n\n She went to a pedicurist to have the pedicure done, and she had a corn to have that worked on, scraped away as much as possible.\n\n They told her it was a deep root.\n\n I told her to take lime juice and use nothing but water and lime and if you want to use something on your cuticles, you take coconut oil for them put on the cuticles, but no soap in the water.\n\n\nShe let them put soap in the water.\n\n Your lime juice is an antiseptic.\n\n They love to use alcohol while they're cutting and trimming.\n\n Lime juice is your antiseptic.\n\n You just explain all that before you get started.\n\n They're not comfortable with it.\n\n Go to somebody else?\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Growth On Eye. Lime Juice and Coco Crema \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nDo you know about this condition of this little growth in the eye\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhat about them?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI would like to know how to eradicate it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, it depends on is it a stye or is it a wart.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nIt's a growth over the iris?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh, I see.\n\n It grows over the cornea.\n\n\nYou can put some coconut cream in it.\n\n You have to get it very warm, so it's diluted and there are no flakes in it.\n\n There's no pulp in it, and you can put that with just a tiny speck of lime juice in it.\n\n The lime and the coconut cream together you can put in there.\n\n \nYou put it right into the eye.\n\n\nYou can make a mixture of it.\n\n Let's say you have two tablespoons of coconut cream and a drop of lime.\n\n That's all it takes.\n\n Mix that in, take your finger, make sure it's completely dissolved and clear, and then just rub it on the eye and then roll the eye around or you can rub it right onto that spot.\n\n\nAnd you do that once a day.\n\n It usually resolves it within about a year.\n\n They're not easy to get rid of, that's heavy scar tissue.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Hearing Loss, Hot Water Bottles \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nHearing loss\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nPardon.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nHearing loss?\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n\n*Laughs*\n\n\nHearing loss.\n\n My father got mad at me.\n\n I was autistic, so I didn't know what the hell anything was being said anyway.\n\n And he says, I told you to listen to me, he popped both of my eardrums.\n\n So, I lost 60% hearing in one and 40% in the other and now I've got 80% in one and 80% in the other.\n\n\nSo, it does regenerate, but I've never found anything that regenerated it fast, unless you use a hot water bottle near your ear.\n\n Cuz the passages into that network are very finite, so there's not much circulation in there.\n\n The only way you can force more nutrients to heal the eardrum in that area is to put a hot water bottle near that area, and then put a towel over your head and over that ear to generate heat for several hours a night into that area.\n\n\nAnd that will speed as long as you're on a good diet, that will speed it.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Hemeroids \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \n\n \nI was just wondering what you suggest for treating hemorrhoids\n\n I was reading in your book about alkalizing food, but is there anything specific?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nYeah, like I say in the book, take just a thin piece of meat and put it up there?\n\n You might coat it with a little bit of honey before you put it up there.\n\n \nSometimes it doesn't stay up in there, slides in and out.\n\n So, you might wanna make a little, carve a little barbell, a tiny one.\n\n So it's got a plug at both ends.\n\n So, it won't go in and it won't go out.\n\n For one 1/10 people, that's a problem.\n\n You know, my rectum was always so dry I didn't have to worry about that, but some people have very lubricated rectums.\n\n Most people don't.\n\n So, that's the best thing you can do.\n\n Also, cabbage juice is good for that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nMy brother just finished the chemo two weeks ago, and he's had some symptoms of mucositis, it's excruciating pain.\n\n \nIs there anything that you recommend that he could do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, the chemo's coming out the mucus membranes, so he needs to eat a lot of milkshakes to produce a lot of mucus could get that out of his system?\n\n Cuz as long as that chemical is staying in his mucus membranes, there's going to be pain, severe pain.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nSo, can he have raw milk.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, he's just scared to have anything like raw milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nThat's what he has to have, but with eggs, not raw milk alone.\n\n It'll dry him out.\n\n It won't help.\n\n He needs to have eggs.\n\n He needs to have ice cream is what he needs to have, raw ice cream formula, not frozen.\n\n So half and half, milk and cream, honey and eggs, So, it should be one third cream, one third milk, one third eggs.\n\n \nSo, half a cup of each and about a tablespoon, two tablespoons of the honey.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \nI have a sugar addiction.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nYou have a what?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \nI have a sugar addiction?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWelcome to the club.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \n*Laughs* \n.\n \n \n \n### (40) High Liver \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWell, liver's more concentrated in protein\n\n That can cause some heavy detoxifications of the pancreas, the liver, and the brain.\n\n When you have that concentration of high meat of, of protein, usually it's a better balance if you're using fat with the protein.\n\n So, it's a little bit more balanced and regulated, but when you've got a concentrated protein like liver, you're asking for, and you're eating a lot of it you're asking for detoxification.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, we shouldn't eat that stuff in the old jars, straight out of the jar.\n\n We should give it some time?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, give it a few cycles of opening it with the air getting into it again?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) High Meat \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nNow the high meat, the reason it works for depression and terrible moods is because the E coli, the last stage of digestion in your body, that E coli breaks down and has the final digestion of fats and proteins\n\n It puts it in very micro, finite solutions that feed the brain and nervous system.\n\n\nWhen you have poor E coli, you'll have depression all the time.\n\n People who colonics and enemas, when they do the colonic and enema, they rush over 2 billion E coli into their blood streams, but then they're washing the E coli from their intestines out.\n\n So, then they have to keep doing the Enemas or colonics to be able to rush the E coli into the system to be able to feed the brain and the nervous system, and it is a trap.\n\n \nSo, if you eat high meat, the bacteria in the meat predigest those in the same way the e-coli into finite molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n That's why when you eat high meat, does everybody know what high meat is.\n\n Good?\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI don't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh, you don't.\n\n High meat is when you take meat, you chop it up to small pieces, you put it in a jar and you let it start rotting.\n\n Decaying.\n\n The bacteria in the meat will start decaying itself, digesting itself.\n\n And when that happens, then it will cause- if you're psychotic, neurotic, doesn't no matter what it is, depressed.\n\n It will resolve that in 10 to 20 minutes after eating the high meat, it happens in so far 196 cases out of 200, even from the first time of using it.\n\n\nSo, it's a very good thing to use if you're depressed.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nCould you get a psychiatrist to prescribe that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n You can get a few.\n\n A few heard my lecture and tried it with some of their patients, and it worked every time they tried it, so they do recommend it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHow long does it have to be.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you make it out of the refrigerator, I usually tell people, so it doesn't stink up their houses and so they don't have to be as diligent?\n\n\nThey put in the refrigerator, they take it out every three to four days outside, open it up, put new air in it, screw it back on and put it back in your refrigerator, and that'll take about 14 to 21 days to be ready.\n\n \nIf you want it ready quickly, don't put it in the refrigerator, put it in a dark cupboard, take it out every two days and then put new air in it, and put it back in the cupboard.\n\n If you go three, four days, it's gonna start gassing and stinking up your cupboard, and that hangs around.\n\n That's why I say don't open it in your house.\n\n Don't open it and eat it in your house cuz it will hang in the drapes, the rugs and everything.\n\n People are gonna come in your house and say, what's dead in here.\n\n\nIt's dying?\n\n What's rotting in her.\n\n Are you dying?\n\n Do you have cancer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, how long does it take when it's in the cupboard?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt takes about 10 days?\n\n 10 to, to 12 days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nIs it dangerous to eat too much of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI have a fellow who was about six foot tall, about 240 pounds?\n\n Started on the diet, in about a year and a half, he was always impressed.\n\n He became a landscape artist because he hated people, most antisocial besides me when I was younger and so ill, he was the most antisocial person that I ever knew.\n\n Finally, after a year and a half, I got him to try the high meat and it worked for him in 10 minutes.\n\n\nSo, over the next six months, he adapted to eat only high meat.\n\n So, he eats two pounds of high meat a day.\n\n And the last time I went and did a workshop in his area.\n\n He had three girls.\n\n Now he's only about a 4.\n\n8 or a 5 in the looks department, and he's still a big bear of a guy, but he became such a happy person.\n\n\nHe got a great personality.\n\n Funny as can be.\n\n I mean, he could be a standup comedian, be better than the top out there.\n\n And he had three number 10 girlfriends at the same workshop together.\n\n That's charm.\n\n So, that's the extreme.\n\n So, he only eats high meat, two pounds a day.\n\n He doesn't eat any fresh meat.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nDoes he have bad breath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, he doesn't?\n\n\nI think your body adapts to it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nBut his house smells *Laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, he has a shed that he does it all.\n\n Separate refrigerator, separate shed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs that mainly with just red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, it all depends on what kind of meat you need?\n\n I do mainly fish, that causes my breath to stink, but I just deal with it.\n\n I need to the fish because all the chemotherapy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWith a lot of high meat with people that don't have any condition, like the person mentioned, can that cause detoxication symptoms.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI can't say that it does because in only about 5% of the cases do people go into diarrhea and vomit after having the high meat and that's a lower incidence of vomit and high diarrhea on a normal basis?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Homogonization \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nA lot of people want to know what homogenization is\n\n Homogenization is when they take the milk and they press it through a very, very fine sieve with high pressure.\n\n So, it splits the fat molecule and when the fat molecule splits, it absorbs all the solids in the milk, so then it never separates.\n\n The cream never separates.\n\n That's homogenization.\n\n\nHowever, when the fat molecule absorbs all of those solids they're Indigestible.\n\n So, you're going to be drinking milk all the day long, pasteurized milk, never gonna be satisfied.\n\n That's the way with any processed food.\n\n There's no nutrient value.\n\n So, you're always going to be hungry.\n\n\nIt's all criminal.\n\n Any way they make food it's criminal because there's no nutrient value, no true nutrient value in it.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Honey Doesnt Act As Antibacterial In Milk \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn't\n\n It doesn't act as an antibacterial in milk.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and mainly the bulgaricus would be more active, that's to break down the fats and the proteins.\n\n\nSo, that's why it becomes bitter or tart even.\n\n When you put the honey in it, it encourages the acidophilus to grow.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and bulgaricus, but it doesn't destroy it completely.\n\n\nI'll just reblend it and then drink it that way, unless it's too acidic.\n\n If it starts causing my mouth to get a little stingy and burn or my tongue to get sore, then I'll just separate it and make cheese with it.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Honey Okay On Weihgt Loss, May Cause Protein Deficiency \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nIf it is, then you have some honey, honey's okay\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhen you're trying to lose weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAbsolutely?\n\n Honey, as long as it's not heated over 93 degrees is mainly enzyme.\n\n When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it predigests it, and adds an insulin like substance that converts the honey into mainly enzymes for digesting, mainly proteins, secondarily fat.\n\n\nSo, it will help you break down your fat in your body, honey.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, how much should you be using.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, not too much because it can cause a protein deficiency at the same time?\n\n So, you need, let's say a half a cup of day.\n\n No more than half a cup a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat vegetables juice do you recommend.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDo something light that doesn't cause detoxification?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Honey, Sugaraaddiciton, Weight Loss \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nCause I had some raw honey today and it made me want more\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nGo ahead, pig out on honey, it's okay.\n\n I've eaten up to a quart of honey a day, but you can't do that every day, but pig out on it for a while.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThat's what made me, I ate a lot of bad carbs and whatnot and I gained body fat, which I didn't want to do, and now that weight planning we're talking about when you're losing all that weight.\n\n Are you losing muscle weight, are you losing water weight.\n\n How are you getting rid of all that weight?\n\n What is it exactly that's being lost?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nFrom eating the honey?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nFrom eating those eggs?\n\n The weight plan suggested.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, you're losing mainly fat, but everything that goes along with it, everything that that fat is contained, all the poisons in that fat will be leaving your body too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThat was like a good two years worth of bad sugars that I was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, well, you've got a lot in there to remove and you may get lots of acne from it.\n\n You may get some rashes, you may get some hives, just follow the things that it says in the book for that, because mainly fungus will break that down in your body.\n\n\nBacteria don't feed well on high carbs, high sugars, nor do parasites, except for the tapeworm.\n\n It's hard to get a tapeworm in this country.\n\n Everything's so poisoned in our system.\n\n Tapeworms are very sensitive.\n\n You kill those so easily.\n\n You can eat a half of an onion and kill a tapeworm.\n\n\nSo, eat as much honey as you like, but if you wanna slow some of that down so that you're not just taking honey, have honey and butter mixture.\n\n\nYou can get it at Whole Foods, Rawsome.\n\n You get a better quality at Rawsome Do you know what Rawsome is.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nNo?\n\n I'll look it up online.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, you won't find it anywhere.\n\n 665 Rose Avenue.\n\n Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nCan you eat honey and butter for nerve pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHow long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nFew minutes?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nI mean, for weeks or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh, to have honey and butter?\n\n Until it stops, until the pain stops?\n\n With that condition already that old, a year and a half, but still, that's better than never going away.\n\n Most of people have it for life cuz the doctors don't wanna repair it.\n\n Pharmaceutical houses don't want it repaired.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHow often do you do the honey and butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOften as you have pain, as often as you feel when you need relief from pain?\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Hot Rubs and EMFs \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nYou advised me instead of doing the sauna to get a hot tub\n\n So, I've done some research and found one that wasn't too expensive, but now you just blew my period.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's got ozone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYes.\n\n Most of them come with the ozone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut you can have them don't put the ozone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIt holds 120 gallons of water.\n\n\nSo, tell me how to treat that, so we can take a bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou've got a problem with that unit.\n\n You've got the motor under the unit, in the unit.\n\n You've gotta have that motor three feet away from you.\n\n It generates EMFs.\n\n If you're gonna be sitting in it, and you have that generator on heating the whole time and your jets going the whole time, that EMFs gonna hit you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs that guy willing to work with us.\n\n He emailed you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, he just emailed me the information, all the stuff that you just told me, but I haven't asked him what he will do to change it.\n\n But see, he sells the whole unit.\n\n The whole unit's intact.\n\n It's made the way it is, not gonna work.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat am I to get then.\n\n I mean, the other spas are the same damn thing?\n\n The motor is on the bottom.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou just have to get a separate pool guy to make a separate compartment and put extra hoses.\n\n So, it won't be all contained in one.\n\n Take the whole motor unit out, anything that generates an electrical charge.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDo you know anybody that has one that can do this that we can work with them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI had someone build mine?\n\n I told them how I wanted it built, and they built it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nHow far away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, I've got mine 10 feet?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nYeah, but this EMF from a two horse motor.\n\n Come on?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's only three feet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nHave it three feet away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou gotta be three feet away?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOkay.\n\n That's one issue.\n\n Now.\n\n I mean, I didn't even think of that issue, but okay.\n\n You were talking about that they have an ozone generator in the unit.\n\n Now you're saying that's no good.\n\n So, how am I gonna clean the water to go in it every night, instead of using my bathtub.\n\n Cause I wanna get well, but I need to have that temperature hot, so I don't have to do the bath all the time is what you told me?\n\n So I can do it six, seven days a week.\n\n I mean, I'm trying to make this easy for myself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's not gonna be easy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWell, I'm trying to at least have it there and available.\n\n I mean, you told me to get the hot tub, so I'm trying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI said, you can get a hot tub, but you're going to have to rearrange it, depending upon the hot tub.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAlright.\n\n So, tell me how to do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI just told you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOkay.\n\n You put the motor aside, but you didn't tell me how do I clean the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, ozone doesn't clean the water?\n\n It just keeps the algae from growing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nTell me what we put in it so we can keep the water in there for four to six months and not have the pipes have some kind of film on it or whatever we have to worry about.\n\n I don't know anything about this so.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou'd have to have an electrical chlorinator.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, you're saying that's the only thing that would work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you want it small and compact, that's the only way it's going to work?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nDoes that create an EMF field.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, the electrical chlorinator isn't right there?\n\n It goes through a system.\n\n So, the water goes through that system where the charge is and sends the water back in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo that has to be separate also.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah?\n\n Anything that has the motor you're gonna have to.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAnd how far away should it be.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nShould be about three feet, at least three feet?\n\n The only way you'll know for sure is IF you get a EMF field meter and you test it and see how far it goes to where it's zero.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOkay.\n\n And that electric coordinator is going to be sufficient not to use any other, I don't know, I've talked to pool guys and it's either, they say the ozone works 80% and then you have to shock the system with either hydrogen peroxide or some kind of nature 2 enzymes or non chlorinated.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThis is getting way too complex, and this is too complex of an issue to take up here.\n\n So, you'll have to call me for the rest of it.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\n Can I ask you about a jacuzzi tub when it comes to that, you're not supposed to use a jacuzzi tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nJacuzzi tub's fine?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nWhere's the motor on a jacuzzi tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nUsually it's about a foot and a half, two feet away?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\nAnd that's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah.\n\n Well, what you could do is turn it on while you have a low amount of water in it and see where your EMF field is.\n\n If it's at one corner, you just keep your feet away from that edge.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhy not turn it off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's true, but some people like the jets, the air jets, but that would be the mistake to do, turn it off?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCan I get a regular hot tub maybe and you just turn it off when you're in it.\n\n Seems like the simplest solution?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut then when you have to heat it every few minutes to keep that temperature regulated, you're going to be in it.\n\n\nIf you get out it, then your body's gonna cool down, it won't work.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Hot Sprigns Are Good \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n \n\n \nWonderful\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nWould that count as a lymphatic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, you have to check the temperature?\n\n It fluctuates because it's from the underground thermal pool and that even adjusts.\n\n So, you just check the temperature.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nWould that count as a lymphatic bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWhat?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nAt Glen Ivy?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nIf you stay in for an hour to an hour and a half.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nDo they let you put your coconut cream in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n*Laughs* No at Glen Ivy?\n\n They have several hot tubs there that have no toxic minerals.\n\n Your skin's just gonna get dry, so take the coconut cream with you and put it on your skin several times throughout the day to oil the skin.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nSo, then you have to dress up warm and walk.\n\n  \nWell, you're not gonna be walking for that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nWell, you can, you can leave?\n\n You've got your pass.\n\n You go take a walk around the area and come back in.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \nYou can dress up warm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nYeah, you can do that?\n\n Yeah, you can do that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nI wanna tell anyone who's going there because most are too friendly to even ask, but when I go there it's too cool, which has happened twice recently.\n\n You just ask the attendant to come and check the temperature of the pool.\n\n I said it was 101°, and he, he said, \"Oh no, it's not, it's 103°\".\n\n So, I said, \"No, it's not\".\n\n He came and checked and it was 101°.\n\n So, he can put it up.\n\n So, they will do it cause I was very nice.\n\n I was very sweet to them.\n\n I said, you know, I've come all the way from San Diego and it's only 101°, and I have to have it for my healing.\n\n He said, \"Okay\".\n\n And then all the other people complained it's too hot.\n\n Then they don't like it at 103°, but they will do it because they advertise it at 103° - 104°.\n\n \nSo, you just have to be nice to them and they'll come and do it at the beginning of the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nYeah, theirs is a controlled heat.\n\n They have the thermal that comes out of the ground, but then they filter the water and then control the heat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \nThey've got two heat sources, one cooler and one hot.\n\n They both come from mineral.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \nSo, hot and cold are good for the body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \nYeah, just don't stay cold too long?\n\n Stay in the cold maybe three minutes at a time.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (48) How Long After Startign Diet To Have High Meat \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nNot really raw yet\n\n How long would you say is like a minimum to wait to try this part.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAbout a month?\n\n What she asked was I haven't been on the raw food diet.\n\n How long would I have to wait before I can have the high meat, start taking high meat.\n\n And I said about a month on the diet?\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (49) How Much Coconut Cream Per Day \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWhat I said was you have to use coconut cream to help dissolve those minerals and eating the lubrication formula will keep you lubricated\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat I'm asking is how much coconut cream would you recommend then.\n\n Cuz I don't really eat very much of that for you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nFor you I would recommend six ounces a day.\n\n You're 6' 4''.\n\n Yeah.\n\n You could have more, you could probably have up to eight ounces a day.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) How Much Meat \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWere you eating meat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh yes, absolutely?\n\n Gosh.\n\n Yes, I have to cuz I wouldn't heal properly.\n\n I wouldn't have enough protein.\n\n So, I was eating somewhere around about a pound and a quarter to a pound and a half a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nJust beef.\n\n What kind of meat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, I probably ate 50% chicken, about 20% fish and about 30% beef, buffalo?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\nI have a question about that.\n\n How you keep yourself from going into shock.\n\n How does anybody handle something like something like that, where you completely shook up and you kept your wits about you completely, but a normal person wouldn't?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, it's just that I made up my mind that unless I kept my witts, they were gonna do anything they wanted to me.\n\n\nSo, I just wouldn't allow myself to get into a state of lack of control, lack of awareness consciousness.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\nSo, what's your normal person do if they get like bad news or a shock or something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBreathe heavily?\n\n And say, hey, it's part of life.\n\n It is.\n\n It's just part of life.\n\n \nI wish that I'd had a camera to shoot all this cuz it was amazing.\n\n I was shocked.\n\n I mean really, all from this whole area like this, not only the skin was gone, the muscle and part of the bone was shaved.\n\n For that to seal up in two weeks was amazing.\n\n I mean, it was still very red and tender, but some of the bone had grown back.\n\n Not all of it.\n\n It's still partially gone, and all of the muscle in the skin had grown back, even though it wasn't mature flesh yet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDid you breathe heavy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh gosh, yes?\n\n Absolutely.\n\n Deep, slow breaths.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) How Much Milk Per Day \n \n**[2007],[Lewis]**\n\n\n\nHow much milk should I drink a day\n\n Any barometer?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, that's up to you?\n\n I drink two quarts a day in the summertime, maybe, a quart, a little over a quart in the winter, but I don't use heat, except when patients come.\n\n My house is freezing cold, so I just bundle up cause I'm in the mountains in Malibu near the coastline.\n\n So,.\n\n it gets pretty cold up there, even hails and snows up there\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) How Much Milk Per Day2 \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nThere's a notebook that I was reading\n\n You talked about the guy who started Mayo clinic used to recommend anywhere from 2 to 10 quarts of raw milk a day for people.\n\n Do you recommend a higher amount than you say 2 to 4 quarts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou don't have that value of milk like he had in those days?\n\n\nCause he was doing that in the twenties and thirties and the value of milk was much, much better back then.\n\n So, I think that I think that's too much.\n\n \nI use two quarts a day, sometimes two and a half.\n\n And during the winter I'll use less cuz I wanna stay warmer.\n\n\nStay warmer by keeping the H20 level down in the blood.\n\n The thicker the blood is the warmer you stay.\n\n So, I eat more cheese in the winter and less milk.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) How To Check Temperature \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nYou can have a thermometer\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nThey're not very accurate, the one I've been looking at.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, get one that's for cooking.\n\n What I use is a temperature one that you take the temperature on your tongue.\n\n Those are usually pretty accurate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThe swimming pool ones are not accurate, they're often 2° lower than what they should be.\n\n So, you can't go by it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, you can't go by that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAre cooking thermometer that reliable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nUnless you used them for cooking, they will be reliable, unless you've used them for cooking?\n\n Once they've gone through a high temperature change, they go off about 2° or 3°.\n\n\nEven up to 6°, 7°.\n\n Depends upon it.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (54) How To Increase Chi \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nCertain forms of martial arts dealing with energy, they call it chi\n\n Do you have any kind of diet or recommendation in terms of developing chi and unrestricting the flow of chi.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, that's just keeping it balanced as possible, and following the two diets that I've recommended in the recipe book?\n\n One with two meat meals a day, one with three meat meals a day.\n\n\nIf you follow that, your chi will increase faster than anything else will do it.\n\n I have quite a few martial artist masters on the diet, and let me tell you what they, where they went in two years it took them 20 years to achieve what they achieved in two years on the diet.\n\n\nSo, they had to work 20 years to get where they got in just two years on the diet.\n\n Does that make sense.\n\n They worked 20 years before they went on the diet to get to a certain place, and to get that much farther advanced, that only took them two years on the diet?\n\n \nAlso, a lot of the Scientologists who were going through different kinds of exercises.\n\n I had one fellow that had tried to get into auditing for six years and his levels, they wouldn't even take him.\n\n Three months on the diet he was an audit.\n\n Just like that three months on the diet, his level evened out.\n\n\nSo, he was able to go into auditing.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nAuditing, you mean counting numbers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo?\n\n No, no.\n\n  if you don't know anything about Scientology, don't even think about it.\n\n Counselling.\n\n His metabolism was so off, so low.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Injury \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I'm gonna talk about, I had a nasty accident again in Thailand 13 weeks ago\n\n Three and a half years ago, I had an accident in a car.\n\n Somebody ran into the side of this SUV I was a passenger in and flipped it over a few times.\n\n Broke my clavicle, two ribs, and collarbone, and I was back to making love with my girlfriend five days later.\n\n So, accidents can't keep me down, broken bones.\n\n However, this last one, I used to own three motorcycles when I was a kid, and when somebody ran me off the road in Los Angeles on one of the freeways, I decided to get rid of them.\n\n When a truck purposely ran me off.\n\n**[unclear]**\n to had take a week vacation, and I rented a big Harley while I was there.\n\n I didn't have that Harley for two hours, two and a half hours, and I was going on a busy street only about 18 miles an hour, 20 miles an hour maximum, and there was no intersection, no driveway, no crosswalk and these five tourists jumped right out in the street in front of me.\n\n So, it was either hit them and take a chance on killing two of them, cuz it was a pretty big bike.\n\n It's about 350 pounds or so, and spending my life in jail in Thailand cuz when you hit somebody and kill somebody in Thailand, it doesn't matter who's at fault.\n\n \nSo, I decided bury it to the pavement.\n\n So, I buried it on my leg, so when I hit the pavement, of course, the asphalt pulled my rump back this way and damaged my sciatica, and then the bike took my leg that way.\n\n It popped it, I thought it was gone.\n\n I thought my leg was off and separated at the knee.\n\n It hurt so badly, and it took me a minute, and about 15 seconds to get the guts to look down to see if my leg was still there.\n\n And it was still there, and the bike stopped about three feet from them and they just stood there and then they walked away.\n\n\nThey just stood there in the road and walked away.\n\n And this one Thai lady, probably about 36, 37 years old, she saw it, she came and stayed with me and I stayed on the street for 20 minutes cuz the pain was so bad.\n\n I wasn't gonna move, and everybody said to call the ambulance.\n\n  And I said, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n I'm not going to any hospital.\n\n At least not in that condition because it took all of the skin off of here all the way down, all the way back.\n\n I was in shorts and t-shirt, so it took all of the skin all the way up here too.\n\n So, there was no way I was going to go to a hospital and have them put iodine on it and give me an injection to settle me down cuz I was refusing everything.\n\n\nSo, it took me about 35 to 40 minutes to settle the pain down where I got on a taxi and there the taxis were just cutout pickup trucks with a frame on top and two metal benches on the side.\n\n So, I took a taxi, I lied on the floor.\n\n The Thai lady took care of arranging, getting a couple Thai motor bike driver taxis to take my motorcycle back to the hotel with me following the taxi, the other kind of taxi.\n\n\nSo, I got back to the hotel.\n\n I had lime juice and I had coconut cream and honey there.\n\n So, I cleaned all the wounds.\n\n Of course, with the asphalt, there were chunks of asphalt all over, so black all over.\n\n So, took the coconut, and lime juice and cleaned it.\n\n \nCuz lime juice, let me give you an example.\n\n You see this little piece right here.\n\n That's a piece of the asphalt coming.\n\n That was three months ago, but when you put the lime juice on it, it surrounds it.\n\n If you don't do that, then your body uses phenomenal amounts of white blood cells.\n\n And then that's called an infection.\n\n It will keep pussing and blistering, but the lime juice stops all that.\n\n\nIt will bring it to the skin eventually and just keep coming off in a slight scab.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, any kind of fall is required lime juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\n So you wanna do it with any kind of a wound, cut, anything like that?\n\n Use lime juice?\n\n Lemon juice is a bacterial, it incites bacterial activity.\n\n That's why they use it for marinating.\n\n It helps degeneration, it helps break down.\n\n It helps predigestion of foods.\n\n So, you don't wanna put that on your wounds cuz it'll just eat away your own body, lime juice seals it.\n\n It seals the toxins.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDoes it hurt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh, it stings like hell?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nYou take a lime and just rub it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI took the lime, squeezed it and rubbed it in and I mean vigorously and there was no skin and no muscle here?\n\n It scaled some of the bone away.\n\n\nThis bone, you see this bone's a little larger than this one now.\n\n And it took some of this bone away when I went down on the pavement.\n\n Shaved some of the ankle bone off on the pavement.\n\n So, the tendon that was over the ankle got scraped off, so it buckled up on both sides.\n\n\nThe two tendons here, you've got two rope tendons on either side of the knee.\n\n This one ripped this way and this one ripped this way.\n\n So, they were buckled up like this on the ends.\n\n So, I got back to the hotel.\n\n I washed everything out and put coconut cream in it, on everything, and then put honey on it.\n\n \nAnd then the leg looked so bad and was in too much pain that I thought there was dislocated.\n\n So, I said, well, call a taxi.\n\n Let's go to the hospital, and I wanna have it reset.\n\n So, they called the hospital and the ambulance came, four attendants take me the hospital, one driver and it cost me $12.\n\n50.\n\n The price difference is astounding.\n\n So, I got there and the intern freaked out when he saw my leg and my body, I wouldn't let them touch any of my wounds.\n\n\nI said, I've already cleaned it.\n\n They don't see any iodine on it or any methylate, so they think that I'm nuts.\n\n And I told them I cleaned it with the with the lime juice and the coconut cream and honey.\n\n And it was fine.\n\n I didn't need anything else.\n\n The intern was, you know, he is probably only about 27, 28 years old, and he wasn't gonna touch this leg.\n\n\nAnd so he called an Osteo surgeon.\n\n Osteo surgeon came, but he said, Osteo surgeon isn't gonna do anything without an x-ray.\n\n I kind of figured that at that point.\n\n So, I said, you get two x-rays, one shot this way, one shot that way and that's it.\n\n You have to make your decision from those.\n\n\nSo, by the time the Osteo surgeon got there, I had the x-rays done.\n\n I have them right here and you've got a big tibia bone right here, mines about as big as my fist, and it goes down all the way down to the ankle, and then you've got another bone that's smaller.\n\n It goes on the back side, back inner side on both legs.\n\n\nSo, that tibia, the big bone, was split in two with about a quarter of an inch or more in the back open.\n\n Plus the tibia goes up like this and the femur sits down in it like this, it broke the top off.\n\n Other splintered pieces of fragments of that cartilage were in the knee joint.\n\n \nSo, the Osteo surgeon said, there's no way you're ever gonna walk again, unless we do surgery.\n\n You've got bone fragments there, it's gonna stab the nerves in the knee joint, and you're just not gonna be able to put any weight on it.\n\n He said, of course, I can't put a cast on it unless you let me operate.\n\n I said, I don't wanna cast anyway, when I was nine years old, I had a ladder collapse and I shattered my heel cap and I had a cast for 12 weeks.\n\n I was going nuts.\n\n Cause you can't scratch it.\n\n I mean, I would take hammers and hit it.\n\n It was scratching itching so badly, and baths, no showers, anything like that.\n\n So, everything was sponge bathing.\n\n And that was no fun.\n\n I love water.\n\n So, I said, I don't want cast anyway.\n\n And he goes, *imitation*.\n\n\nAnd I said, I elect not to accept the surgery, but I'll be back in six weeks if I can't walk.\n\n And he goes, *imitation*, thinks I'm out of my mind.\n\n So, the hospital drove me back free of charge, back to the hotel.\n\n So, I called my girlfriend who lived in the next town, and she knows my diet and everything.\n\n So, I called her the next day.\n\n I had enough food coming from Bangkok to make it through Saturday, probably part of Sunday.\n\n\nSo, she came on Saturday, brought, bought all the food that I needed.\n\n The coconut cream is over there is easy.\n\n They make it everywhere, everybody eats it.\n\n So, she brought all the food that I needed, and then she stayed with me.\n\n I had two, that one woman.\n\n  and my girlfriend stayed with me 24 hours a day for two weeks.\n\n\nAnd I mean, I was in pain constantly.\n\n Plus my girlfriend got a wheelchair, a wheelchair there, a good wheelchair cost $125, here it cost a thousand or more.\n\n So, got me a wheelchair.\n\n \nSo, they were taking cold coconut cream.\n\n We'd leave in the refrigerator and that's the only thing I would allow cold on the leg.\n\n I have some hot water bottles.\n\n And of course they went under, around the legs, different areas.\n\n The places where I had no muscle, the skin as well as the muscle was gone here and here and in here, I put thin strips of meat to seal that over.\n\n And I took gauze in all the areas where I put the honey and the coconut cream.\n\n I only used the lime juice for two days.\n\n Then after that no more lime juice, then after that was just coconut cream and honey, and then the gauze and the gauze, I would soak in coconut cream, then take the raw butter to put a thin layer on that, so the wounds would never dry.\n\n \nAnd if they never dry you, they won't scar and then you'll replace the tissue very quickly.\n\n So, in exactly two weeks, all of the skin had completely replaced itself.\n\n Couldn't even see that any skin was gone from here.\n\n I do have some scars still left here, little bubbles of scars here and here you can see there's a little bit of scar there.\n\n Here there's a little bit, you can see it's still red here and down on the ankle.\n\n You can see here part of this bone that was gone, all this was gone.\n\n So, that's the only scarring left.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nProbably goes away after a while.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt will go.\n\n That'll go away.\n\n It will probably take about a year and it will be gone and you can see the knee is still larger than the other one.\n\n And I can't straighten it all the way yet, but interesting thing that happened within a few days, all of the muscle in this thigh disappears.\n\n So, I had this hanging flesh on this bone, this femur bone and all of that went to make a cast.\n\n And the cast came from here down to the end of my toes.\n\n And you could hit it.\n\n It was like a hard cast inside under my skin.\n\n So, the body formed its own cast.\n\n However, when I tried to lift my leg, it still hurt very badly here.\n\n The tendons grew back in one week, but the pain didn't.\n\n \nIn fact, I don't think that I had much pain from the broken bone.\n\n What I had the pain was from those tendons that had ripped and those tendons, this one still aches a little bit.\n\n Sometimes when I awaken in the morning, not when I walk, but when I waken in the morning.\n\n So, the women were very nice, the one girl slept on the floor, they're pretty used to that there.\n\n\nAnd then my girlfriend of course slept in bed with me, but they would, anytime I would moan, they'd be up and rubbing my leg, just very attentive.\n\n Fabulous to have two people helping me, so nicely like that.\n\n \nBut the pain was so excruciating.\n\n I spent a lot of the time in the bathtub.\n\n Because when I hit the pavement and bruised my sciatica, my sciatica swelled about this big, cause I went down with a 350 pound bike and hit the pavement.\n\n So, it was pretty bad.\n\n So, I could only sleep like this with pillows under this, with hot water bottles on the side of it, towels draped over it.\n\n So, this leg was up on towels and I had to sleep on this side.\n\n Well, you can only sleep so long on one side of your body, so I'd have to get into the bathtub.\n\n So, I'd have to use the crutches to get to the wheelchair, the wheelchair, to get to the bathroom, the crutches, to get from the door into the bathtub, and the ladies lifted my leg up into the bathtub as I sat on the edge of the bathtub.\n\n \nSo, that went on for about two weeks, and then I was okay.\n\n I was able to get around on crutches.\n\n Didn't have to use the wheelchair very much, but in that second week, I had some computer problems and I still have to work, so I will work a few hours at a time on my computer and I had some computer difficulties.\n\n So I had to go to a computer store in that town wheeling me and these two Thai ladies are telling everybody because both of them had been in motorbike accidents and had huge scars from where they had been in accidents.\n\n Mine much worse than theirs.\n\n Mine was all sealed over already and you know, barely noticeable after a week.\n\n And this one, it took two weeks and this, it took two weeks.\n\n One on the ankle took two weeks.\n\n \nSo, they're going around telling everybody lime juice, coconut cream and honey.\n\n They stop anybody because they couldn't believe that an old man, 60 years old could heal that quickly from that bad of an accident.\n\n And they thought that I was crazy for not having the doctors take care of my leg too.\n\n And then after two weeks I was getting around, so I let the one girl go and then my girlfriend stayed with me for another month.\n\n\nSo, I pretty much stayed in the hotel room up until the third week, and then the third week I decided the leg needed some exercise and I couldn't walk on it yet, still too much pain.\n\n However, the pain wasn't excruciating, it was bad, but not excruciating after that point.\n\n So I started going into the swimming pool at the hotel.\n\n\nThey agreed to lower the chlorine level and all of that, but after five days I started getting the swimmer's ear aches and the sore throat and the sinus problems and the headaches.\n\n So, then I decided that I had to go across the road to the ocean or the bay, they have a gulf there where I was.\n\n So, I had to walk on crutches down these stairs that were about probably a hundred stairs to get down to it.\n\n So, I'd have my crutches going all the way down the stairs and then I'd have to walk on the crutches through the sand out to the ocean.\n\n Then I had to put my crutches down and hop into the ocean far enough to get there, but it was a pretty shallow area.\n\n \nSo, I would get up to about this level and I would go a mile.\n\n I would walk a mile, exercising the leg.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nWalk in the ocean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWalk in the ocean?\n\n Yeah.\n\n So, they didn't have big waves cause it was a gulf and it was pretty quiet.\n\n I mean if it storms you might have some big waves, or big boats come by.\n\n\nSo, I would exercise two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening to get the leg moving and make sure it was okay.\n\n One time, something like a jellyfish, you step on those things and your foot goes down and down.\n\n This one went in and they had to pull it back out and it popped the leg apart again.\n\n So, that was hell.\n\n That was after about four weeks.\n\n So then I had another two days of excruciating pain there, and then I just made sure I touched ahead of that foot before I stepped that foot forward every other time I walked out there that only happened one time, but I did find a couple of those things that I would've stepped into had I not taken the time to check it.\n\n \nAnd then after about six weeks, I threw the crutches away and started walking almost painlessly.\n\n And then after six and a half weeks, I got on a plane and came back and, this is it, it's 13 weeks as of last night.\n\n They said I'd never walk again without surgery.\n\n What I did to help the bone dissolve those fragments.\n\n I used three quarters of a cup of pineapple, half a cup of coconut cream and a half a cup of honey, blended those together and put it in a cup of milk and had that and had cheese.\n\n \nI would have about eight weight ounces of cheese, which is a slice of cheese about like this, like you get in a package of cheese and I eat one of those a day and about, almost a liter of my pineapple, coconut cream and honey and milk mix.\n\n\nSo, the minerals in the cheese will help restore minerals in my body quickly to handle this.\n\n I knew that all of that muscle had disappeared and I just had flesh over it because my body needed all the nutrients to make that cast on its own.\n\n But within two weeks after the cast had been made, which was by the end of the first week, and then two weeks after that on the third week, the cast started disappearing from the foot and in this area and in this area, and in this area.\n\n\nIt's still here.\n\n This is still pretty much hardened cast right here.\n\n If you feel this, you can feel softness around.\n\n If you feel this, you'll see, it's still hard like a cast around there.\n\n The whole leg was like that.\n\n So, this is the only area where it's still slightly cast, and I can still move it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nIt's amazing how the body helps you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you know what to eat, the body is extraordinary to know what to do.\n\n So, the pineapple helps bone rebuild.\n\n Also, the pineapple with the coconut cream helps dissolve bone tissue if your body needs to do it, it can use it for either way.\n\n So, that's how I did it so quickly.\n\n\nSo, I did that every day for two weeks.\n\n Then after that, I just mainly ate cheese and honey together and cheese with everything, but mainly cheese and honey to utilize the minerals.\n\n So, that's an excellent supplement is cheese and honey together, but the cheese and the honey have to be in the mouth together to make it work.\n\n \nIf you have cheese by itself or another with honey in it, the honey is already absorbed by the other food and utilized with the other food and won't necessarily do much with the cheese.\n\n So, the honey and the cheese have to be together in the mouth for you to digest it.\n\n\nOtherwise, the cheese mainly acts as a sponge to attract heavy metals and other toxic substances out of the nerves, nervous system, the blood stream and the lymphatic system as they weed their way through the digestive tract.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Kefir Grains Arent Natural \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nKefir grains had been washed a dozen times\n\n They are nothing natural anymore.\n\n They're an entity amongst themselves and they will interfere with your own bacterial environment in your intestines.\n\n So, if you use the bacteria in the milk to predigested itself, along with the honey.\n\n It's the natural bacteria that's fresh from an animal and it's natural, and it will help your own bacterial environment.\n\n The grains will interfere.\n\n You'll it'll digest the milk for you, but it's not going to help you improve your digestion.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Marinating Meat Orange,lime,lem,grapefruit \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\n I marinate my fish in lime juice\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut I've told you many times, lime is an antibacterial.\n\n So, don't do it's.\n\n Lemon is the thing to marinate, once in a while you can do lime juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDoes lemon or lime juice ruin the teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, neither will ruin the teeth, unless you're eating them too much and you don't have enough fat?\n\n Okay.\n\n Okay.\n\n I have a beef.\n\n Okay.\n\n Something about that.\n\n Yes.\n\n I have found be order to ask you this, \nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee#2]**\n\nYes?\n\n\nI have found that by adding half orange to half lemon, it doesn't whiten the meat with the chicken or fish, so I can leave it there longer and it doesn't go all that quite horrible as if it's been broken down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's fine.\n\n I marinate sometimes in grapefruit juice.\n\n**[Attendee#2]**\n\nYes.\n\n It's much better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nGrapefruit juice in fish is phenomenal, and it isn't near as strong.\n\n It isn't even a fifth as strong as lemon.\n\n But some people don't like the taste of grapefruit.\n\n**[Attendee#2]**\n\nThe orange and lemon is beautiful.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nJapanese use oranges a lot for that.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Meat Sauces. Lemon Demineralization \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nHave you tried the sauces\n\n There are so many sauces in the recipe book?\n\n Just a taste of it makes it easy to eat fish, even if it isn't marinated.\n\n\nMarinating a little bit in lemon is fine.\n\n I wouldn't do it in lime all the time.\n\n Lime is antibacterial, lemon juice is fermentation.\n\n Helps ferment and break down the fish.\n\n And if you're going to do that, you just might rinse it off if you want get the excess lemon off.\n\n\nIs it bothering your teeth or you notice a difference.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, you're just so thin.\n\n You have no extra fat.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nWhy would it bother his teeth.\n\n Why would it affect the lemon?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, the lemon has a tendency to attach itself to minerals, a lot of minerals, and also it searches for fat?\n\n\nThe more fat it pulls, the more minerals go with the fat.\n\n The reverse of that is if you have too much cream, you can demineralize the system because the cream will start pulling minerals out of the body.\n\n Butter doesn't do that for some reason.\n\n Cream will, excessive cream.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nBut the lemon and butter in the lube formula is fine though, in terms of pulling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, that's fine?\n\n Won't do it.\n\n You can put too much lemon in, absolutely.\n\n And you'll have the same thing happen, but you know, I have that limit in there, but what I put in the book is the absolute maximum, you can always reduce it.\n\n You have a lemon problem.\n\n \nSo, my suggestion for you would be put on more weight, and try to use less lemon, try to use some of the other sauces.\n\n\nBecause there is a lot of good sauces in there that you could to eat the fish raw without marinating it in lemon.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Melatonin, Supplements, Are All Toxic \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nMelatonin, all of them are chemicals\n\n There is no such thing as a natural supplement.\n\n It has to be heat or solvent extracted always, no other way about it.\n\n If you want a substance like that, you've taken it into a rock form.\n\n Feed it to your plant, take those supplements and feed it to a plant that you're going to eat from.\n\n\nYou're gonna juice the plant juice, juice the leaves, then you're gonna get a phenomenal amount that you'll be able to utilize, and won't cause a collection of toxicity in your body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nEven like standard process.\n\n\nAajonus]\nEven standard process, it's all bullshit?\n\n They say, \"Well, we told the laboratory\", but the laboratory's gonna make the products and it's gonna do things that it may not tell you exactly how it is, does it.\n\n And they say, \"Oh, well, it's our patented way of doing it\".\n\n But let me tell you, I've been in all those laboratories and every one of them uses chemical.\n\n And usually benzene a derivative of benzene is universally used in all laboratories to extract nutrients.\n\n\nAnd you have to understand if they want those finite nutrients and there are very little of them in a food.\n\n Where are they gonna get it all.\n\n They're gonna process all this food and have all this waste product, not going to happen?\n\n Just like vitamin E, 99.\n\n9% of vitamin E comes from Fuji and Kodak.\n\n It's not even a vitamin E truly.\n\n\nThey paid their scientists millions of dollars to come up with a way to take care of their development fluid waste.\n\n One scientist who was very, very bright realized it was 70% of the structure of vitamin E, D alpha-tocopherol, 70% like it.\n\n Not like it, but 70%, like it in molecular structure.\n\n So, he convinced everybody to sell it as vitamin E.\n\n So, when you get a natural vitamin E supplement, let's say you've got a hundred units of vitamin E and that's in that capsule.\n\n\n5% of it's going to be from soy or corn.\n\n The other 95% is going to be from Kodak and Fuji, which is a toxic solvent.\n\n It.\n\n Saves them hundreds of million dollars a year in storing that chemical.\n\n So, they just combine it with oil and call it vitamin D.\n\n\nSo, no supplements are safe and good.\n\n They will poison you and give you highs.\n\n They will contaminate you and cause adrenaline rush and make you feel like you're good, but so does cocaine.\n\n That doesn't mean it's healthy.\n\n You'll get rid of symptoms, but that doesn't mean you're getting better.\n\n That doesn't mean you're getting well.\n\n That doesn't mean you're getting rid of your disease.\n\n \nSometimes it will stop the disease because the body has to use all of its nutrients just to handle the poison.\n\n If you want a short life, hell, it's the way to go for some people, and that's okay.\n\n I have no judgment about it, but if you wanna have a chance on longevity without disease, it's not the way to go.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) Milk Diet \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of a milk diet, as opposed to\n\n.\n\n.\n\n let's say an all milk diet where you have chronic disease: asthma, diabetes.\n\n As opposed to something where you have milk and meat, would a milk diet be fine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, in some cases it will be, but it depends upon the individual and the type of problems in the body?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nYou're talking about raw milk though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\n Yeah?\n\n Raw milk.\n\n She's talking about an all raw milk diet.\n\n She's asking, can a raw milk diet cure diseases.\n\n Yes, it can cure some, definitely.\n\n\nIt's cured emphysema, tuberculosis, diabetes of all sorts.\n\n So yes, it's possible.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nAnd that's just raw milk.\n\n That's no vegetables.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, that's nothing else, but just a raw milk diet?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat if you used raw milk instead of as your meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDoesn't work?\n\n\nIf you're very skinny, you've been a vegetarian, a raw milk diet isn't gonna work for you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI don't mean an all raw milk diet, just a, a diet where instead of eating, let's say eggs or meat and stuff, you substitute, so all that type of stuff, like eggs and meat and all your animal products are milk or butter fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI just said, no, it doesn't work.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAny reason.\n\n What's the reason?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI don't know the reason?\n\n Just doesn't.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Milk Makes You Sleep \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nOf course milk, you know, and I'm drinking the kefir before I go to sleep\n\n It's also with honey and eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nMilk.\n\n If you've had a lot of adrenaline overreaction in your lifetime and you start drinking milk, you're gonna react like a baby cause that whole nervous system needs to relax.\n\n Eat, and sleep, eat, and sleep.\n\n\nHoney does the same thing.\n\n It is so healing so rapidly that the body just wants to use all of its energy to relax the nervous system.\n\n So, that's why you go into sleepiness.\n\n It's not a diabetic reaction.\n\n Diabetic reaction is spacing out, getting dizzy, blacking out.\n\n Getting very dizzy, you stand up and everything goes black and you're trying to hold onto nothing, so you don't pass out and break your head or nose or teeth.\n\n That's a diabetic reaction.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Miracle Mineral Supplemnt \n \n**[2007],[Barbara]**\n\n\n\nThis is a stupid question in some ways, and yet it's going to be asked a lot\n\n So, I wanted to ask it.\n\n It's coming out on the internet now and it's been used in Africa.\n\n There's a product called MMS.\n\n Have you heard of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nMhm?\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\nMiracle mineral supplement and from reading about it, it is, they saying it's actually di-chloro chlorine oxide.\n\n It's got two chlorine molecules for the oxygen and they've been curing hepatitis, aids, malaria and cancers, and many other things with it.\n\n And really they've stopped them using it in Africa because the drug companies have said they will not give any more money in aid to Africa if they allow it to come into the country.\n\n Now it's been coming into this country and it's coming from Canada and other places.\n\n It seems a miracle.\n\n But to me, having known what chlorine is like, but they do say that when the chlorine is released with the vinegar or the lemon juice or citrus acid, it actually had the waste product become sodium and chlorine.\n\n So, just mixes with it.\n\n So.\n\n I'm not sure.\n\n I'm wondering if you knew about it and whether you could help us because if this is such a miracle in those third world countries, does it mean that it's right for us or is it gonna kill all the organisms in our bodies as well as the bad ones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOkay?\n\n Go back to what I said in the rest of ebook, 72% of all diseases will reverse on their own, all conditions.\n\n All these people take claims that their product cause these reversals when it's a natural process of the body healing itself.\n\n \nSomebody gets a disease, they take that product, their body's in the process of healing itself anyway.\n\n That product has nothing to do with them healing.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\nEven with malaria that takes us two days, which would normally take weeks and weeks and months with hepatitis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWe don't see enough of those?\n\n I've read the literature and not enough cases proves that to me.\n\n A lot of people will heal in a few days with malaria people who live in the jungle heal very rapidly.\n\n\nA whitey, one of us, white bred people go down there.\n\n Not me.\n\n I won't get it.\n\n I don't even get malaria even if I drink water that's been hacked into by somebody with malaria cuz I've done it.\n\n But the average person who's on the sad, the standard American diet goes down there and gets malaria.\n\n Their malaria is going to do a lot of cleansing for a very long time.\n\n\nSo, they may keep malaria a couple of months, but your native isn't going to keep it long at all.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\nWhy have they died of it then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThey don't die of it?\n\n They die of the treatment.\n\n They die of the penicillin or the amoxicillin, or the Cipro that they're getting to handle it.\n\n Whatever they're getting that is poisoning them.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Modly Cheese \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nMoldy cheese\n\n I scrape the outer white layer off cause that has all the spores in it and you can get too much mycelium generating in your system and you can get very lethargic.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Mold Detox Drink \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nYou need to have about, depending upon the size of your body, anywhere from 4 -5 tablespoons of lime juice\n\n Like if you're a very large person, like John back there.\n\n He could have 8 tablespoons of lime juice and there would be like 1.\n\n5 - 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, then you'd have an equal amount of the lime and lemon combination.\n\n\nYou'd have an equal amount of honey to that combination of lemon/lime.\n\n So, if you have six tablespoons of lemon/lime altogether, you'd have six tablespoons of honey.\n\n\nThen you have 5 - 6 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 - 2 tablespoons of dairy cream.\n\n You blend that all together.\n\n Some people, if they have a lot of allergies, they need to use a half to a whole teaspoon of vinegar, and then you blend that all together and you add it to 2 - 4 ounces of sparkling water.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS: (depending on size)\n4-5 TBSP of Lime Juice\n1.\n\n5 - 3 TBSP of Lemon Juice\n5.\n\n5 - 8 TBSP of Honey\n5 - 6 TBSP of Coconut Cream\n1 - 2 TBSP of Dairy Cream\n\nIt's gonna taste like a lime coconut float.\n\n Do not gulp it, even though it's delicious.\n\n You've got to sip it cuz if you piss it out, it's not going to get in there and destroy the molds.\n\n Now you only do that.\n\n If you have a mold situation and you're very toxic, you can do it for three to four days in a row.\n\n\nThen after that only one day a week, because just like an antibiotic that lime juice will  will destroy the good bacteria, as well as the bad, once it gets up to a certain level.\n\n \nWell, it's good as an antibiotic.\n\n Let's say you have a case of spinal meningitis or cerebral meningitis, and it's too much.\n\n You're gonna panic and end up going to the hospital, rather than go to the hospital, have that.\n\n And that'll slow that detoxification down.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\nYou said mold on cement's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nMold on cement is okay?\n\n\nI mean, once the lime has broken it down it still doesn't absorb and digest very easily into our systems on this diet.\n\n I mean, for a person who isn't not on the diet, they may have a problem with the mold in concrete.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Mold Toxicity \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nType of molds that are dangerous\n\n What can harm you.\n\n And then do you have any recipe for in case I was exposed to mold and  to stop it from?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAny mold that grows on a building that is not wood, is not concrete, is a toxic mold cuz it's feeding on the building materials, the fabricated building materials, it's always a toxic substance?\n\n\nIt will always be a toxic mold, a toxic fungus, and when it spores, you breathe those in.\n\n What you have to do to the environment, to your walls, wherever it's contaminated.\n\n You need to dry out the room, wear a mask, vacuum the walls and the ceiling and the floors.\n\n Then you have to wash it down with vinegar and some non-aluminum baking soda and a little bit of the Biokleen degreaser, cleaner degreaser.\n\n\nAnd what that has in it, they use grapefruit seed oil and lemon peel oil in that particular soap detergent, and it's the only one that I know is 98% biodegradable, all the others say biodegradable, including seventh, whatever they call themselves seventh generation, and like 12% is biodegradable.\n\n Everything else is toxic.\n\n \nSo, when they say you have something as biodegradable, it's usually a false statement.\n\n Very little bit of that is biodegradable.\n\n Anyway, wash the walls down thoroughly and you wear a mask this whole time, and then you have to dry out the walls.\n\n You need some space heaters, coil based space heaters, those things get coil and orange hot.\n\n\nTwo or three of them per room.\n\n If you're doing a room at a time and then you need to seal off one of the rooms with some kind of a canvas in between to keep the heat in there, cuz it needs to get up to about 130° and that'll bake it through into the wall.\n\n You need to do that for about two days, bake it.\n\n\nSo, you destroy the mold deep into the wall, and then you need to vacuum it again, cuz it will spore as it's first getting warm.\n\n The mycelium, which is the basic mother of the fungus is setting out little spores, and they create those little fuzzy things.\n\n Those  are your mushrooms, those are your spores.\n\n \nSo, you need to vacuum that then you're okay until you have another rain spell or moisture spell.\n\n If you don't keep your house very dry.\n\n If you're living in at a beach where it's always moist, you're in trouble.\n\n You may have to do that every month, every two months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIf your house is made of wood.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf your house is made of wood, no problem?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat about the paint from the mold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThe paint?\n\n That's a problem.\n\n That mold is not a problem with an animal's body, including ours.\n\n But if the paint's getting moldy, you've got trouble, plaster board, any of it that.\n\n\nCause what it does is mycelium digests the paint, makes it into flakes.\n\n The mycelium that's grown on paint is very toxic substance, when it spores and that becomes powder in the air and we inhale it, it poisons your lungs.\n\n It poisons your whole body.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (66) Nerve Damage, How Much

Molds \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nI need to eat cucumbers and the coconut cream, but how much of the coconut cream per day\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, coconut cream is very detoxifying?\n\n So, I usually say no more than five ounces a day for somebody your size.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDoes that regenerate the nerves.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat doesn't regenerate?\n\n\nSee, anytime you have shingles, it's from penicillin or antibiotics.\n\n The molds grow perpetually in some people, in a lot of people.\n\n It stores in the joints a lot.\n\n Penicillin will usually come out as a black mold.\n\n Can cause a black mold on the hands, you see it in people's nails or on their feet.\n\n\nYou see black areas in their feet.\n\n It's all penicillin discharge and mold.\n\n That's the excrement from the penicillin.\n\n Tetracycline is a little different.\n\n It sounds like you have Tetracycline  or Cipro or something like that because your nerve damaged.\n\n \nSee in some people you can't stop it.\n\n It grows and grows and multiplies like crazy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCoconut cream and cucumbers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat doesn't regenerate the tissue, that helps clean that tissue out of there, but to destroy the molds?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, what about the pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThe pain, you have to use the pain formula in the recipe book, honey and butter, eating a little bit of that all day long?\n\n\nSoak it in hot water with coconut cream and milk in it.\n\n Hot water bottles.\n\n Put your hand on a hot water bottle at night.\n\n All of that heat is to make sure that you increase circulation into that area.\n\n \nAnytime you have a bruise or a sprain or a break, never put cold ice on it.\n\n When you do that, you constrict the circulation into that area.\n\n You're restricting the nutrient flow.\n\n So what's gonna happen.\n\n You're gonna keep the bruised tissue in the area and you're gonna scar?\n\n What happens to those athletes that keep putting ice on it.\n\n What happens?\n\n They have surgeries, multiple surgeries because they never heal properly?\n\n They keep re-injuring and re-injuring.\n\n \nRemember Oscar that I talked about at We Want To Live.\n\n The skier, put him on a good diet?\n\n He won two medals a year and a half after his injury where they say he'd never even be able to dance again.\n\n And you know, in Switzerland he won metals, so the body can heal itself if you don't freeze it up, if you don't constrict and you allow the proper nutrients.\n\n\nPutting ice on an area any more than two minutes is a bad thing.\n\n Put lots of heat on it, and then if you just want to numb the pain a little, put some ice on it for a little while.\n\n Like I say, when I had my problem and the pain, my leg would just get burning hot and painful, so the Thai ladies would take the refrigerated coconut oil and coconut cream, which is hard as butter when it's cold.\n\n So, they take a big glob of it, just rub it over my knee and down the shin and up and down for about five minutes, but not one place did it stay on, did the ice sit there.\n\n And it was never that cold as ice.\n\n It was down to about 50°, maybe 48° degrees, 45° degrees is all it was.\n\n And that was enough to numb the pain, but not enough to cause a restriction of circulation of nutrients into the area, that you do not want to do.\n\n Because you will scar and you will not heal properly.\n\n \nSo, lots of heat in hot water will help you perspire the toxins that remain that cause the nerve damage from the fungus waste.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nLot of heat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLot of heat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nButter and honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes?\n\n\nHow to get rid of the mold, I wrote an article, it's in the newsletter this week.\n\n\nSo, just pick it up on the newsletter.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Ocd, Raw Milk, Raw Cream. Soda Cravings \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nShe asked me what do you commend for any kind of obsessive compulsive for conditions\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou're talking about excessive compulsive in physical activity or mental.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBoth?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLots of milk and lots of raw cream.\n\n Settle the body down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nHe drinks a lot of soda and she's just trying to find a way for him to stop.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLots of milk.\n\n You can make something like a mixture of take about.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n1/2 cup of fruit\n3 tablespoons of coconut cream\n5 tablespoons of raw cream\n1.\n\n5 tablespoons of raw honey\n\nBlend that all together, and put it with about three ounces of Gerolsteiner.\n\n It'll make like a float, a fruit float, and that's very satisfying.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAny idea how to stop the craving for soda.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's what I'm talking about?\n\n That will help stop the craving for the soda.\n\n He'll start craving that instead of the sodas.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (68) Old Milk Always Better \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nWhat are your observations on the difference between fresh milk and old milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nJust remember that old milk is always better because just like in the high meat and all of that, it's breaking down?\n\n Doesn't taste as nice and as fresh and as delicious, unless you put honey in it as soon as you get it home.\n\n\nMy milk, most of the time, I put my honey in as soon as I get home.\n\n Because I drink a half gallon or a little bit more than half gallon a day in the summertime when it's hot cuz I don't drink water and I'll take about 16 ounce glass canning jar.\n\n I'll put about 12 ounces or 10 ounces of milk in it and about six ounces of honey in that.\n\n And then I blend that, and then pour a little bit into all of my half gallons.\n\n I'll have about six to eight half gallons of milk.\n\n So, I put a little bit in each one, of course, I pour out a little of every one and then pour that into it.\n\n And then it stays sweet even if it goes off and the bacteria is growing in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nDo you put it in the refrigerator.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes, I do put it in the refrigerator?\n\n However, a day or two before I'm going to drink it.\n\n I put it in a dark cupboard out of the refrigerator because I like to have kefir.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n You put it in the refrigerator right after you put the honey in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nLet me start it over again?\n\n I take the milk home, I take a little out of each container, I put it in a jar, I blend about two tablespoons of honey per quart of milk.\n\n Two tablespoons of honey per quart.\n\n So, that's four tablespoons of honey per half gallon.\n\n So, I pour that much into each half gallon.\n\n I put it in the refrigerator.\n\n I put some in the cupboard immediately and I have some left from the day before, because I like my milk 24 hours or more old before I drink it.\n\n In fact, I like it thick like kefir and sometimes that takes up to two days.\n\n So, that's the way I will have it.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (69) Olive Oil Swishing \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nToday I had read about an olive oil cleanse for the teeth, and I wonder if you know about that\n\n You take a tablespoon of olive oil and you swish it around for three minutes and spit it out.\n\n Do you know anything about that.\n\n Or how do you feel about it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt works?\n\n I mean, any kind of fat, it isn't just olive oil.\n\n\nIt's any fat, you swish it around in your mouth, the gums.\n\n Remember the gums are the major detoxifiers for the brain, the gum, the tongue and the salivary glands.\n\n So, you've got that oil in there, it's all in the mechanism already.\n\n When you have that fat swishing around, it's going to dump.\n\n It's like when a baby suckles the teet or a nipple on a bottle, heavy toxins come from the brain into the mouth and go down there with the milk to detoxify it, but that's a tremendous mineral loss for the baby, but yet it's protecting the baby's brain.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) Overweight \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nSo, I had the consultation yesterday\n\n You said my weight was perfect, but actually I'm probably 60 pounds heavier than I wanna be, and like I played basketball this morning.\n\n Like a bull in a China shop.\n\n I mean, I feel best probably about 190 pounds, and I'm 270 right now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAnd how tall are you.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\nI'm 6' 2''\n\n\n5' 7'' & 3/4, and I'm 182 pounds and he wants to be 190?\n\n Does that make sense.\n\n No?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhen I was 18, that's when I was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat was when you were 18.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWell, anyway.\n\n I wanna dump a lot of weight.\n\n I mean, you know, exercise and stuff like that.\n\n\nI wanna get back into playing shape.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, would you rather be happy or fit looking.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWell, I was happy when I was down to 200, a couple years ago?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThat's when you were a kid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nNo, no.\n\n Two years ago I was down to 200.\n\n I stopped playing for about a year cause I had business and stuff.\n\n Yeah, I'm gonna be happy regardless, I'm not worried about that part.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOh yeah.\n\n I saw your eyes, I don't think so?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI can't be unhappy.\n\n\nIs that going to harm me as long as I'm taking lots of raw fat and stuff, I just exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you ate every hour, no?\n\n If you can eat every hour, if you can eat some fat every hour, you can stay at a lower weight.\n\n As long as you don't get injured.\n\n Yeah.\n\n If you get injured, then you're in trouble.\n\n Like when I got injured here, I was up to 192 pounds.\n\n I'm 23% body fat.\n\n Do I look it.\n\n No?\n\n Because fat molecules when they're not cooked are very small, very fine and very concentrated.\n\n When you cook a fat, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size.\n\n So, I've had nothing but raw fats since 1972.\n\n So, the fats in my body are all small, so I can be fat, but not look it.\n\n They say that an athlete, male athlete should be 7% to 10% body fat.\n\n I'm 23% body fat, three times what I'm supposed to if you look at 7%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI think I'm about 45% right now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou're probably 32%, 33%.\n\n\nAnyway, you can take off some weight, but if you get uncomfortable and start having problems, put it back on, regain it.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (71) Ozone \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nRidiculous\n\n Ozone is very bad.\n\n Ozone will oxidize the fat in your skin, then your skin will start dissolving.\n\n So, not good for the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAll these places advertise ozone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThey were sold a false bill of.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n if you ozonate anything- one way you can really tell how bad it is is find somebody that will give you ozonated olive oil.\n\n It is the foulest smelling shit in the world, and shit is a good thing.\n\n But this oxidized olive oil is foul smelling, and it's very repulsive.\n\n It putrifies it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThere are people that are injecting ozone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI know I've watched 12 of them die.\n\n It's just people get hoodwinked into doing these things and you have to look who's behind it.\n\n Who comes up with these ideas.\n\n Ridiculous?\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (72) Prediabetes \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nI've done the diet a little over a year, and I go to the doctor for the regular tests and one of the blood tests, I've never had this problem before\n\n I just had it redone after I saw you the last time.\n\n So, I'm showing pre-diabetes with very high sugar, and I do notice that sometimes when I eat certain things, like I feel my heart rate going really fast.\n\n\nAnd of course, I'm just eating the meat, the dairy and the honey and all that.\n\n And I started cutting down on the honey, but I wondered if there's any other.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOkay.\n\n Is that all the symptom you're having.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThe palpitations and I don't know?\n\n I didn't feel right before I did it, and I was wondering, because I didn't have sugar for like 20, 30 years before I went on your diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut that's not a diabetic reaction.\n\n The diabetic reaction is spacing out.\n\n Getting very weak, getting dizzy, blacking out.\n\n I had diabetes.\n\n I know what diabetic symptoms are.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo what's that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nHeart palpitations, that can come from minerals, having metals getting into the blood at one time, the heart does not want to let it settle, so it pumps the blood fast through there hoping some minerals in the digestive tract will attract them out of it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, what's the prediabetes test that he's saying I have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThe prediabetes will make almost 80% of the people who get their tests done look diabetic or prediabetic?\n\n It's meant to do that, to get you thinking, \"Oh, I'm going diabetic.\n\n Maybe I should end up taking diabetic medicine, insulin\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut I wanted to know, is there's anything I should or shouldn't do with the diet, you're saying, nevermind.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIf you're having heart palpitations like that, you drink cream?\n\n I have it if I have a juice in the morning, if I have more than eight ounces, My heart will go like this.\n\n I'll get a little sugar reaction, but it's not a diabetic reaction.\n\n It doesn't mean I'm not utilizing my sugars.\n\n I'm utilizing too many sugars, which is the opposite diabetes.\n\n Plus all the minerals that are pulled out, so I'll put it either an egg in my juice or a little cream in it the next day, but it only happens to me first thing in the morning.\n\n One out of 15 days, but if I can tell it's going to happen, I'll put my egg in it and cream in it, and then I don't need to worry about it the next day.\n\n \nDiabetes is reversed by having a proper fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI'm not saying that she should eat no fat, but I'm saying her body weight in general.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWouldn't have anything to do with diabetes or sugar.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (73) Probiotics \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nThe probiotics\n\n So, the probiotics add all of those kind of infinite bacterias back to the body.\n\n Some people eat worms, some people eat fecal matter, some people eat high meat.\n\n Meat that's allowed to grow with lots of bacteria.\n\n There are many ways to get those probiotics.\n\n\nProbiotics means living, decaying matter, pre-broken down pre-digested.\n\n Now people ask me, why does the high meat work so quickly, 10, 20 minutes and you can go from depression to happiness like that.\n\n Because when the bacteria feeds on those meats, it pre-digests them, it doesn't won't work on your own system.\n\n It won't work on your own tissue.\n\n It only works on the tissue of that meat.\n\n When it goes through your digestive tract, you're supposed to have all those minute bacteria to do that already in your intestines.\n\n We're pretty well robbed of it.\n\n We poisoned our system.\n\n Then when you get down to the bowel, you have all that E coli.\n\n \nE coli is responsible for the final digestion of fat and proteins.\n\n Reduces it to those finite molecules that feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n If your E coli is poor, you're not gonna feed your brain and your nervous system.\n\n When you make high meat, the bacteria that naturally grows in it and starts free to pre-digesting it, breaks it down to those finite molecules already, so your body doesn't have to wait 16, 18 hours until he gets into the bowel.\n\n\nIt works immediately.\n\n You've absorbed those proteins and those fats and those finite molecules to feed your brain and nervous.\n\n That's why it works so miraculously.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThere are some companies that sell probiotics that maybe I'll just email you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, there's The Primal Defense.\n\n Their pill form is ridiculous.\n\n Once you solidify it into pill form, all those things are dead.\n\n The powder form it's dry.\n\n You need to put it in juice, you need to let it start becoming alive by hydrating it with something.\n\n It could be a little bit of fermented vegetable juice, that will help bring it back to life, but you don't wanna have the pill form and you don't wanna take the capsules that it comes in.\n\n Take it out of the capsules if you're going to have that.\n\n That's mainly worm casing.\n\n \nThere are others.\n\n There's the EMS and that's in a liquid form.\n\n I don't trust those because they're not from food.\n\n They're mainly with fish and amphibians.\n\n So, I'm not sure that they're proper for the human digestive tract.\n\n I have not experimented with it, I'm not in a situation where I have a laboratory again to work in.\n\n So, I won't be doing any on that until I set up the laboratory in the clinic in Thailand.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nWhen will that be.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAbout three, four years before it's completed?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nYou bought the property already.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nDon't wanna talk about that yet?\n\n Those are the only two that I know about.\n\n Those two products: EMS, and The Primal Defense.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (74) Pupils Wont Dshrink With Light \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nLike, what exactly they are, how it would affect you in your everyday behaviors, if you have some shut off\n\n Can you explain like what the drive is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhen I do the irises, pupils that don't shrink when I shine the light in their eye, that's a sign that they have certain lanes of their brain closed?\n\n\nThat doesn't mean that a whole area or cognitive center or motor center is shut down.\n\n That just means there's a limited passage of information going in and out.\n\n So, when I look at each pupil, I say that there's six lanes into that particular half of their brain.\n\n Six lanes into the other half.\n\n So, there's 12 lanes together, and depending upon how much that pupil will shrink, that tells me how much of the brain is open and available.\n\n If you shine a light in the eye and that pupil doesn't shrink.\n\n That means that brain is not open very much because it's not getting the light.\n\n\nIf it gets the light, if it's all getting the light that pupil's going to shrink and limit the amount of light that gets into that brain, but it doesn't make anything cognitively worse for most people.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (75) Red Eye, Egg White \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nLike I said in the book, egg white\n\n You just put egg white in your eye and your eyes will be white quickly.\n\n Also, if you have blurring vision, your eyes are not in good shape and you have to wear glasses, putting egg white in the eye twice a day has improved in 60% of the clients, has improved the vision by 30% in a year.\n\n\nAnd the way I do it when I do it is I'll have an egg and a little egg white in a glass, and I dip my finger in it, so I got a little bubble of it.\n\n Pull the lid down, rub it along the sclera on the bottom of the white of the eye on the bottom, then I'll hold the eye open like this and then I'll roll the eye around like a circus master to get all the egg white all around.\n\n \nTakes about three minutes, so your eyes aren't blurred, your vision isn't blurred and the eyes are just relaxed and cool.\n\n And then the redness just goes away.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\nYou chase it with  purified water or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, no, no.\n\n You wanna leave that in there.\n\n Egg white is 90% exactly like the tears that you make, higher in protein, and that's really good cuz then it strengthens the cornea.\n\n And when the cornea gets weak is when it starts warping and you lose your vision.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\nI've been putting lime juice in it for ages and I felt like I should wash it out after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, that's an antibacterial.\n\n Yeah, but put egg white in to wash it out.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\nI put it in egg white, and then I put it in with a dropper.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThen you put egg white in pure by itself after that to wash it out.\n\n.\n\n You can use an eye dropper, but then you have to clean the fricking eye dropper.\n\n It's a mess.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (76) Reminzeralize Cavity \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nIs there anything you could do to remineralize a decalcified area that's going too far into\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's very difficult to remineralize a cavity, unless you're very young?\n\n I've never seen anybody over 27 years old do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nSo, you have to have it filled.\n\n\nBut I mean is that happening because of all the toxins?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nAll the toxins?\n\n Yep.\n\n And you've got to brush every.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, yeah!\n\n\nWith coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nCoconut cream and the clay.\n\n Putting the clay on at night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI wouldn't put clay on at night.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\nYou said you roll-\n\n\nI said just if you have an infection.\n\n If you've got an abscess and you've got pus coming out, you put that in there.\n\n Not as a regular thing on the teeth, cuz that'll demineralize the teeth more.\n\n The clay will if you leave it on the tooth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhy would it be demineralize.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBecause it's drying, it keeps drawing out?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nBut you're wet your mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou're wet in your mouth, but do you know how much absorbent clay is.\n\n It's continuously absorbent?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI gotta be putting out mercury and heavy metals in that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah, but if you leave it in there thickly on your gums, it's going to demineralize your dentine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWe've talked about that before, and I thought that was something you were quite heavy about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI'm happy with you brushing your teeth with the clay, as long as you have some kind of a fat with it.\n\n\nEspecially the coconut cream, especially fermented coconut cream, but I'm not happy about leaving clay on the teeth very often.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut you just see people that didn't like to do it cause they looked messy.\n\n That was one, I remember discussing it.\n\n We discussed it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nBut it wasn't about leaving a lot of clay on the teeth.\n\n\nCause it will demineralize the tooth.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (77) Safest Tooth Filling \n \n \n \n \n### (78) Salt Kinds For Pool \n \n \n \n \n### (79) Salt Pool, Dont Use Too Much, Can Use Sand \n \n \n \n \n### (80) Setting Bones \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nI dislocated my third toe, like all the way down, it's not all the way off the bone, but it's like partially off\n\n And they were saying that I had to get x-rays done cause they didn't know if they needed to do surgery or not.\n\n And they were saying, if I didn't get it set properly or whatever, I could develop arthritis or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, your cartilage is gonna grind itself.\n\n Well, I broke six toes one time on a bicycle accident.\n\n I was riding in the desert and I was going pretty fast and somebody had left their sprinkler system on all night.\n\n So, it created an algae in the gutter, and it was just like ice.\n\n My bike flipped out, my foot caught on the curb and ripped the toes apart.\n\n So, they were ripped to here, broken here, here, here, and two of them here.\n\n So, of course, I don't like to go to doctors.\n\n \nSo, I knew a 14 year old girl that loved to crack people's knuckles.\n\n So, I went to visit her and she cracked my knuckles in place.\n\n So, she just pulled, and then it's set right back where it's supposed to go.\n\n All you need is somebody, chiropractor or somebody like that.\n\n \nYour tendons will realign it, it just needs to snap out first.\n\n I couldn't it.\n\n I tense up when I'm going to do it, so I couldn't do it myself.\n\n So, I had that little girl do it and she loved doing it.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (81) Shea Butter Is Processed \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nShea butter is processed butter\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThey say it's natural.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's all processed, completely processed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nHow do they process it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, they usually pasteurize it and then they steam it in some circumstances and then they spin it to get the fluid out of it, so it will cake?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThey tell us it's just stirred in the hot sun in Africa.\n\n It's collected in Africa and stirred in the hot sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah.\n\n Well, if you believe that, that's a good one, cuz it isn't, it.\n\n That's the way they used to make it.\n\n That's the old way of making it.\n\n But the butter, when you get shea butter like that, it is very foul smelling and tasting.\n\n It tastes like eating really ripe, strong Buffalo meat, and no I've never smelled any shea butter like that in this country, it's all highly processed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nThe natural one smells like you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nThe natural one smells foul.\n\n It almost smells like ozonated olive oil, but not putrid.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (82) Should You Eercise \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nMy question has to do with the exercise\n\n Will exercise on your diet keep somebody in shape.\n\n Because you said that you don't exercise, so I I'm not exercising as much as I usually do?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell.\n\n I'm not saying that you're not supposed to exercise.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nIs that better for my type to exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYes?\n\n If you want to help your weight and get firmer, exercise.\n\n But I look at activity rings in the eyes, that tells me how much hormones you were made to produce every day for how much physical activity.\n\n For each activity ring, it's an hour.\n\n That doesn't mean hour of exercise means an hour of activity.\n\n\nSo, I don't remember what you had.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\n6.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou had 6.\n\n So, you're supposed to be busy six hours a day.\n\n So, you could be exercising two hours a day if you want plus your regular activity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBut does that mean physical exercise or you saying something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nPhysical, yeah?\n\n\nAnd singing is the most strenuous of all.\n\n 20 minutes of singing is like an hour on a treadmill.\n\n If you're really anxious and in anxiety because you haven't burned your activity hormones for the day.\n\n You're going to be in anxiety and you will have to burn 'em up in anxiety.\n\n\nSo, just start singing or start exercising, do something to burn them.\n\n That's a misnomer, burning to utilize the energy, to utilize those hormones.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (83) Skinny, Tired, Trouble Digesting \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nI've been tired for over 20\n\n5 years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nSo, you're a tired person.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYes, I am.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYou're too skinny.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI don't think I digest very well.\n\n There's a time when I ate so much that the night had come up in my mouth.\n\n  I was so thin, I couldn't eat anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nRight.\n\n Well, then go on, let's say three days a month or five days, three to five days a month do nothing but eggs all day long and milk before you go to bed and milk at night.\n\n Give your intestines an entire break from meats, from digesting, and it'll also heal them from the outside in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nEggs and milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nEggs all day long, milk before you go to bed, and milk at night?\n\n \nThe milk has the cream in it to relax the nervous system because when you're detoxing heavily like that, and your time's not spent on digestion, your whole body has all this extra activity and it can cause the nervous system to get a little wired.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (84) Soft Cheese \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nAmos's cheese has been very soft for the last few months, when I first got it from him a year or two ago, it used to be quite hard or not hard, but much firmer\n\n What do you think about the very soft cheese that you can always bend it.\n\n Is it any better or how's it working in our body when it's very soft.\n\n\nI mean, it's just like butter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nYeah.\n\n Well, it depends on what cheese you're getting.\n\n What kind of cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nBaby swiss?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI don't know why you're getting it that way cuz I get the same cheese here and it's not that soft.\n\n I mean it's soft, but it's not that soft.\n\n\nIt's not creamy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\nIt's a different farmers cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nYeah.\n\n It's not his.\n\n We buy the five pound block and it comes in plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWhere are you getting it from.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAmos, but it not?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, Amos doesn't make any.\n\n He has several people making cheese for him.\n\n Eli king is one of them, is his main cheese maker.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAnd so who do you like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI buy the same cheese?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nWhat's the name.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nIt's Eli's?\n\n Eli's products, they send them, but some of the cheeses that he has, I haven't gotten any of the baby swiss that's like mush, but some of the others, it just means that it hasn't been aged 60 days.\n\n Some of the mold is still breaking it down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI keep mine for two months and it's just the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, you have to leave it out of the refrigerator to do that, or you have to leave it out of the package in the refrigerator.\n\n So, it'll dry, if you keep it in the plastic, it's not going to make it mature.\n\n \n.\n \n \n \n### (85) Soft Vs Hard Cheese \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nActually, the softers are better for you, or they're not\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nDepends on what you need?\n\n If you need the molds to help break down toxicity in your body, then the softer cheeses are better.\n\n If you need a magnet and a sponge to bind with toxicity and then remove it from your body, a harder cheese is better.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nSo, which is a harder cheese.\n\n The farmers cheese?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nFarmer's cheese is soft?\n\n The dry cheeses, the brick cheese.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \n\nCheddar is hard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\n Cheddar, yeah.\n\n Jack.\n\n Any of those.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (86) Some People Never Heal \n \nYeah, that's a problem with some people, they just do not heal cuz they don't eat good diet\n\n \n\nYou know, it took me three months of eating properly to catch up on all the loss.\n\n Three months, then my vision started going back into its proper form again, so I wore glasses for a month and a half to read.\n\n  \n\nHe may have extra scar issue that could take years and years to get rid of, but at least his leg could correct itself to where he could function better.\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (87) Soy Milk Is Poison \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nSoy milk is poison\n\n Soy milk is highly chemically processed with benzene byproducts.\n\n So, it's all chemical.\n\n Soy has a lot of IgG, which is a steroid in the brain, high in the brain, and it causes brain tumors in laboratory animals.\n\n And I mean, 36% of laboratory animals got brain tumors living on soy processed for human consumption.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nHow you get that soy outta your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nNot easy?\n\n You just have to just stay on a good diet for a long time and make sure you're eating enough cheese, have enough minerals to bind with it.\n\n Eating enough, coconut cream every day.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (88) Steam Baths \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nSteam bath will damage your lungs, your mucus membranes, and it will cause your mucus to get thinner and thinner every time it burns your your lungs and your sinuses\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nBecause it's chlorine or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nJust the temperature, the steam?\n\n The steam has to go to 212 degrees or higher.\n\n That steam by the time you're inhaling, it's 160 degrees.\n\n \n\nSauna's the same way.\n\n It's too hot.\n\n It'll damage the vitamins and enzymes in your lungs and sinuses.\n\n It's too hot, 102 to 105 is ideal, immersed in water.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \n\nHow do you keep the water hot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, what I do to keep the water hot, I have a hot tub now back there, so I don't have to worry about that, so it’s a consistent temperature?\n\n But when I used to use a bathtub, I would fill the bathtub with scaling hot water halfway, let it sit for about 7 to 10 minutes and it would HEAT the entire tub.\n\n Then I would put lukewarm water in to fill the rest of the tub, and then my water would be warm and my whole tub would be warm, and the water wouldn't cool quickly.\n\n Then I put my milk, my vinegar, my sea salt, and some coconut cream in that water to get rid of any toxins if you're using municipal water.\n\n \n\nIf you're using well water like I have, just a little milk or coconut cream, and it's all you need just to keep your skin from getting dry.\n\n In the book, We Want To live under lymphatic baths, it tells you how much of those ingredients to put in the bathtub to neutralize poisons.\n\n \n\nSo, then when you have the bath in that situation, you get into it and go to sleep, just set a little alarm, cuz every 20 minutes, 20 to 23 minutes, you're going have to let about two inches out of the water, and then you put scalding water in and just keep it rotating.\n\n You don't have to put any more ingredients in, but you just reheat the water about every 20 minutes and that you do that consistently for as long as you're in there and you will keep the temperature regulated.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \n\nThe daily baths, do they have to be 102 to 105 too.\n\n Or can they be less?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nNo, it could be less, but it has to be at least 101?\n\n 101 is pretty lukewarm, you know.\n\n It's not very warm?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\n Do you walk after those baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYou don't have to?\n\n \n\nJust sweating on a daily basis if you sweat a lot in the summertime, that won't do it.\n\n It has to be the baths?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nThat helps, but most people don't perspire everywhere?\n\n In the baths you perspire everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIs it okay to take them at night, those 30-minute baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nThe 30-40 you can take any time of the day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIf you just wanna perspire the toxins out you can do the short baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYou can do the short baths to get it out, yeah?\n\n That'll just dump the toxins out of the connective tissue that you throw there on a daily basis.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nAnd that's safe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nThat's safe, yeah?\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (89) Swollen Ankles and Lupus \n \n \n\nSwollen ankles\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nSwollen ankles?\n\n \n\nIt depends on what the swollen ankles are from.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nI have lupus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nLupus.\n\n You don't have bad lupus?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nI don't know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nLet me tell you, lupus is a deterioration of the connective tissue.\n\n People who have lupus advanced, they can't even pick up a pencil without severe pain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nI was in the hospital, almost died with the kidney problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nUhuh.\n\n So, you got reversed.\n\n You reversed it on your own because medical profession doesn't know what to do with it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nRight now, I feel good.\n\n I don't take any medication.\n\n My ankle is all swollen and I don’t know why.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, just put those in hot water to make sure you keep perspiring out the toxins from the ankle.\n\n \n\nThat's about all you can do, but that's good, but put some coconut cream in that water, but let's say you have a gallon and a half of hot water.\n\n Immerse your foot in that and have about four tablespoons of coconut cream in it with some sea salt, and about a quarter cup of milk, raw milk, and that'll help.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (90) Teeth Whitening \n \n**[Jim]**\n \n\nWhat would you suggest for teeth whitening\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, Terramin clay with coconut cream is the best thing you can do?\n\n But just remember the teeth are discolored, if you don't drink tea and you're not drinking coffee and you're not smoking, most of the discoloration is coming from the brain through the nerve and the toxins are coming out.\n\n \n\nPenicillin is one of the greatest, tetracycline is another one.\n\n Tetracycline turns the teeth gray.\n\n Cocaine turns the teeth gray from the inside out.\n\n So, almost all discoloration comes from the inside out.\n\n So, no matter how much you brush and try to whiten, unless you put peroxide on there, like they whiten teeth with, but that damages the dentine about five to 10 layers in.\n\n \n\nSo, you're damaging your dentine.\n\n You're more likely to have cavities.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \n\nSo, you're saying use clay like a toothpaste.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYes?\n\n Use it with coconut cream.\n\n That'll help get rid of any stain that is a stain from food or from bacteria collecting, eating the food or the toxins that are coming from the brain and the body has used minerals to bind with them to cake on it.\n\n That's what plaque is.\n\n Plaque is toxins from the brain dumping out of the gums and the body using concentrated minerals to coat those, to keep them from damaging the dentine, and that is plaque.\n\n If you leave that plaque on too long, the toxins like the mercury, the thimerosal, the thalium,  the lead that comes out of the brain will eat through that.\n\n It will dominate even a massive amount of alkanalizing minerals and get through and damage the dentine.\n\n So, you still have to remove plaque.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nHow often do you brush with the coconut cream and clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWhenever you want?\n\n It's like jewelers Rouge.\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (91) Thyroid, Heavy Metals Cause Blood Pumping \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nMy heart starts racing sometimes when I fall asleep and it seems like it's related to my thyroid\n\n Cause if I take something for my thyroid, I don't have it, but it just hit me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWhat do you take for your thyroid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIt was like a supplement, like a thyroid gland?\n\n I know you hate it, but I've taken it.\n\n I've only take it like two, three times and then I'm okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nIs it the freeze-dried gland or is it some medication.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nNo, it's a freeze-dried gland?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, that's okay.\n\n That doesn't mean that that's causing that.\n\n That that's keeping the heart from racing.\n\n The heart is racing anytime poisons get into the blood, so faster the hard pumps during a time like that, it's very difficult for a heavy metal to settle anywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nSo, it's just a heavy metal that's coming from the bloodstream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nSoon as you lie down?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIt's like every night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nAs soon as you lie down, you have to understand, as soon as the sun goes down, your nerves start going into a detoxification.\n\n By midnight, detoxification of the nervous system is heavy, from midnight to 5:00AM.\n\n \n\nSo, you're going to bed at the time where it's just about starting heavily.\n\n You're getting all those metals into the blood, heart says, uhuhuh.\n\n You're gonna do that, I'm gonna have to pump and keep that blood moving until we get enough minerals in there to bind with those heavy metals, so they don't store and damage the heart.\n\n \n\nCause if they get stuck in the heart, what do they do.\n\n They'll cause a charlie horse in the heart, what's a charlie horse in the heart?\n\n Heart attack?\n\n And if you panic during a heart attack, you will die.\n\n Anybody who has heart attacks, do not panic.\n\n I've had 300 heart attacks when I had iAngina and I didn't die one, I passed out 50 times of the 300, but I didn't die.\n\n  \n\nBut you've got some heavy metals stuck in your heart muscle.\n\n You got that strychnine in there or whatever it was was, arsenic stored in your heart muscle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIt's been like that for two years, but my heart, you actually can feel it.\n\n You can see it pumping.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nActually, what you might wanna do is eat a lot of cheese before you go to bed.\n\n Make sure you have lots of minerals about maybe an hour and a half before you go to bed, lots of cheese and honey.\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (92) Tight Muscles From Not Exercsiing \n \n**[John]**\n \n\nYeah, I've been on the raw diet about seven years as you know, I'm going through signs of detoxifications and so on\n\n But one thing that hasn't really been resolved is like my body, I was very active in my twenties and thirties physically, and if I don't exercise regularly, my muscles just go tight.\n\n If I don't stretch, go to the gym, exercise, they just like, they're really tight, really pull my bones out of place.\n\n  \n\nIs there any kind of dietary recommendations to address that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nRemember, like I said to him, that's a mineralization, it's a crystallizing of old cauterized minerals in the body?\n\n \n\nIt takes 40 years to get all of those out of the system.\n\n The bones are the last thing and it takes five generations of bones to do that.\n\n That's almost 40 years.\n\n So, every day you're cleaning some of those out, and if they get stuck in the muscles, you're gonna get stiff.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (93) Trauma. Settle Down, Cream \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, anytime you have a trauma and distress, the main thing is to settle your heart, slow it down\n\n Cause the harder the heart pumps, the faster the heart pumps, the faster the blood goes through the kidneys and excite the adrenal glands.\n\n  \n\nSo, if you settle yourself down, breathe slowly and deeply do pranayama, inhale to a count of five, hold it to a count five, exhale to a count of five you'll force yourself to come down.\n\n Everything will settle.\n\n  \n\nAnd of course, to settle your nerves, the chemicals that are already rushing around in your body, drink about a half a cup of cream.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (94) TVs Given To Third World Countries \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nBelieves the crap that they're told on TV\n\n Bacteria's your enemy, it's your cause for disease and all this new generation buys it everywhere in the world, and they're indoctrinating these people because guess what.\n\n General electric and these companies are supplying TVs?\n\n Now I took a motorcycle, and went out all through Cambodia where there's nothing but people in grass huts, grass skirts, or their normal skirts, and they don't have much clothes on and they're kicking around a thatch ball.\n\n \n\nThey don't have anything, but yet everybody's got a fricking TV in their grass hut, and electricity going to it.\n\n They make 50 cents a day.\n\n The family makes 50 cents a day.\n\n How are they paying for this TV.\n\n Most of 'em don't have a refrigerator?\n\n The electricity is just to run the TV because what do they learn on TV.\n\nDrugs and, and junk food?\n\n \n\nAnd in Thailand you have 20 commercials every half hour.\n\n You have 16 to 17 minutes of commercials for every 12 minutes of program, and half of it is drug related.\n\n So, they're teaching these people that you don't trust the human body, that everything is wrong because it's of your body and trust chemicals.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n \n\nSo, the MMS, is it useless.\n\n Is it a toxic product to put in your body?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nAgain, it's a mineral, it's mined?\n\n It's for plants.\n\n If you got an average person who is very toxic and they mix it with some lemon or lime yep, and have it, it's going to act like an antibiotic in a way cause of the high chlorine.\n\n It's going to destroy some of their body's ability to cleanse itself.\n\n Is that good.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n \n\nNo, I don't think so?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nI don't think in the long run it is, for the short term it is cuz then they get rid of their symptoms.\n\n Then a malaria like symptom or disease will come up later, then how do they treat it.\n\n They just keep treating it?\n\n So, the person gets older and they may not live as long and they probably won't live as long.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (95) Vaginosis, \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nThe vagina and then it causes problems\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, you just have to wear a pad, something to block it.\n\n If you're that sensitive.\n\n**[Attendee],[unclear]**\n \n\nOr you come back and put \n inside the vagina.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYou're asking for trouble, \n\nAnything can mold that you put up there?\n\n Even the sea sponge will start molding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nWhat about the outside then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nLike I said, you can put something on the outside, a pad or put something in your underwear to cover it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nWhat about coconut cream.\n\n You mentioned with that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nCould I put that on the outside.\n\n \n\nWould that help?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYeah, it will help?\n\n Definitely will help.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nYou don't recommend that women use tampons.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nNo, I don't?\n\n I don't recommend that women use anything up them.\n\n \n\nTo collect the blood, I don't think that's a good idea, but you can put coconut cream up in you, coconut oil, things like that.\n\n I wouldn't use olive oil up in there cause that can be a little too acidic and prevent the mucus from forming as easily.\n\n \n\nSo, as a lubricant I use coconut cream, and boy does that work really well.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \n\nWhat about coconut oil?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nCoconut oil?\n\n It takes some of the sensitivity away because it's too heavy, so if you want that fine sensitivity feeling, use the coconut cream.\n\n Coconut oil will work.\n\n Sometimes it gets a little too hot.\n\n \n\nYou might cum too quickly with the coconut oil.\n\n So, premature ejaculation.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \n\nCoconut cream it is.\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (96) Vegans and Vegetarians \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nVery few people do well on vegetarian\n\n I've only met eight people out of 3,200 that did well on vegetarian.\n\n How do they do it.\n\n**[Attendee],[unclear]**\n \n\nI don't know why vegans have a big raw food \n?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYep, but it's all pretty new?\n\n I mean, David Wolfe, all of them, they're all pretty new.\n\n \n\nDavid's only been on the diet 7.\n\n5 years, and most people hit the wall at 7, but he has a high- all in those 8 people had high adrenal activity, thyroid and testosterone levels.\n\n Even the one female that I knew fit into that category, but she started deteriorating her spine at 36 years old.\n\n \n\nThe other men that I knew, the 8 of them, their spines started deteriorating in their fifties and sixties.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nAre you talking about David Wolfe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nI was talking about David Wolfe, yeah?\n\n So, David Wolf has just started eating dairy, and I'm not supposed to be telling people.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \n\n*Laughs* \n\n\n \n\nOne of the people who works for him called me and said, guess what.\n\n Everybody in New York City's changing, we're going to your diet?\n\n We're having bone loss; we're having a lot of problems.\n\n David Wolfe, I even saw him eating cheese the other day.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \n\nNo, you did not! \n\n\n \n\nRaw cheese.\n\n  \n\nNo, she was already on the diet and she was doing her meat around him in the closet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nCome out of the closet *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nNo, she won’t come out of the closet cuz he's a fanatic.\n\n You know, he doesn't admit that he's eating the cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nShe seen him eat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nShe saw him eat it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nThe cheese is not really a meat, the animals are not dead.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nIt's not vegan.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nBut it's not vegan.\n\n He advertises no dairy.\n\n So, now he's eating cheese because his spine's starting to go or he's getting very demineralized.\n\n \n\nHe's feeling very nervous and shaky, not calm.\n\n \n\nHe’s eating a lot of that stuff.\n\n All of that super food stuff is dehydrated garbage.\n\n It's gonna de-enzyme the body.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (97) Vegetaslbe Juice O Nweight Loss \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nSomething light that doesn't cause detoxification, like 90% celery, 10% parsley\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (98) Walnut Oil \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nWell, I was asking about walnut oil because I know you don't like vegetable oil, it hardens in the system\n\n Does Walnut oil do the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWalnut is a fruit oil?\n\n It won't harden as much as vegetables will, or as hard as seed oils will, but they still can be a problem in the body when they're concentrated.\n\n \n\nWhen you, when you get an oil, if you really want it to be digestible for the human body, you have to ferment it.\n\n Fermented Cod liver oil, fermented fish oils, fermented snake oil, fermented coconut oil.\n\n All of those things come from a fermentation process.\n\n Seal oil, it's very easy to ferment it.\n\n \n\nAll you do is take the seal meat and the blubber and you put it in a jar or the snake, you peel it and you wind it up in a glass jar and you let it sit in the refrigerator at about 48 degrees for five or six months, and the oil leaves the tissue, and then you have a pure oil that is fermented.\n\n \n\nIt has partially been broken down with the bacteria from the protein in the meat.\n\n Doesn't taste good, and it doesn't smell good, but it is certainly good for you.\n\n \n\nWalnut oil is just pressed, has no fermentation value to it.\n\n If you ferment the walnut first and then press it.\n\n Yes, you will get a good oil, but no, it won't taste good.\n\n Because once you ferment that kind of oil, it won't taste good.\n\n The only oil that tastes good after and during fermentation is coconut.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (99) Weight Loss, Carb Cravings \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nI find that when I get into the weight loss phase I just go like carb crazy like part way through the day, and I'm like *imitation*, and I just have to trouble in that transition\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nOkay.\n\n You're talking about my weight loss program from the book.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nOkay.\n\n Well, some people have a hard time with that one, so I've come up with another one.\n\n \n\nIt takes weight off a little too fast, so you need to slow it down if it's coming off too fast.\n\n Don't take advantage, I like people to be fat cause the fat protects your cells.\n\n If you don't have fat in there, all the poisons you breathe and take in your body, they'll go into your live cells and damage your cells.\n\n \n\nAnd that's where disease develops.\n\n That's where fibromyalgia pain everywhere, fatigue sets in.\n\n When your cells are damaged, you've got a problem.\n\n If you have lots of fat on your body, you're protected.\n\n So, there's my type of lady right there.\n\n Perfect.\n\n Healthy lady, so she is protected.\n\n She is healthier and you've heard of that fat and happy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nI've heard of dumb and happy?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nYou could be somehow too fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYou can’t be somehow too fat.\n\n Well, sometimes you can be too fat.\n\n It depends on where it all stores, if it's even like it is on her, it's perfect.\n\n On Jan, it's quite a bit in this area.\n\n She needs to take some of that fat that's a little too toxic.\n\n Get rid of it and put back on some better fat.\n\n  \n\nSo, a different weight loss method that's a little bit faster and usually easier for those people who can't- my weight loss in the book is designed to be slow.\n\n This one's quicker for those people who have trouble staying on a weight loss for long because all the cravings and the craziness goes on.\n\n \n\nSo, the first thing in the morning you have a vegetable juice, about eight ounces, no more.\n\n And in the vegetable juice, you have an egg in it.\n\n You whip an egg in it, not blend an egg in it, but whip an egg in it.\n\n Then every 30 minutes to 45 minutes, you eat a raw egg Rocky style or the way I do, suck it out of the shell.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nEvery 30 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nEvery 30 to 45 minutes?\n\n So, that means anywhere from 24 to 30 eggs a day, providing you’re sleeping about six hours a night.\n\n It's not easy to sleep as much as long when you're on a weight loss.\n\n So, you may get six hours in and then before you go to bed, now, if you really start getting weak, you need to throw at a cup of meat somewhere around six o'clock in the evening, then a cup of milk right before you go to bed and a cup of milk during the night.\n\n  \n\nYou do that diet and you'll take the weight off pretty quickly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nCup of milk in the middle of the night you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nOne cup of milk in the middle of the night, one cup of milk before you go to sleep?\n\n  \n\n Now the eggs, they're digested in 16 to 23 minutes.\n\n \n\nSo, it doesn't even get through the digestive tract.\n\n The digestive tract is all left alone.\n\n So, the only way he gets his food is from the lymph system delivering or the blood delivering the nutrients to the intestines.\n\n So, they don't have to work.\n\n They can be healed with the body because there's no time and no stress and no activity by digesting the egg or very little, the body starts eating up the fat in the body quickly.\n\n \n\nI've seen people lose 10 pounds a week on that.\n\n I saw one person lose 18 pounds a week on that, so it's very fast.\n\n, so don't go too wild on it.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (100) Weight Maintenance \n \n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nNow I was on this weight loss, I'm losing the weight\n\n Now, once I go down the required amount of weight, would I be going- is it stabilizing the weight or just gaining a weight again.\n\n What would be my diet be after I reach?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, it's summertime?\n\n If you take it off while we're still in the summertime you just go to weight maintenance.\n\n Then when it starts getting cold, then start gaining weight again.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nWhat would the weight maintenance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nWell, so your regular diet just with less fat.\n\n \n\nYou're on the weight loss right now, okay.\n\n  \n\nWhat did you do before you went on the weight loss?\n\n \n\nThat's what you do when you go on the weight maintenance?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nI don't know.\n\n It just phase me out.\n\n I forgot now in a way.\n\n Well, I'll have to talk to you.\n\n You'll be around.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nThen just call me at that time and I'll give you another diet.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nYeah, that's good.\n\n  .\n \n \n \n### (101) What Kind Of Meat \n \n**[Kathy]**\n \n\nWhat kind of meat should people eat\n\n Fish or chicken or beef?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nIt depends on what you need?\n\n It tells you how to make that decision in the book, We Want To Live.\n\n If you have a very high adrenaline system, you're hyperactive and lots of energy you need the white meats.\n\n  \n\nNow white is a misnomer.\n\n Don't consider white in the books as a color.\n\n It is just a category, and if you had salmon or tuna or ostrich, which is red as liver, that's in the white meat category.\n\n So, white is not a color.\n\n It's a category.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \n\nChicken is white.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \n\nYeah.\n\n Any poultry is in the white category.\n\n \n\n .\n \n \n \n### (102) What To Put On Cut \n \n**[2007],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nRaw steak on a dried crack, would that-\n⁠\n\nNo, it won't work\n\n It'll cause a acidity sometimes and it usually won't seal it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOnly a fresh tear or cut or scrape, but I always put the lime juice on first, coconut cream, honey, and then the meat on top of that.\n\n\nThat's the way I do it, and it works.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (103) White Tongue Dry Mouth \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWhen your body has a toxin in it, it uses a lot of calcium, phosphorous, potassium and magnesium to bind with the toxin\n\n The example is, you plaque on your teeth and why does the body build plaque on the teeth.\n\n Because when the brain detoxifies its heavy metals, it does it mainly out the gums and the tongue?\n\n\nThat's why you get that white crust on your tongue, that white plaque on your tongue.\n\n The body will take those heavy metals that are coming from the brain, cuz the brain uses a lot of heavy metals or metallic minerals to conduct electricity and transmit light, and that's how the brain communicates, just like a computer.\n\n\nSo, it takes metallic minerals to do that.\n\n So, when the metallic minerals are toxic from eating cooked foods or chemicals or any medications or preservatives, inorganic fertilizers, pollution in the air that.\n\n Most of it goes to the brain and the system, and when it dumps, it comes out the mouth.\n\n\nIt's why people shrivel in the face quicker than anywhere else cuz the brain is pulling the fats all in the face.\n\n When you're thirsty, it doesn't have anything to do with water, It's the fat being ripped out of your face.\n\n So, you put coconut cream or butter in your mouth, some kind of a good fat that can be readily absorbable, even the fat in honey, even though it's very small is an incredible fat and it will absorb into the body.\n\n\nIn fact, if you make a mixture of 6 to 9 parts coconut cream to one part honey, that's a great lip gloss and that'll take care of that dry mouth and cottonmouth and thirst.\n\n Also, takes wrinkles away from the mouth.\n\n \nSo, the minerals: the calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus will bind with those heavy metals as they're coming to the gum to try to protect your dentine.\n\n So, that's what plaque is, it's a protective coating of all those minerals.\n\n But look how many minerals it takes to do that, phenomenal amount, and if you're eating cooked foods, there's no way you'll ever keep up with that mineral loss.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (104) X Rays, How To Get Rid Of \n \n**[2007],[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nBy you taking the butter and the cheese and the honey out/\n\n\nShe asked was the x-ray is harmful to me, and would it use up nutrients\n\n Of course?\n\n That's why I didn't go back and I'm gonna wait till my leg completely heals before I do the other x-rays to show people how the leg can heal without medical help, but I'm gonna wait till the leg is completely healed because any x-ray slows healing.\n\n That's why I didn't want to have the x-ray, but the leg was in such bad shape, and I mean, it looked terrible.\n\n Knotted here.\n\n It looked like the leg has been completely twisted and broken.\n\n So, that's why I had the x-rays because I wanted it put back in place, but it was in place.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nSo, what do you just get rid of that x-ray poison.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nI ate the avocado and orange together?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\nOh, that's right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nTo get rid of the radiation.\n\n\nI didn't do that until after two weeks of eating the pineapple mixture.\n\n When I stopped eating the pineapple mixture, I started eating the avocado and orange together to get rid of the radiation, but I'm sure it slowed it down a bit, the healing process.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (105) Yeast Infection and Homemade Kefir \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\n\n\nIt hurts when it flares up\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, when you have that combination put a tablespoon of lime juice in it in.\n\n\nBecause remember, the urethra is the last tract of the urinary tract.\n\n So, it's going to be the last place to defend itself against any of those high yeasts, those fungus that you have in the body.\n\n\nShe was a vegetarian for a very, very, very long time.\n\n Full of all these sugars, that fungus feed on very easily.\n\n So, when you get down to the end of the urinary tract or any part of the body, it's going to receive fewer nutrient and, lime juice will help destroy fungus.\n\n So, just put a tablespoon of lime juice in there and the.\n\n \nThe formula that I give in the newsletter it's a less dangerous way of doing it and of using lime juice on a weekly basis.\n\n So, go with that if you want to destroy.\n\n If you've ever had antibiotics in your life, you wanna do that one day a week.\n\n \nThat formula on the newsletter for destroying fungus.\n\n\nYou put the lime juice, mix it in the cream and honey.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nAnd also, I need to say one thing about douching because I noticed, especially women that get bacteria in the back through the vagina area and I wanna if that also will help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nWell, you've got a lot of fungus that are still discarding into that area?\n\n\nSo, the best way to douche is to take a kefir that you've made, not a foreign kefir.\n\n You don't want to use a foreign kefir grain in this, you want the natural bacteria because the grain bacteria works against your natural bacteria.\n\n It will even eat the natural bacteria.\n\n The bacteria that grows in milk naturally will not do that.\n\n\nSo, that's why I like to just encourage honey.\n\n It helps those bacteria grow quickly.\n\n So, you just take that and dilute it with a little Gerolsteiner water.\n\n You don't shake it up.\n\n You just stir it just lightly in there, so you don't lose all the carbon, and then you douche with that.\n\n You can use a teaspoon of lemon and a teaspoon of lime juice mixed in the kefir before you mix it with the Gerolsteiner and then douche with that.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (106) You Can Exercsei Too Much \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\n\n\nWell, this diet, it is a miracle, but it isn't magical\n\n So, you still have to be reasonable.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI can't exercise too much as long as I keep my gut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nNo, you can exercise too much because you can spend all of your energy on exercise, then your body's not gonna heal and detoxify?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\nI was hoping to take a 1800 mile bike ride for two weeks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\nOkay.\n\n Then take off for a few weeks after, slow down for a few weeks after, maybe only do two hours a day after that for three or four weeks or a month, just to let your body catch up if you're gonna do something intense like that.\n\n\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Aajonus Accident \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOkay\n\n Hello everyone.\n\n Welcome to another potluck Q&A.\n\n First, I'm gonna start by talking about my accident.\n\n \"Accident\", there are no accidents.\n\n Let me start with what would I think caused the accident of course, calling to myself.\n\n  \r\nLast summer I was working on the third book, the detox book, and I'm saying to myself, I've had no serious accidents since I've been on this diet.\n\n I've only handled people with accidents, I really don't know what to do.\n\n I've had two serious accidents, because I didn't know how I'd handled the doctors.\n\n I didn't know what happened if I went unconscious, all these things and I got everything.\n\n I had got everything I had a question for.\n\n  \r\nSo, what happened was, um, I was in Thailand, which is a very small farm town.\n\n They have no chemical agriculture anywhere within 90 miles that I saw, and they're right on the Thailand, Cambodia and Laos borders right there.\n\n They're all just connected right there, and these two men that just came outta nowhere that are high in politics and everything in this town are trying to get me to build my health center there, and they're all throwing me 300 rai, which is 120 acres and it's on a river lake and it's got everything.\n\n \r\nSo, they took me out after they showed me the property and we went to a karaoke bar.\n\n Everybody drank, except me and they got snobbered, but we were close to the hotel, so I wasn't worried, and the guy was just driving slowly.\n\n \r\nI mean, we we're going like 25 miles an hour, it's like a 35 mile an hour zone, and everybody's talking, having fun.\n\n There's a driver and empty passenger seat and there's a monk, the monk was drunk too.\n\n And another passenger, and then my real estate broker, which I called my girlfriend.\n\n She's a friend who's a girl and she was sitting to the left of me.\n\n We're we're in an RV and I'm in the third seat with her.\n\n  \r\nI've got the seatbelt harness across this way, and all of a sudden everybody's talking and I'm looking at the scenery, like 1:15 in the morning.\n\n And I was looking around and I see this car coming with no lights about 50 miles an hour, hit us.\n\n And as soon as we came to the impact, I lost consciousness because the harness didn't keep me in because it was on this shoulder and we got hit on this side.\n\n \r\nSo, I flew this way, and my head hit the window, paste her because she was leaning forward otherwise, I would've smashed her and I wouldn't have been hurt as badly, but she would've been killed.\n\n \r\nBut I went over here and my head went through the window and caused a concussion.\n\n I've got a indent in my my skull there, broke the skull, and in fact, a piece of glass came out yesterday evening.\n\n Woke up this morning, oh what's this, piece of glass, but it had been completely buried.\n\n \r\nAnd my shoulder hit the side molding and broke the clavicle and the shoulder blade, and the collarbone.\n\n And the clavicle, when it broke, went through my neck muscles, through here and then bounced back.\n\n \r\nAnd then I was, I was out, I felt all that without pain.\n\n And then when I woke up, the RV was upside down, and that was an RV that hit us, we flipped over a couple of times.\n\n And when I woke about 40 minutes later, they're prying the doors open, and I'm barely coming to.\n\n I'm hearing all this going on and they're smashing the other window to pull me out because I'm in the back, and the girlfriend was on top of me and her feet, I guess, broke my ribs.\n\n I had two broken ribs here when we flipped over a few times, so she's in pretty bad shape.\n\n She got serious brain damage; she lost her vision.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nShe can get it back, can't she.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDon't know?\n\n She's not on the diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes she still have her personality.\n\n Is she still who she is?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, she's still there?\n\n She's not bubbly, and happy.\n\n But you know, she did something that I thought was rather ridiculous.\n\n After the accident we went to the hospital and, they were starting to break everything in the car to get me out because I'm way in the back.\n\n And they were able to pull her out to the door that they could they opened about this much.\n\n So, they were starting to break all these other windows and I'm getting glass across the eyes and face.\n\n So, I screamed at 'em to stop, and then I worked my way, even with this shoulder in excruciating pain, out through the door.\n\n \r\nAnd then I tried to stand up.\n\n I mean, all this time, my vision is not, I'm seeing, I'm not seeing, I'm seeing other things that aren't there, and my vision was just crazy for a while.\n\n And when I went to stand up out of the vehicle, it was an immediate collapse.\n\n They grabbed me, put me on the stretcher, strapped me in and took me to the hospital.\n\n \r\nSo, in the hospital, I said, I've gotta come to, I gotta really stay in tune, keep them from doing anything to me.\n\n So, so they put me in a wheelchair after I got off the gurney to have x-rays done.\n\n I told the guy, \"You have two shots to take\".\n\n \r\nSo, he took two shots and it showed the broken bones, but nothing was dislocated.\n\n So, they want to put a cast on.\n\n I said, don't need a cast because the body, when you don't have a cast, the body will build its own cast.\n\n \r\nIt builds, like you can see a tumor here, it's as hard as a rock and it's sealed right where the break was.\n\n And as it gets well, that bone growth goes back into the center of the bone and seals it harder.\n\n So, that's how the body does it naturally if you don't use a cast You have to be more careful so you don't dislocate.\n\n \r\nSo, I had to sleep on my right side for a few days and I took a very thin slices of steak and, wrapped up here on my neck and around here, so I slept for two days with steaks.\n\n Let me tell you, I was in excruciating pain and I put a steak on, within 10 minutes the pain would go away.\n\n \r\nI'd take the steak off or I'd fall asleep and it would fall off.\n\n I'd wake up in excruciating pain, put the steak back on, 10 - 20 minutes later the pains gone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow does that work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nJust does?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow did you discover that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's from the boxers?\n\n Boxers used to put steak on their injuries.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd your skull is better now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI had a huge bruise here and the ear was broken?\n\n All the cartilage was crushed and it's still just a little sore right here, and then I've got a huge indent right here, It's probably 2.\n\n5'' by 3/4''.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat did you say your girlfriend did that was stupid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, the next morning, we probably got to the hotel about 2:30 and we were sharing the same room, she had one bed and I had another bed, and I heard her 6:00 AM in the morning?\n\n She's going to get on the plane because she lives in Chiang Mai, which is 700 miles from where we were.\n\n \r\nShe had flown to Bangkok and then to where we were, and I had flown from Cambodia to Bangkok to where we were to look at that property, and she did not want to be stuck in a foreign town for her, so she got on a plane.\n\n You do not get on a plane when you have a concussion because the brain expands, causes pressure.\n\n \r\nSo, that probably caused more brain damage.\n\n She flew to Bangkok and Bangkok to Chiang Mai.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nShe couldn't stay back for a while.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe should have.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDid you tell her.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOf course I told her, so did the doctor?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThat's not smart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd then she wanted to see me before I left, so she flies back from Chiang Mai to see me and then has to fly back to Chiang Mai again.\n\n So, she just kept getting worse every time she got on plane, not a smart thing to do.\n\n Some people don't listen.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nGoing on the diet would change her back to feeling better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nProbably?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWas it difficult telling the doctors I only want this x-ray without want him to treat-  \r\n\n \r\nOh, they did.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAnd they don't say, \"Oh his head is not thinking right\", and trying.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I wouldn't let him touch my head, I didn't want them to know that I had a concussion.\n\n \r\nSo, I had to be clear by the time we got into the hospital room.\n\n So, we were in the emergency room.\n\n I was forced myself to think clearly, to stay focused, and I would only allow myself to drift in and out and get vision problems when I wasn't talking with the doctor.\n\n \r\nAnd first what they do is they went to everybody, \"Where do you hurt.\n\n\"?\n\n So, they look at everything that hurts and then they'll search other places if you let them.\n\n  \r\nI said, I'm not hurt anywhere.\n\n Here, here, here, but this is just bruises.\n\n It's a little knot there, and how it's got broken.\n\n Like I said, I don't know, I was unconscious when that happened?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDid you say how long it's gonna take for the pain to go away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMainly the pain is if I lift this arm, I used to not be able to not lift it at all?\n\n I couldn't move it for the first week, and I had to sleep on my right side for the first two days, I couldn't sleep on my back or stomach.\n\n \r\nAfter a day and a half, I was strong enough to get the Bangkok where my partners and other people I knew were, who knew my diet and knew how to get food and feed me.\n\n  \r\nThose people, I told them what I needed, they got me the very freshest meat.\n\n It was bushed within hours, like two hours, an hour and a half, sliced it very thinly for me.\n\n One of the Thai Wives did that and, they mixed my honey and butter because I had honey and butter with me and they brought me some unripe bananas.\n\n So, that's all I ate was the butter, honey and bananas and the butter and honey with the meat.\n\n \r\nI was well enough 36 hours to get on a plane and get back to Bangkok, and then I spent three days in the bed mainly there.\n\n I walked a few blocks a day to go to a massage place and they do Thai massage for like $8 for two hours.\n\n \r\nBut I have them do \"bao bao\", which means very softly generally.\n\n Otherwise, they get pretty tough, pretty strong.\n\n They start digging in.\n\n \r\nThen I met a new girlfriend, it was pretty hot and heavy, so the last two days we were heavily into sex, I knew I wasn't doing too badly.\n\n So, I got on a plane, I got stuck, the plane broke down in Japan.\n\n So, I got stuck in Japan for 14 hours at the airport, but they have a lounge there, their executive lounge with these benches.\n\n \r\nYou're pretty soft and comfortable, that's what I was using, but since the accident, they wheelchaired me into the airports, onto the plane, and then from the plane, they pick up my luggage and the whole thing.\n\n So that's how I returned, so I didn't have to lift anything cause there's no way I could lift even with this arm.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Went To Hospital To Undislocate Joint & Cant Do Anything About Brain Dmg \n \nBecause there's no way I'm listening\n\n \r\nEven though it's on allegedly pulled muscles, there are questions about your concern about your concussion and was like you.\n\n \r\nWere willing to.\n\n \r\nExpose their other wounds and hurts to the doctors rules about the concussion that bothered.\n\n \r\nThat you want to protect it from them and also it's like doctors.\n\n \r\nSeems like one of their skills that's useful is they can do things like you know, patch together nerves and certain triage, handling and stuff like that in the.\n\n \r\nPlease leave.\n\n \r\nBrain they can't do.\n\n \r\nA good job, but I mean.\n\n \r\nHow was your thought about your.\n\n \r\nWell, the only reason I was doing here was if something is dislocated?\n\n \r\nI needed to get the bones put back.\n\n \r\nIn place, right.\n\n \r\nThere was nothing dislocated?\n\n \r\nThey were broken four legs but nothing dislocated.\n\n \r\nThinking about your head daily.\n\n \r\nThere's nothing to dislocate.\n\n \r\nThere's only a bruise in the brain you've got.\n\n \r\nYou may have a blood clot and there's really nothing they can do about it, and anyway.\n\n \r\nOn this diet.\n\n \r\nYou can get a.\n\n \r\nBlood clot and break that.\n\n \r\nYeah, but you were confident that the dent wasn't significant, so that's what got.\n\n \r\nI mean, it wouldn't.\n\n \r\nEven the war.\n\n \r\nI knew that.\n\n \r\nThey would not be.\n\n \r\nAble to help.\n\n \r\nThat I just had to let my body clear.\n\n \r\nAnd if you had told them that you had.\n\n \r\nHurt your head.\n\n \r\nThey would have actually.\n\n \r\nYeah, no, that's what they did to the other field.\n\n \r\nAll all the other ones got concussions except for the monk.\n\n \r\nHe didn't get stuck.\n\n \r\nSecond thing was he was leaning against the door that.\n\n \r\nHe was here.\n\n \r\nYeah, in his head, everything was already solidly against so.\n\n \r\nHe didn't slam.\n\n \r\nI had to.\n\n \r\nI went from the passenger side this right side of the car.\n\n \r\nOnly the left side.\n\n \r\nOf the car when I called him.\n\n \r\nYeah, yeah.\n\n \r\nYeah, Yep.\n\n \r\nSo you know I had a huge impact.\n\n \r\nHe was right there all pushing up.\n\n \r\nAgainst the door.\n\n \r\nYou have great flexibility.\n\n \r\nLook great.\n\n \r\nI would agree.\n\n \r\nAll the way down here the bruises, bruises, our debt cells, mainly red blood cells that have been damaged, and they're coming out to skin.\n\n \r\nThe body throws it.\n\n \r\nOut to the.\n\n \r\nSkin doesn't can't take it all through.\n\n \r\nThe blood is in your blood would be quite thick and calculated.\n\n \r\nRank so sums it out.\n\n \r\nWhat do we.\n\n \r\nDo if something like?\n\n \r\nThis happens to us.\n\n \r\nWell, that's why I'm putting it in the book, so that's why when I was writing the book, I.\n\n \r\nHad these questions.\n\n \r\nWere all answered.\n\n \r\nYeah, so I can take people step by.\n\n \r\nStep you know through it.\n\n \r\nYou better phrase the question a little bit.\n\n \r\nSo I you know I.\n\n \r\nSaid I, I deliberately said.\n\n \r\nThat I knew it, but you know.\n\n \r\nI had no personal experience with severe accidents on this.\n\n \r\nSecond hammer in the jaw.\n\n \r\nWhat you won't do for science.\n\n \r\nLet's just say we want to do in the situation?\n\n \r\nWhere you know.\n\n \r\nYou're limited with food?\n\n \r\nYou're in a foreign place.\n\n \r\nI mean everything.\n\n \r\nI didn't know anybody there.\n\n \r\nDo you know any of these people.\n\n \r\nYou say you cannot have?\n\n \r\nA blood clot on this slide.\n\n \r\nIt's if you're following the diet rigidly, there's no.\n\n \r\nWay to get a blood clot.\n\n \r\nBecause everything is.\n\n \r\nPretty resilient and elastic, so it would stand without.\n\n \r\nCracking and breaking.\n\n \r\nSo when you really break something, you have a blood clot.\n\n \r\nIt means that you've ruptured something and it's broken.\n\n \r\nAnd and there's no elasticity.\n\n \r\nIt won't go back in place, so it creates.\n\n \r\nA A collapsed.\n\n \r\nVein or artery, and the blood will back up around that area and create a clock and will keep growing until the body.\n\n \r\nCuts the passage of blood off into that particular vein or artery.\n\n \r\nSo it can be the entire six months and have those into confident that your body works that.\n\n \r\nWay I wouldn't say six months.\n\n \r\nMaybe a year here.\n\n \r\nYeah, it's doubtful, but I can't say for sure.\n\n \r\nAnd that I could never find that because.\n\n \r\nI've been on fire.\n\n \r\nBut I got other people who had severe accidents.\n\n \r\nOne following been on the diet, probably.\n\n \r\nAbout nine months.\n\n \r\nAnd he had a severe bicycle accident.\n\n \r\nWhere he opened his head like I did on his, he took the skin off of the air and everything slipped.\n\n \r\nWe hit rock and his whole collarbone was broken.\n\n \r\nHe like mine, but the whole skin was taken off so he had a whole gap and shoulder here.\n\n \r\nThe skin gone so you know.\n\n \r\nHe repaired.\n\n \r\nIn about 6 weeks.\n\n \r\nAnd what I did was I had one pretty open cut on on my shin and on my chest.\n\n \r\nSo I took a piece of.\n\n \r\nMeat and put it over it like a bandage sealed up the next day I opened it and still with all.\n\n \r\nWe're talking skinless at the state, just looks like all the cells around were able to take all nutrients from the meat and rebuild that tissue that quickly overnight, talking overnight in about 12 hours.\n\n \r\nYeah wow.\n\n \r\nRight.\n\n \r\nYou know?\n\n \r\nI just I notice since I've been on this side?\n\n \r\nYou know it's been about four years.\n\n \r\nWould you.\n\n \r\nNot very much?\n\n \r\nWhat I found is.\n\n \r\nBand-aids stick to my skin.\n\n \r\nI can't use Band-aids anymore.\n\n \r\nHave you noticed that.\n\n \r\nI mean, it's like it's like something that's alive?\n\n \r\nYeah, that's right.\n\n \r\nIt's something that's alive in within my skin.\n\n \r\nIs like trying.\n\n \r\nTo learn from the chemicals in the.\n\n \r\nMandate or whatever and it's so stuck.\n\n \r\nRight.\n\n Like barely?\n\n \r\nYour body will absorb those he sits in their polymers.\n\n \r\nAnd then he.\n\n \r\nAll polymer.\n\n \r\nLet's use.\n\n \r\nAnd she might also.\n\n \r\nSomebody had a huge what do they call those.\n\n \r\nTabs are, you know, seeing skin tabs?\n\n \r\nTest net.\n\n \r\nYeah, we have the wards, huge works tag tag.\n\n \r\nI took a scissor cutting off and put the meat over 5 hours later and sealed.\n\n \r\nSchedule at 5.\n\n \r\nSo you know, kind of.\n\n \r\nYour finger just put meat on it.\n\n \r\nYeah, we're walking.\n\n \r\nAround so there's.\n\n \r\nA meeting part.\n\n \r\nAnd it has.\n\n \r\nTo be rich.\n\n \r\nI tried chicken.\n\n \r\nCop their liquor then.\n\n \r\nAt this level.\n\n \r\nBut you have to understand that island enzyme and the leaking.\n\n \r\nWe keep taking vitamin K, vitamin new outs and I'm not gonna not gonna get any bleeding.\n\n \r\nPut the lean on here.\n\n \r\nWe're going to monitor just putting the mean on.\n\n \r\nIt stops bleeding.\n\n \r\nKnockaround me just put brown.\n\n \r\nI took her out.\n\n \r\nOn the one here.\n\n \r\nI just smashed.\n\n \r\nAnd put it on.\n\n \r\nThat's cool.\n\n \r\nAnd it it.\n\n \r\nHere it infuse.\n\n \r\nLike you know, part of my.\n\n \r\nSystem that you.\n\n \r\nKnow, but I got in the bath and this came off and all the skin was already closed.\n\n \r\nDid you try.\n\n \r\nRight no?\n\n \r\nThis doesn't dry quickly?\n\n \r\nSo mixes blood.\n\n \r\nAnd somebody said your input, you're on a cut.\n\n \r\nHere's how I was.\n\n I I gave a seminar a lecture in Georgia 1981.\n\n I believe it says, and there is a retired police officer that 80 years old.\n\n That's about two people were asking you got your in there even.\n\n \r\nFreaking weird error.\n\n \r\nTo recycle your protein, a lot of people don't eat up those things and just the protein first time through to be drinking urine noted provide that a lot of Indians do that you can't get meet.\n\n \r\nYou know, maybe once a month or something like that they drink their urine frequently and in India.\n\n \r\nBut he was telling me that before 1928 on the on it was part of the Miami police force that if somebody, if you went to an accident where somebody had a severe cut jugular vein or anything they wanted the officer urinating.\n\n \r\nThe top one would pull on it, pull on the room.\n\n \r\nAnd while they held.\n\n \r\nIn 1928, the medical profession had alcohol.\n\n \r\nAnd said we watched thousands of people die in the next 20 years.\n\n \r\n'cause we.\n\n \r\nCouldn't do that?\n\n \r\nThey just putting pressure on it doesn't work, he said, but for some reason we.\n\n \r\nPulled that yarn on and.\n\n \r\nThat's just for a severe.\n\n \r\nThat was with himself.\n\n \r\nI've been doing this for last one year.\n\n \r\nI've been doing this.\n\n \r\nI drink.\n\n \r\nAt the top.\n\n \r\nSome people do that.\n\n \r\nI was in jail last week and.\n\n \r\nIs it.\n\n \r\nHold for 8 hours?\n\n \r\nAnd they have.\n\n \r\nRight.\n\n \r\nI was tricked by cops?\n\n \r\nI was walking the street.\n\n \r\nSomebody and woman asked me to.\n\n \r\nAnd then.\n\n \r\nTo leave and then they jump at the end.\n\n \r\nI saw anything big baby go I want second I won't be I.\n\n \r\nWant everything all.\n\n \r\nIn my car.\n\n \r\nSecond, everybody else was there also.\n\n \r\nYeah, they're all kids.\n\n \r\nThey're all being trained up.\n\n \r\nYeah, that's the other subject.\n\n \r\nWhat about.\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (3) Alkaline & Acidic Fruit \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nin the recipe book, you talk about combining fruits with chicken and fish\n\n \r\nAnd you say there's alkaline fruit.\n\n Say there's acid?\n\n\r\nAnd what are some other alkaline, other acidic cause I I try to combine them?\n\n \r\nBut then I wasn't sure if that was acidic or alkaline?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPeaches, melons, pears, they're all alkaline?\n\n\r\nAcid are your citrus fruits.\n\n\r\nSub acid are your apples.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nApples can you combine with chicken or not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (4) Bath Ingredients \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt barely gets it out, so if you take baths it's better if you put a couple of cups of milk in it with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar and couple of tablespoons of sea sal\n\n That neutralizes the poisons.\n\n**[Brainless Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about soaps and shampoos.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose are all poison?\n\n\r\nAnd they all get into the body.\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAs you let water out to get hotter water in the tub we need to add more milk and-\r\n\n\r\nNo, for some reason no, and I did it for three years of testing.\n\n \r\nFor some reason that's all it took.\n\n\r\nIf you don't wanna use milk and you only have coconut cream, then you use 2 ounces of coconut cream in the water.\n\n\r\nThat's even better for the skin.\n\n \r\nSpecially if you had candida or any kind of a fungus, you put 2 ounces of coconut cream in your bath and it just like coats everything you'll get rid of athletes foot, candida.\n\n\r\n2 ounces, 4 tablespoons of coconut cream\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bone Marrow Needs To Be Organic \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOK, what about eating bone marrow\n\n \r\nWould that help?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you have to get it from an organic animal?\n\n\r\nAnd that's difficult to get.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Buckwheat Pillows Leak Powder \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about buckwheat pillows\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSometimes that causes a little powdering after a little while and it causes allergies, some sneezing?\n\n If you're using the pillow for maybe a year before the fibers start opening up from use.\n\n They're fine, but for long term use it's not a good thing because it powders.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Cellulite - Vegetable Oils & Hot Bath \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCellulite\r\nCellulite  is usually- is always hardened fat that is full of toxic matter and it just keeps getting layers and layers of it thicker and it just turns into these balls, hardened balls\n\n\r\nSometimes they'll never even show until you go on this diet and the body starts puttig in solvents in their to dissolve it and all of a sudden you;ve got cellulite.\n\n\r\nIt's been there, you just haven't seen it.\n\n \r\nAnd when the body start dissolving it, it's getting rid of it.\n\n \r\nAnd it takes sweling to do that, because the solvents come around it, surround it and dissolve it.\n\n\r\nHot baths help remove it, if you take an hour and a 1/2 bath.\n\n You know 'cause a lot of times, vegetable oils are involved, that fat and vegetable oils once theyve been in the body awhile they'll never turn fluid again at body temperature.\n\n\r\nThe body has to be 102 to 105 degrees to get it to melt.\n\n So if you take a long bath and take some kind of a formula like you kno, if anybody wants to write this down.\n\n Depends on the size of person, 1/8th - 1/4 - 1/3 of an ich circular size of green pineapple.\n\nand mix it with two to three ounces of coconut cream.\n\n \r\nAnd 3 tablespoons of butter and 1-3 tablespoons of cows cream\r\nAnd a little bit off honey if you'd like.\n\n\r\nAnd you drink that before or right when you get in the bath.\n\n \r\nAnd when you get out of the bath you take a 45 minute to an hour walk.\n\n\r\nWhat the hot water will do, so you have to keep warming the tub every 20-30 minutes depending on what type of tub you have.\n\n \r\nTo keep the temperature between 102 and 105 degrees.\n\n \r\nSo they will soften all that cellulite so it will get soft, then that formula will start working into the lymph system and keep it from going too hard again once your body cools.\n\n \r\nSo when you do the walk in the exercise, you should also be bundled to be very hot.\n\n \r\nSo I wear wool underwear/silk underwear plus your clothes over that and you go out and do your walk.\n\n\r\nYou will perspire a lot of your poisons out, sweat it out.\n\n\r\nSo if you did that, lets say two days a week ,you would probably speed up the cellulite loss probably four years instead of 10 years.\n\n \r\nBut on this diet once you get rid of cellulite you never get it again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about drinking water during this time cause your sweating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's better to drink tomatoes and things that make solvents and won't disolve you?\n\n\r\nTake a bunch of like a quart of tomatoes and blend that with 2 ounces of cream and that's a better way to give you fluids to handle that.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, if you had to drink water, if you did that, they took the bath and everything it would probably take you about two and a half quarts of water to regulate your fluid level.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Century Eggs \n \n**[Aajonus],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI mean, when I was in Cambodia, they're selling them on the streetl, these black eggs that they pull up out of the ground-\r\n\n\r\nChina too!\r\n\n\r\nYeah, they're 25 years old, so it's $1000 an egg\n\n\r\nFull black or white mold.\n\n \r\nThis bacteria and these rich people can afford these, these rich oxygenarians.\n\n\r\nAnd they'll eat an egg and they will be able to have sex every day for- and ejaculate two or three times a day for a month.\n\n**[Audience]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n Oh wow!\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (9) Chiropractors Are Good \n \n \n \n \n### (10) Dont Use Casts \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow does a cast keep the self cast from happening\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you have movement there, the body will build it on its own.\n\n \r\nIf you don't, if you've got a cast on, there's no movement, so it doesn't develop.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo the best thing is don't have a cast on when you break a bone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, just be careful while this is still this is built that you don't dislocate that bone.\n\n\r\nYeah, why is to care.\n\n \r\nThe only place I took a big chance with that girlfriend I met when we go to the market?\n\n \r\nSo while rolling up to go to the market.\n\n I'm like, well I'm well enough to go to the market.\n\n Bangkok, you've got thousands of people elbowing- elbowing, so she had to go as a guard for the shoulders.\n\n\r\nPeople bump left and right, people dump everywhere.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWe should never go to a market in the situation.\n\n when your health is bad.\n\n Especially there?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight but she was my shield.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about a splint like they used to use, for broken arms.\n\n Is that okay do you think?\n\n\r\nWell, it will still keep the movement in your body from developing it's own?\n\n\r\nIt'll still cause less pain.\n\n\r\nEither use a splint or not, or a cast or not.\n\n It doesn't matter it's up to you.\n\n As long as the cast is plaster of paris you won't have a problem, but they are starting to make y'know.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Dont Use Own Fecal Matter \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNow, so you were talking about getting ecoli into the high meat situation by taking fecal matter, and you mentioned buffalo fecal matter and sort of just smeering it on a little bit and OK\n\n \r\nSo suppose I want to do that, so I take my own fecal matter, right.\n\n \r\nAre there are there any considerations?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't want to use your own fecal matter?\n\n\r\nYou have to use an organic animal, so it's completely pure.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy Would you not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n'cause you've got high containment?\n\n \r\nIf yo uhad been raised a raw fooder all of your life, it wouldn't be an issue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's a good thing I came here to ask you.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Drinking Urine & Too Acidic On This Diet \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, well I don't -I used to drink, when I was a vegetarian- \r\n\r\nI used to drink my urine because I had a problem digesting proper proteins\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I did drink my urine everyday.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut, when I started this diet, I had to stop because I got too acidic, and irritable.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd I would get fatigued from drinking it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about the homeopathic thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nA tincture from it?\n\n Well, every time they make a tincture, they use alcohol or some other ingredient to alter the chemistry?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt becomes a chemical.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, she was mentioning a homoeopathic preparation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAll homoeopathic's are just low dose drugs.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey have to use drugs; they always use some chemical.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAlways a chemical, alcohol or something else.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, Aajonus you were saying on this diet, you found that it wasn't beneficial to drink your urine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's because you get so much protein that the body is constantly detoxing the old stuff out of the tissues.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt could be and there's just too many toxins in the urine.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd some people still do it and they are okay, but most people I have found in experimentation it wasn't good.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd animals, you know- animals will drink their urine and eat their feces only if they don't get the proper foods.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOnce they get the proper foods, they stop eating it.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (13) Eat Unripe Fruit \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou always have to have fat with it\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you get the green stuff right, then you're getting less sugar and more enzymes.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it's much better, it's like the Thai's and the Cambodians and the Laus and the Bermeses and the Malaysians.\n\n They all eat very tart green mangoes and it's funny because it keeps them from having the lymphatic congestion which usually goes along with their kind of a high carbohydrate diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI like my bananas really green almost.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, that's the way to have them, bananas are a sub acid, like apple.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nMangoes are they acid or alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're alkaline, unless they're tart, then they're sub acid?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs banana a sweet fruit.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen it's green, they're not sweet at all?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut when they're ripe, they're really sweet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nReally sweet, high alkaline.\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, essentially fruit that's not really sweet- \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nIs much better for you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you do combine like a mango with chicken, is it bad.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOr is it just that it doesn't seem like what beef does, does it just convert it to fuel?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it's just in my experiments, I can't tell you why or how?\n\n  \r\n\r\nI just found that even if you mix a fruit that is semi ripe, not overly ripe.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf it's overly ripe, it's going to make fuel of your protein.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf it's semi-ripe or unripe and you mix it with white meats, it will still help generate tissue and heal quicker.\n\n But with red meats it doesn't.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe only thing you can get away with the red meats is the pineapple and the papaya.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, the red meat should be eaten by itself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, you can have it with tomatoes and other things, I've gotten recipe book?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know, what you can combine with red and white meats.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know and there are 82 sauces in there to make it enjoyable.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe 82 sauces can be made 3-5 different ways each, so it's about 400 sauces.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, find many sauces that are easy, but I mean you know somebody could eat a third of a pound of meat a day, but with the sauces they eat three pounds a day.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (14) Ecoli & Lactobacillus \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, I'm not going to give you pieces of information that will make it deadly for you\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAcidophilous.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAcidophilous is really a waste?\n\n \r\n\r\nAcidophilous normally is in milk.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want natural acidophilous, it breaks down the sugars only.\n\n \r\n\r\nBulgaris breaks down the fats and caucasus breaks down the protein, so you need all those bacteria.\n\n People say, oh, I take enemas and colonics, I'll drink lots of acidophilous.\n\n \r\n\r\nHello.\n\n Acidophilous doesn't exist in the bowel?\n\n \r\n\r\nE coli exists in the bowel, acidophilous exists in the small intestines in the stomach to digest milk fats and other sugars.\n\n \r\n\r\nBowel is a place to digest your proteins then.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNow the E.\n\ncoli survived the trip through the stomach acids and everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nE.\n\ncoli is generated in the bowel.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, no.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is, is that with the high meat, that's the reason that you're taking the high meat is for the E.\n\ncoli.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, that's for other bacteria, the E.\n\ncoli- you are not gonna have E.\n\ncoli in high meat, unless you take some fecal matter and spread it on it.\n\n \r\n\r\nI will do that if I want E.\n\ncoli on my meat and I want to breed E.\n\ncoli, I take some fecal matter from a cow, and I'll rub it on the meat and then I'll have E.\n\ncoli.\n\n \r\n\r\nOtherwise, E.\n\ncoli doesn't exist on meat, unless fecal matter touches it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut they'll survive the trip through the stomach.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid will destroy it here, but not in the bowel?\n\n  \r\n\r\nSee, you have most of your hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the intestinal tract.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou're going for other bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut the other bacteria are going to survive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, they're part of your small digestive tract?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut if you want to increase your E.\n\ncoli.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n I think it in a recent email you sent out, you talked about eating fecal matter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, but you have to eat fecal matter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut that's going to survive.\n\n Why would that survive?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause it gets so deep in the vegetable matter of the animal that's eaten it?\n\n \r\n\r\nYour hydrochloric acid won't penetrate it.\n\n It takes a certain kind of enzyme that only exists in herbivores.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSomebody needs to come out with a time release shit capsule.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*laughs* \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (15) Ecoli Disolves Tumors \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe situation with the Children hospital Toronto had been using E\n\ncoli for over 30 years now to completely dissolve human brain tumors in two - seven days.\n\n Including the vessels going through the veins.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd Yale's been using salmonella to dissolve other tumors.\n\n \r\n\r\nSalmonella, so with the medical profession and the pharmaceutical house wants you to get rid of all bacteria in your body, so you have to go to them.\n\n \r\n\r\nOne injection of that attenuated salmonella- bion products for the leture costs you $8000 dollars and you can just let an egg rot.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*laughs* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nJust let chicken rot and eat it.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen they attenuated the salmonella, so now it cuts off the oxygen to the tumor, but no longer eats the tumor.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, now what they do is charge you $12,000 for an injection of solvent to dissolve the tumor.\n\n \r\n\r\n$20,000 of treatment, when you can just eat high meat, high eggs and get rid of your cancer easily, at pennies.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAnybody that's interested in getting the large intestine with the contents, I also get that from the buffalo.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAajonus, what does attenuated mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAltered, genetically altered?\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, there's lots of people who have severe mass depression.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's usually because they don't digest proteins properly, so eating fecal matter gets rid of it the easiest, so does high meat, but fecal matter will get rid of it longer, creates a high.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nDo the metals affect the fecal matter.\n\n If I eat buffalo shit?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nStill, place where you need the breaking down heavy metals, it's not gonna get there.\n\n \r\n\r\nHot baths are the only way you're gonna get rid of yours, and cilantro.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (16) Eggs For Mucus \n \n \n \n \n### (17) Electricity & EMFs \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan I ask the next question\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nGo ahead?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAbout the electricity, the things that emit electricity.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm not clear- even though I know you've written about it.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat that electrical charge or there is- \r\n\r\nWhat is it and what does it do to the body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAny electrical field emits radiation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's it called.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's called tri-meter?\n\n \r\n\r\nThe Tri Meter can can gauge electromagnetic fields, radio waves and and other types like radiation from our microwaves.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\n\r\nI know a guy on the raw foods diet who actually does that professionally.\n\n He'll go to your house.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you can take that meter and you can put it on the computer or whatever and we can find out how far that field goes, it's damaging to the body 'cause it alters the molecular structure of cells.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe city Los Angeles, you know the Power Department, 10 years ago put out a warning with your electric bill saying it's been proved that electromagnetic fields alter the molecular structure of cells of animal cells, including human.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're using an electric blanket, do not sleep with it on, you turn it on to heat your bed, you turn it off before you get in.\n\n And let me tell you they would not have issued that it wasn't scientifically proved that it kills and damages, harmfully human cells.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd it's been proved anything over 3 gals is harmful.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's the measure for electromagnetic field.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (18) Fermented Dairy Vs High Meat \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about sauerkraut or acidophilus or even cheese, do they do the same thing as high meat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, well they do, but in a different way?\n\n  \r\nThe mold and cheese will help breakdown exterial and interstitial properties.\n\n That won't help with glands, it won't help with any of that.\n\n  \r\nBut it will help- and let's say you've got connective tissue with your skin, itwill help those areas, that bacteria, but it can affect you like candida, it can cause athletes foot, something like that, but those are good things.\n\n \r\nAthletes foots a good thing, but the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to believe that.\n\n \r\n'cause they want you have the chemical; they want you to eat the bad foods which cause it, that the farmers eat that bad food and they want you to keep buying their chemicals.\n\n \r\nSo they want you to have the fungi and they never create a drug that will completely get rid of your problem.\n\n  \r\nOnly one will take care of it for a few hours, or a day, so you have to keep taking the product.\n\n  \r\nIf you don't want athletes' foot or other kinds of diseases, you have to stop eating the foods which generates that kind of bacterial need.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Hair Gel = Egg White & Coconut Cream \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWould an egg white work in the gel\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nUhh, yeah egg white works in the gel?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nUse egg white as a gel.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, coconut cream is better to use as a gel, coconut cream is great.\n\n If you want it stiffer, jsut put a tiny bit of honey, put a drop of honey per two tablespoons of coconut cream, it will get firmer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen the bath water is warm, the milk curdles.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDo you find that it does.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nMaybe you're putting the milk in when the water is too hot?\n\n If I can't leave my hand in that water for five seconds my milk does not go in that water?\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (20) High Eggs \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, here's another aspect, umm the high eggs, how do you make the high eggs\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if you want to make them fast, you take the egg and tap it until you know it cracked?\n\n \r\nHairline crack so you can't see it and then you just let it sit in the sunshine or in a carton with the sunshine beating on the carton and usually takes about six weeks and you have some pretty rotten eggs, stinky eggs.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOnce the sun was so hot, I cooked the egg.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*laughs loudly* \r\n\n \r\nYou didn't have it inside a closed container.\n\n You had it exposed right to the sun.\n\n The sun hit the egg directly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHairline crack, 6 weeks, sun.\n\n Just leave it out no matter the weather.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if it's cold you don't wanna leave it out?\n\n You gotta be in a semi warm place, it can't be too cold, or it will retard the bacterial growth.\n\n That's why I don't refrigerate eggs.\n\n And the high eggs taste just like hardboiled eggs with a whole bottle of salt poured on them.\n\n (Aajonus cap.\n\n) \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (21) High Eggs Remove Drug Damaged Tissue \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's a lot more mature protein in the meat than in the egg\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, the meat is actually preferable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you got tissue that was damaged in your body from drug contamination, eggs are better?\n\n\r\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) High Meat & Bacteria Cant Help Metal Poisoning \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI wanted to ask about the high meat, yesterday you told me I have a condition that the high meat won't work as well, but then you said keep eating the high meat\n\n So, I wanted to know more about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n High meat for those that don't know is you take the meat and let it get full of bacteria until it stinky.\n\n \r\nHow many people saw me on Ripley's Believe It or Not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI missed it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNobody saw it.\n\n**[Jim],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWe wanted to record it- \r\n\n \r\nThey showed it again, I just got an email they showed it three times in the last three months?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhy didn't you forward it to us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause I was in Thailand?\n\n \r\nThey don't notify me, but they aired about 6 times since they made it a year and a half ago.\n\n Year and a half in July.\n\n They showed it on July 17th, the first time 2003 I think.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat TV station.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n2002, 2002 I guess it was?\n\n July 17th, 2002, that's the one I was originally on.\n\n So, if you ask him for a copy of that tape, he might be able to send it to you, but I took some meat and glands that were up to a year and three months old.\n\n  \r\nThey were black and green with mold and bacteria, and I ate about 2 cups that day.\n\n**[Attendee],[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n*laughs* \r\n\n \r\nWhat station did they air it on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRipley's Believe it or not?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYou don't know what station.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnyway, high meat is meat with high bacteria in it?\n\n What it does is it goes up and eats decay in the body, we're overly cleanly in our society.\n\n Anti-bacterial everything.\n\n  \r\nVapors in the air, pollution.\n\n Everything destroys bacteria in the body, so the body doesn't have those natural vultures and crows who go and eat up the toxic matter.\n\n \r\nSo, your body has to go and make solvents, which are viruses to go in and wash out the decay.\n\n  \r\nSo, it can help nurture these bacteria in the body to eat high meat.\n\n High meats will encourage the bacteria to help you clean easier with less decay.\n\n Because when bacteria or parasites eat decaying tissue, diseased or damaged tissue.\n\n  \r\nIt will reduce, it's like we eat 7 pounds of food a day and have less than a pound of fecal matter.\n\n \r\nAnd bacteria and parasites are the same way.\n\n Only they can take 100 times the matter, reduce it to one 1% of what they've eaten.\n\n \r\nSo, you've got very little waste matter if they're doing it.\n\n  \r\nYour body has to use a virus, which is a soap, a solvent, to clean it out.\n\n  \r\nThen you've got all this waste product that's accumulated 'cause there's nothing to reduce it.\n\n  \r\nViruses are not alive.\n\n The idea that they're contagious is absolutely the most ridiculous thing ever postulated.\n\n  \r\nThat's like saying tide soap is is contagious because it's in so many homes.\n\n  \r\nNo, virus are produced, their proteins, combinations of proteins that will dissolve matter.\n\n \r\nBut it takes lots of fluid in conjunction with that to spread out and dilute the poisons and to dissolve it.\n\n \r\nSo, you've got a lot more mass support, and that's why viral infections are usually a lot worse than bacterial infections because when you've got bacterial or a parasite, it reduces the waste in the contamination to a small amount of toxicity.\n\n  \r\nBut when you're using virus, it spreads all these contaminations and dilutes and permeates every part of your body.\n\n  \r\nYet 90% of all doctors give antibiotics for a virus.\n\n And the idea that you can vaccinate for a virus is the most absurd thing in the world.\n\n  \r\nIt's got to be alive man, and there's no life to a virus.\n\n So, it's an absurdity.\n\n So the high meat thing, I said that her condition, where she needs the bacteria, it's not going to grow in that area where she needs it most.\n\n \r\nBecause she's got metal poisoning, bacteria goes in there and eats a little bit of that decay and then the metal poisoning go and destroy that bacteria, so it can't thrive.\n\n \r\nThat's why so many people are getting so diseased, because there's so much pollution in their body, their bodies cannot utilize bacteria and parasites easily in their system, so they have to use virus, soaps, a solvent to dissolve all this matter.\n\n \r\nSo, people are getting sicker and sicker, and weaker and weaker all the time.\n\n \r\nBut if we just let bacteria, do it, keep ourselves clean and let bacteria do it, we heal like I do, quickly.\n\n \r\nThe doctor said that I wouldn't be able to move and work for six weeks.\n\n \r\nI was working within two weeks, I was working within a week actually, but not many.\n\n  \r\nYou know, hour or two hours at the time.\n\n  \r\nYesterday, I did full consults and even this morning I did a full consult before I came here.\n\n  \r\nAnd it's only been 18 days since the accident.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you take care of yourself, you will be much healthier.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, first you need to pull the metals out before the high meat can do it's work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCorrect, but there are areas in the body that don't have the metal poisoning and it will help with another area?\n\n \r\nBut the areas where you are the weakest is where you got all the metal poisoning and bacteria can't help you there.\n\n But bacteria can help you in other areas, so I was talking about that particular problem and high meat would not help that particular problem.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) High Meat Body Can Only Handle So Much Waste Product \n \n \n \n \n### (24) How Aajonus Heats His Bath \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I start the bath I will put scolding hot water halfway, and that heats up the entire tub and then 10 minutes later I'll go in and put cool water in til it brings it up to the level where I want\n\n\r\nThen I'll put all my ingredients in and let it set for 5-7 minutes and then I'll get in.\n\n\r\nThen the whole tub is already heated, so I won't cool quick, it might take a half hour to chill.\n\n**[Attendee],[unclear]**\n\r\n\n 104 degrees.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n102-105 degrees\r\n\n\r\nThat's too hot though?\n\n For the ingredients?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, 104-105 degrees the ingredients can take?\n\n\r\nHoney's the only thing that's affected at 98.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n104.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe'll, you should keep the honey at 104-105 degrees?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) How Much High Meat \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy question is again, how strict should we be\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's depends upon the person?\n\n \r\nIt depends upon the person, depends upon the person.\n\n \r\nI've seen people do the diet, 50% take away their problem and then continue 50% for their whole lives.\n\n \r\nMy parents are that way, you know they were both dying in their 60s, then I got them to eat half raw\r\nThey eat the raw olive oil, they'll eat the raw butter.\n\n\r\nThey don't won't eat the raw meat, but just my father ate it only when he was in pain with his knee transplant.\n\n \r\nAnd you know he was suffering for weeks and I told him the story.\n\n \r\nAnd I've been trying to get him to eat raw meat for 27 years, you know, and he ate the raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I'm talking about the rotten egg.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, you mean the high bacterial foods.\n\n It depends on what you want?\n\n It is a medicinal remedial thing.\n\n If you're in depression, eat a little everyday.\n\n\r\nIf you're not in depression, you want hormones to build and develop in your body.\n\n\r\nYou know, use it a couple times a week.\n\n \r\nOne high egg a month might do.\n\n\r\nIf I have one high egg a month it does me, otherwise I'm a sexual maniac.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n*laughs*\r\n\n\r\nSo, that's the best thing for sexual vigor then, the high eggs.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\nI mean for some people, their bodies are going to use it differently, but as you get healthier and eat more of the high eggs, you will have an excess?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) How Strict \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy question is,  how  strict do we need to be on this diet and how long\n\n \r\nIt depends upon the individual it's an individual situation?\n\n \r\nThe man who had the hip replacement they had the two years of suffering.\n\n  Year and three months or year and seven months or something like that.\n\n \r\nNo, year plus 3/4 of the year.\n\n \r\nSo it must be nine months, year, nine months of pain.\n\n \r\nHe did the diet probably 75%, but he made sure he ate a pound and a half of meat a day.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) How To Convince People To Do Diet \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do I do\n\n \r\nWell, how do I go in there, you know how do I begin to communicate with them?\n\n \r\nThe design that their doctors are giving them?\n\n**[unclear]**\n\r\nwhat they're doing, so I have to kind of watch myself and what I say.\n\n \r\nAnd you're working with them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhenever I'm dealing with a medical body like that.\n\n \r\nI take the facts with me?\n\n\r\nAnd in one of the chapters, the very last chapter I think it is in The Recipe For Living Without Disease.\n\n \r\nYeah, talks about all the universities that use raw milk to reverse diseases, and you can open their minds with that and they say oh you can reverse diabetes by drinking raw milk.\n\n\r\nAnd pasteurized milk causes diabetes, you know?\n\n \r\nAnd when you've got these tests going on, you start giving them that information.\n\n \r\nYou give them just a little bit of it at first.\n\n The weeks go by and they absorb that and they can't counter it.\n\n But it grows, starts growing like a plant in their brain.\n\n\r\nIt opens them up and then they want more and more.\n\n Some of them will just shut down.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) How To Repair Cartilage \n \n**[Attendee],[unclear] three weeks ago about this [unclear]**\n\r\nI've got a question, I pulled my back or \n\n\n\r\nThe problem you said is no cartilage.\n\n What can you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou rebuild it?\n\n Eating eggs and meat together.\n\n Let's say 20% chicken and 80% red meat, you make a steak tartar with red meat in it, that will do it quickly.\n\n\r\nYou have one meal like that and the pain will disappear by 50% within about an hour.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Importance Of Fat \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was in so much pain I couldn't eat much\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, can you give us an estimate how we need to be.\n\n Like I gained already 22 pounds, do I need more?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*laughs*\r\n\n\r\nWell, I would say no more than 5 more pounds?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight now to me, you're perfect.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nExcuse me, right now I am overweight, 30 pounds.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're perfect.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\nNooo.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm serious, I'll tell you a story, so you'll all understand.\n\n I was in Asheville, NC.\n\n Visiting patients.\n\n\r\nLast year, was September.\n\n \r\nNashville was full of these hippies from my era 40s and 50 years old, hippies.\n\n And they've all been long term vegetarians, they thought they were doing the right thing.\n\n\r\nYet, they're the sickest people I've seen.\n\n \r\nThen, this guy who looked like he'd been a motorcycle biker, you know, a gang member.\n\n\r\nWalks in and he's got all this adipose tissue all over his face like he's been a drug abuser for at least 25 years now calling for 30 years.\n\n \r\nHe was only about maybe 25 pounds overweight.\n\n \r\nAnd his coloring was pretty good, but his skin was a mess.\n\n\r\nI mean, as far as adipose tissue and the damage that was done in the skin, the scaring.\n\n\r\nWhen I looked at his irises, his insides were almost Immaculate.\n\n \r\nAnd all these people who were 30 year vegetarians who thought they were doing the right thing and heres this drug abuser.\n\n He'd been an alcoholic for 30 years and a drug abuser for 27 years.\n\n \r\nWe're talking cocaine, heroin, everything.\n\n \r\nAnd I said it doesn't make sense to me, how can this be.\n\n\r\nYou are only 25-30 pounds overweight?\n\n \r\nHe said, \"We'll, before I went on your diet 5 months ago I was 300 pounds\".\n\n\r\nFat absorbed poison.\n\n We know that scientifically because when you go into a body you find the poisons, the toxins wherever the fat is and it's mostly in glands and the fat tissue.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're fat your protected.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe lost 300 pounds on your diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n He was 300 pounds, he lost 120 pounds, 130 pounds.\n\n I said don't lose anymore.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nBut, if you're eating everything diet and you're not gaining weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you're not eating enough?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Joint Replacement \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBone loss, that's what we want to know about\n\n Bone loss in his hip from- the doctor said it's from chemotherapy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, so you've got a femur joint replacement.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe hasn't done it yet, that's what the doctor was saying?\n\n They even said it wasn't going to be effective, but it's the only thing that can help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, I have, even my father-\r\nA year ago, September, I was in Florida.\n\n \r\nAnd I was doing a seminar in Fort Lauderdale or West Palm Beach and.\n\n \r\nI said, you know, I've never been here to Florida before, yet they have like 7 people in this room.\n\n \r\nThey were all ages and their forts full of elderly people and I said how would you people find out about this diet.\n\n\r\nWhy are so many of you, you know, here?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*laughs*\r\n\n\r\nAnd one man stood up and said I had a hip replacement and I was in pain for two years?\n\n \r\nAnd they replaced it again and they did all kinds of things and nothing could stop it.\n\n \r\nDrugs wouldn't stop it, nothing.\n\n Then he said, \"I ate your meat for 10 days, *snap* raw meat 10 days and the pain was gone\".\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh my god!\r\n\n\r\nAnother guy stood up and said I had a knee replacement, same thing, he ate the raw meat, pain was gone *snap*.\n\n \r\nThese people have suffered for years with pain, raw meat, pain was gone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut does it have to be raw red meat or chicken and fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt should be a combination?\n\n \r\nYou have to understand that the bone marrow in the joint is is like butter.\n\n\r\nBut it is fed a lot by the red meat because the bone marrow breeds your red and white blood cells.\n\n So, for some reason red meat is still very important for the bone marrow.\n\n\r\nAnd the bone area is usually pushing off the poisons to the joint, which is causing the pain.\n\n And when your body gets the proteins, they can bind with those poisons, and then they're not irritating the joint.\n\n \r\nSo red meat in combination with-\r\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Laptop & Carpal Tunnel \n \n \n \n \n### (32) Lemon Juice Eats Into Stomach Mucus \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I wanna know more specifically about putting meat in lemon juice, like chicken and fish or whatever\n\n\r\nI did some fish recently and I had it in for about 5 days.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and the high meat.\n\n\r\nYou know, I, I thought it would be OK?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt may have been coincedental.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould it have something to do with the lemon juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you have too much lemon juice it's going to eat into your stomach mucus and if it starts eating into the stomach mucus and your mucus is very thin or short fibered, then it's going to cause burns of the stomach?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWas it organic lemons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't know, probably?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBecause I found that I got a stomach ache when I didn't use organic lemons.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Long Mucus Fibers = Fertile \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMusic has fibers in it, and it's like a mesh\n\n \r\nIt's like layers and layers of cloth.\n\n \r\nYou've got these fibers, protein fibers.\n\n\r\nWhen a woman was on her period or not fertile.\n\n\r\nYou can see the mucus fibers, you can take a mucus and it will pop!\r\nIt will only go a 1/16th to an 1/8th of an inch and then the fiber will break.\n\n\r\nThe mucus won't stay long.\n\n \r\nBut when she's fertile, those mucus fibers get very long and you can stretch them about that long before they break.\n\n\r\nThat's the difference and the longer the fibers and the more protection you have in the body.\n\n \r\nUsually women only develop that kind of mucus in their fertile period.\n\n\r\nOtherwise, the body usually creates it all the time that way if an animal is raw and healthy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut in other places in the body too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverywhere it will make it, but because the reproduction is so delicate, that gets the concentration?\n\n\r\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Mad Cow & Mad Deer Caused By Goverment Testing \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBy chemicals or those that are fed raw foods\n\n \r\nSo, the diseases that you know, like mad cow and mad deer disease.\n\n \r\nIt's a fallacy.\n\n \r\nThe military was going around doing chemical warfare testing in Wyoming, Utah, that entire area.\n\n\r\nAll through the 50s.\n\n\r\nAnd of course, those chemicals work over time, each generation keeps collecting more and it damages the system.\n\n\r\nYet the deer don't get crazy, their systems don't dissolve like that.\n\n\r\nThey found the prions in them and said, \"Oh, these are bad deer because we found the prion.\n\n\".\n\n\r\nBut, the deers brains weren't disolving, they didn't have- like the humans have CJD, which means that the brain starts melting andturns into a sponge.\n\n \r\nIt just dissolves and melts and the reason the cows have it is because they're injected with vaccines.\n\n \r\nThey have mercury in them, thimerisol.\n\n\r\nAll vaccines, and these cows are getting injections every month.\n\n \r\nSo that mercury starts collecting, and a lot of it in the brain and nervous system because mercury, especially liquid mercury has a propensity to go into the nervous system.\n\n\r\nSo, when it collects in these animals.\n\n\r\nAnd the worst diets that they have if they're eating byproducts of food processing, which is not food at all.\n\n \r\nNo life, no enzymes, no vitamins, nothing alive.\n\n They're eating this bad food an they're eating this mercury and there's nothing to prevent the mercury from dissolving the brain and nervous system.\n\n \r\nSo that's why there's mad cow.\n\n \r\nIt's not the prion that causes it, the prion is a result, not the fault.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNow, wouldn't you have to argue that a little bit further because I mean the initial breakout was like in England, right.\n\n \r\nSo, but I mean those practices have been going on in the United States for a long time, so how would you explain that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEngland's been vaccinating cows since the late 1800s, in this country it mainly started about 1950s?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you think it's a matter of longevity then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, there's actually documented evidence, you just have to find it on the internet?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Mattresses \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about rubber foam mattress\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey gas five years?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut latex.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLatex will gas for five years?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I thought it was natural.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, if they're using true rubber latex, but if they're using a polymer with it?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n\r\nLatex is a rubber, but a lot of times they're using polymers with, you know, plastic.\n\n  \r\n\r\nEpoxy, they are using epoxy to bind the rubber together and that's plastic, that's the thing that will gas the BPA.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I had a rubber mattress made, 100% latex, all-natural rubber.\n\n**[unclear]**\n constantly.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, what I did was I had an organic futon made to go on top of it.\n\n So, I used that as my spring.\n\n \r\n\r\n$1200 dollar box spring.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOrganic, but made of what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n100% organic cotton if you had it made, I had mine made?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThey have an option where you can do layer of wool on top, like a pillow of wool.\n\n So, would be as good as a futon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nActually, mine was made of 20% wool and 20% cotton because it sponges more, but it's all organic?\n\n \r\n\r\nBut, if you go to a company now, they'll want to charge almost $2000 for that, but I went to the futon company on LIBREA and I said OK, I want an all cotton- you know that particular mixture, but I want it all organic.\n\n \r\n\r\n\"So, we're gonna have to charge a lot of money for that\", it end up costing me only $600 for an 8-inch-thick queen size mattress.\n\n It would've cost me $2000.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut that was $400 more than their regular futons, so that was a great bargain.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I had to go buy my own material because all their materials are polyester, partially polyester.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I had to go buy a fabric.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd get the amount that I needed, the yardage that I needed and get down the material.\n\n But they built it all for me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, they have the organic filling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey were able to buy it, yep?\n\n So, I had two of them made because I have an outside bed and an inside.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI was just going to go with the 100% latex.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut the latex one, let me tell you, you will have trouble with perspiring, it molds.\n\n \r\n\r\nYour perspiration comes down and all of a sudden you have black mold, and it was horrific.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I made a futon to put on top and it was perfect.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, what's the percentage of cotton and wool in the futton.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n20% wool and 80% cotton?\n\n It keeps a better touch, it springs better.\n\n It feels really good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the best bed to get that doesn't have all these retardants.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThere's none.\n\n California has a law where you have to put borax or some other fire retardant in it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I invented a doctor and wrote a letter that said he's allergic to borax, do not put any fire retardant in it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, they made my futon without fire retardants in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's the only way to get it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's the only way to get it?\n\n \r\n\r\n'cause it is a law.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nEven organic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEven organic?\n\n Doesn't make a difference, they still have to put a fire retardant in it.\n\n \r\n\r\nUnless you can find a chiropractor that say's doctor on it, these guys don't know.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou get a note from a doctor, they won't put it in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy would you want to use a box spring.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause it makes it firm?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut you could find a cheap latex mattress if you don't care about a box spring, you can get it for like $700.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I don't like box springs because they have metal, and I'm very sensitive and I'll wake up with radio sounds going through my head in my sleep, so I don't like that.\n\n If a siren goes off 50 miles away, for some reason the metal will just drive it in my brain.\n\n So, I can't use any metal in my bed.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (36) Monsanto Wants All Natural Animals Dead \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd also, there's another factor involved\n\n \r\nDow, Monsanto, with some of the other genetic engineers, want all these natural animals dead.\n\n \r\nBecause they're allowed to develop genetically altered, even if it's just one gene they alter, they can patent that animal.\n\n\r\nPatient that animal!\r\nWhat happens with the patented crops.\n\n \r\nThere was a case two years ago in Canada?\n\n This guys got an organic farm.\n\n \r\nThe next door neighbor's got genetically grown crops.\n\n \r\nThe seed flies over to his, just along the border, Monsanto goes and sues the farmer for growing his crops, he wins!\r\nMonsanto wins, so this farmer has now lost his farm to DOW because he was growing- not purposely.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the reason they know that is because Monsanto whenever they do the growing, they send out guys that examine and take samples.\n\n It's just so evil I can't even.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd the courts are backing them up, so the same thing is happening with animals.\n\n \r\nIf you want an animal or a cow to grow it, and it's genetically engineered, guess who get's paid royalties.\n\n\r\nYou have to pay a percentage of every pound of meat that you sell to DOW or Monsanto?\n\nthey want to get rid of all these.\n\n \r\nThey want to get rid of all the natural cattle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo they had the death seeds that won't propagate right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what the next step is we'll patent men in the planet and  some won't have any viability.\n\n \r\nSo, if you want to become pregnant you have to buy sperm from Monsanto.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*laughs*\r\n\n\r\nThat's the way it's going\r\n\n\r\nIt's true, it's very true.\n\n If you want to breed your animals, they won't breed, so you have to go to Monsanto and they'll have them artificially inseminated.\n\n $10,000 implantation, that's if it takes.\n\n They're just greedy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) More Periods \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat produces hormones, right\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, if you're eating cooked foods, it depends upon the body, but you can produce poor hormone?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, poor hormone, but I was just wondering if those hormones could create a period, or if it's jsut natural hormones that create a period.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAny kinds of hormones can do it, but it's certain kinds of chemical constituents that get into those hormones that cause a cessation in menstruation?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThey said that it's not the eggs that they run out.\n\n It's something in the brain, within the brain channel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's a hormone change.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, I'm saying as women get older, they don't run out of eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI was just wondering if maybe sometimes the reason the women's having her period is because she's cleansing, as a way of cleansing her out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, that's normally- but all other animals, other than humans menstruate at the same thing when they are fertile?\n\n So, the eggs that don't get fertilized get dumped immediately.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's the flow, but humans because we've been eating cooked food so long, we have a different cycle.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWe have the fertilization period.\n\n  \r\n\r\nMenstruation that follows 12-15 days later.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's because of cooked food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, cause of the contamination in the body?\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou're talking about 10,000 years of change.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nI saw an interesting comment on that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThere's a technique called Lunaception.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd the idea, very briefly, was that women used to be in cycle with the moon, and with the new moon, and that they would all experience periods at the same time.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd what messed it up was interior lighting and unnatural lighting.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOne kind or another, and there's actually a little book out there called Lunaception, explains how you can utilize like a 40-Watt lightbulb or something like that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd just as you're sleeping, you synchronize the exposure of your skin with the new moon so that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know you have your light sticking out from under the cupboard or something like that and you'll go back in synchronization with the moon.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd there was this girl who had her period regularly since her first menses and suddenly we started doing this and then the first period was like way overdue and then settling within a week she had a second period, and it was really intense and the third period fell right on the new moon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, maybe the diet changed that cycle without the effects of using the light change.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, that could be true.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (38) New Book Eat Shit and Live \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou know, my fourth book will be called, \"Eat Shit and Live\"\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*laughs* *claps*\r\n\n\r\nIt's a comedy, spoofing everything that's backwards about your civilization.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Northstar Bison Not Organic Deworms Monthly and Females Are Vaccinated \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNorthstar bison is not organic\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut you recommend it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot for bone marrow and glands because they use de-wormers monthly and they give the females vaccines?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCause James is selling it down there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI know, I told James?\n\n James knows, he's selling it because he wants to offer it.\n\n He said if I can get some other sources, he'll carry the other sources, but the only sources I have are Cathy's, they're Cathy's sources, so I go to her.\n\n If somebody wants to find other sources, they have to do what Cathy does, search them out.\n\n Cathy's been very diligent in helping us do that, finding the best.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I always go for the highest quality.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThis is a woman who five years ago was catatonic and couldn't talk.\n\n Now you can't shut her up.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs profusely* .\n \n \n \n### (40) Nut Formula Brings Energy Down \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd he mentioned the nut formula too right\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the nut formula helps bind with excess hormone?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI see.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, the nut formulas not for somebody who has a low energy level.\n\n\r\nIf you've got psychological problems, yeah a little nut formula will help bind with those psychological, chemical by-products.\n\n\r\nIf you have too much nut formula, that's going to arrest a lot of hormones in the system and bring your adrenaline level, your energy level down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'll bring your energy level down if you eat too much nut butter.\n\n\r\nOK, 'cause I've just been like doing tons of nut butter and then I've gone without my period now for about 3 months?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you just keep arresting your own hormones.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, that's what's going on.\n\n That's what I was trying to figure out?\n\n I had this idea that the nut butter formula was helping my hormones.\n\n\r\nSo, what kind of foods do I need to eat to help my hormones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said, glands, any glands?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAny glands.\n\n \r\nAnd then just red meat and eggs won't do it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it will help, but if you want concentrated- glands produce hormones, that's why they're called glands.\n\n\r\nSo, if you get it gland, you're going to get a hormone, lot's of hormones within that gland.\n\n\r\nThe body can take any hormone as long as it's raw and convert it to another hormone.\n\n\r\nWe can take adrenaline and make it a pituitary.\n\n \r\nWe can take a pituitary and make it into adrenaline.\n\n\r\nYour body can convert any of them.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI was talking about two specialized glands, and that's the placenta and the ovary.\n\n When you age those glands, doesn't it reproduce the body to repair those tissues.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhen you take high ovaries or high placenta.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou mean for menstruation?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOr whatever you're doing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, If you're talking about the reproductive glands, then you can look to the reproductive glands to help.\n\n\r\nBut if you're looking for pituitary or adrenal, if you want the body to focus on that, then you need the adrenal gland.\n\n If it's the adrenal gland you want, then eat the adrenal.\n\n If it's the pituitary, then eat the pituitary.\n\n\r\nAmerican-Indians do that.\n\n\r\nThat's why anybody who had a disease of a particular gland, got the land of that animal.\n\n \r\nAny gland would help, but they knew that it would help that gland specifically to be eaten.\n\n\r\nThat's the gland you're having a problem.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Oysters Live On Sea Water Only \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, do you have a question\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I wanted to know?\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I went into the Ocean Ave seafood place yesterday, I was talking to the guy in the oyster bar, and he was saying that when the oysters come in.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhat he does, he takes cold water, he washes them through all around to take off the sand and any kind of smell.\n\n  \r\n\r\n'cause they always just come in very smelly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWell, I wanted to know, but since I've ate that oyster, is the water going through that oyster.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe oyster only eats one time a day, and it will only eat one time a day?\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd what it does is absorb seawater and it filters the sea water.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, when they wash it with city water, if that oyster absorbs any of the water will kill the oyster.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOyster cannot live on fresh water, especially contaminated by the city water.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo no, it was does not get into the oyster.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, should I hold it like this and slip it into my mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen they wash it off, it's all off.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAny water that comes out of the oyster is sea water.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, what I'm saying is when it drips.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen he watches it, it's early when he gets them in.\n\n So, anything dripping is going to be seawater.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, they'll do that in sushi bars, they'll open up the shell and wash the actual oyster meat beforehand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nTell them not to do it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, he washes it beforehand.\n\n Shelled.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe water on the shell, if there's any water on the shell by the time you get it, it's just the water from inside the oyster that's broken.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt so whenever I slip out like that and I can pour it out on the bowl \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, and drink it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay, so there's no city water then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's ocean water, the waters been highly filtered from the oysters?\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (42) Periods \n \n \n \n \n### (43) Pineapple & Papaya Okay To Eat With Red Meat \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you say pineapple and papaya are alkaline\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlkaline, no, but as I said, they will mix with red meat and still allow the meat to become a healer, a cell regenerator?\n\n So, it doesn't matter whether it's alkaline or acid, those are the two meats- probably because the bromelain, and the papain.\n\n The papain in the papaya, which is a protein that helps breakdown and disassemble protein.\n\n And the bromein in pineapple, which helps breakdown protein.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Polyurithane Plastic In Casts \n \nYou know, they are starting to put polymers in there, so they're putting polyurethane plastics in new casts\n\n That you don't want because it will gas into your arm, so you're not gonna heal properly.\n\n\r\n \r\n.\n

group cooked, one group raw and over that and over that period of 20 years, all the cats that were fed cooked meats and cooked dairy all got diseases.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAll the diseases of man.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd the cats that were fed all raw and had no diseases.\n\n Well, Howell wanted to do the same thing, but he didn't want to have the life expansion of a cat and all the cats lived 1/3 the normal life that they would live, if they weren't autopsied before, just to check their organs and everything.\n\n Because Pottenger let very few live their full lifespan, just a few in each group.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut Howell wanted to see how they will all live if they have their full lifetime.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, he used rats which lived three years normally, healthy rats.\n\n And he found that the rats who who were fed the cook food had all the diseases of man, the rats who had raw foods had no diseases.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut they all lived three years.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBoth groups, and boy that really confused him.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, he went around for a year, scratching his head trying to figure it out.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThen all of a sudden he realized a note that appeared every day.\n\n These rats are eating their fecal matter.\n\n And it's only the rats that were eating cooked foods.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, he redid the test, put a screen down and they only lived two years instead of three years, that's all.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, the fecal matter was very important for giving them protein because in the bowels your last stage of protein digestion.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's where the E.\n\ncoli converts those proteins into the b-vitamins and compound amino acids which backs up the nervous system.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why almost all animals eat fecal matter.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd get the E.\n\ncoli growing quickly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know, the pharmaceutical and medical profession wants you to believe that bacteria is the whole problem of everything when it's got nothing to do with bacteria.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAll animals have been living with bacteria for millions of years in complete harmony.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNo diseases, no death, but the pharmaceutical and the medical industry.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical runs the medical industry.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey dictate what happens in the schools and everything, so the doctors can't really blame them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou need to blame the pharmaceutical houses.\n\n So, they want you to believe that bacteria is your problem.\n\n And bacteria just occur as a consequence of disease but does not create disease.\n\n But they are calling it just the opposite.\n\n \r\n\r\nYet, all of their drugs create more diseases and there's no cure with the disease, and you go there route.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut if you look at other doctors of the period around Pasteur.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know who didn't believe in the germ theory, and believed in spontaneous, you know- \r\n\r\nSpontaneous eruption or transformation, or transmogrification of one life form to another.\n\n You could take a a certain bacteria and they can transform from a certain kind of salmonella to another form of bacteria and other type of amoeba that would help eat up certain decaying tissue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, there were studies where they ensure that the bacteria will convert rods to spirals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd so forth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nRight, and each one would have a different diet and it would clean up the garbage.\n\n So,these bacteria and parasites are very important for health if you're diseased.\n\n  \r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Refridgerated Eggs \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThe only way we can buy fertile eggs is if they are refrigerated when we get them\n\n \r\n\r\nIf we take them out and leave them out, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, they will start building up their bacteria again, and more protein will access?\n\n Yes, never refrigerate eggs.\n\n You gotta re-read the books.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, call your store.\n\n Find out when they get the eggs in, the eggs are never refrigerated until they are put on the truck.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe truck takes five hours at the most to get to the last stop, so it's only a few hours.\n\n Find out what day and what time the eggs come in.\n\n Go in that day and they have only been refrigerated a few hours.\n\n \r\n\r\nCause it takes them about 3 hours to get to the temperature where the law says that the eggs have to be delivered at a certain temperature, just like 48 degrees.\n\n  \r\n\r\nUsually, the trucks will take it lower because they want them to chill faster but cause the first delivery may be only 3 hours away from the house where they got the eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you shouldn't put the eggs in the refrigerator.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEggs should never be put in the refrigerator \r\n\r\n ?\n \n \n \n### (47) Rofling Mass Bad Light Touch Good \n \nRolfing is a very brutal, painful manipulation massage\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey will stick their entire thumb up your nose, and they'll work it and crack they'll everything.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd they'll dig in and they'll bruise, they bruise you! \r\n\r\nIf you've got any lymphatic congestion and lymphatic dryness, it will break all these canals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd what happens is you will bleed, and you will get all these serums in between.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat can lead to lupus, cancer, all kinds of problems.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou got lymphatic congestion; you can really push yourself into lymphoma quickly.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, Rolfing is the worst physical therapy that can be done.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe best physical therapy is light touch massage, it's like electric.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou just have somebody go like this over you *gestures*.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (48) Rubber Flip Flops Toxic and Nylon and Polyester BPAs \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRubber flip flops\n\n Not necessarily, are they truly rubber?\n\n Come from a rubber tree?\n\n Are they truly rubber or are we talking about nylon plastic?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIf they're nylon or plastic they're toxic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nToxic?\n\n They've got BPAs in them.\n\n BPAs are polymers.\n\n They're used to harden plastic.\n\n Tests came out 9 months ago showed that 82% of animals subjected to polymer gas, that leached from plastic, nylon clothes or anything, 82% of them got a brain tumor.\n\n  \r\n\r\nGuess what.\n\n They're allowed to use the BPA for another 5 years because ot the finances?\n\n Industry will go under and lose tremendous amounts of money if they can't put out this product.\n\n So, they have 5 years to find an alternative.\n\n Wow, babies get brain tumors and we'll all just get brain tumors, and other cancers because of these plastics.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you're gonna wear clothes, wear no nylon, no rayon, nothing, but silk, wool or cotton, period.\n\n Or linen.\n\n Those four, that is it.\n\n Everything else is cancer inducing, can you imagine.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, they flake, they dust?\n\n You look at the lint in your dryer, it's the same with natural as with any synthetic fibers.\n\n That gets into your lungs, that's plastic in your lungs.\n\n What do you have to do to break down plastic, it has to break down into a polymer.\n\n Everybody's breathing these and we've only had 20 years of it and each year there's less and less natural cloth available.\n\n So, you can imagine in the next 20 years, the amount of brain tumors children are going to have.\n\n Because that's all they've have is synthetic clothing.\n\n Plastic, constantly breathing plastic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, only cotton.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCotton, wool, silk, linen, and hemp?\n\n But I consider hemp a linen.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the shoes then, leather.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLeather or rubber?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut only leather or rubber.\n\n**[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n \r\n\r\nOr you could have \n or something like that?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about tennis shoes, you're wearing socks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, the plastic is still gonna gas?\n\n Whether you've got socks on or not, you're gonna have the gas infiltrate your foot.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (49) Shampoo \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect, but if I'm using if I want to make shampoo and I'm not using the coconut cream and the water, I use 2 ounces of vegetable juice, green vegetable juice, 2 ounces of milk if my hair is very dry\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt will condition the hair.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd a tablespoon of honey, tablespoon of coconut cream.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOr no milk and just a tablespoon of coconut cream to condition the hair and one egg.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's what I put on my hair dry.\n\n \r\n\r\nOr you could just use an egg, if you use an egg by itself, and you just wanna clear your hair with an egg, then wet your hair first before you put the egg in it, or your hair will smell like egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDon't you end up feeling a little greasy, I know when I get it on my skin it's really greasy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but once you get out of the bath and you take your towel over it, it doesn't leave an oily film on, it's just perfect.\n\n It's phenomenal.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, in the shampoo.\n\n How long do you keep the egg on first.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, if you're using the egg as your shampoo, you wet your hair first before you put the egg?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThen you put on the egg.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDepends, you can put it on 2 minutes?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nBut the vegetable juice and the coconut cream, you leave it on for 5 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I leave it on for about 5 minutes, but then I don't wet the hair first when I use that?\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have the vegetable juice and the coconut- \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI have the egg, the vegetable juice, the honey, and the milk.\n\n I don't wet my hair first.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThe coconut cream you said in place of milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI use a tablespoon of coconut cream in place of milk.\n\n If I'm using the vegetable juice, no matter what mixture, if I'm using the vegetable juice in it, I do not wet my hair first.\n\n If I'm using just egg, I wet the hair first, so my hair won't smell like egg.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIsn't that not good for a vagina for candida.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't have a vagina, so I don't know?\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\n*Extreme laughter* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, how are you gonna find out the answer to that one.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's not a problem?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n I thought the honey made it worse.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, what it does is it allows them to procreate faster and eat more of it, but when you get out and the coconut cream is into your skin, it just stops the candida?\n\n Smothers it.\n\n Takes the effects away.\n\n Or you you're not having coconut cream in your bath, then you put the primal facial body care cream from the recipe book.\n\n Put that on this area and the itching will go right away.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nBut if you don't put it on your scalp it won't get absorbed by your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt keeps leaking down from your shaft onto your scalp?\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (50) Shoes \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDo you see my shoes\n\n  \r\n\r\nWherever they are there, they're leather tennis shoes?\n\n  \r\n\r\nThese are not plastic, they are leather.\n\n All leather.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAre the soles pure rubber.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe sole is all rubber, and this is all leather?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut aren't they hot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI always get shoes that are half a size bigger than my foot, so theres lots of air cooling?\n\n**[Kathy],[unclear]**\n \r\n\r\nDo you know \n is leather.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI have no idea?\n\n Whenever I go into a store, I look what's there, what they're producing right now, and I find what's leather.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut I would say that shoes are the least of your problems.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (51) Strawberries Acid Others Alkaline \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about berries, are they alkaline or\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends upon the berry?\n\n Strawberries are acid, most of the other berries are alkaline.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, strawberries you could have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, with fish?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Testing For Radiation Blender and Fridges High \n \n**[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n \r\n\r\nMeter, you can see it and if you got a special \n would cost a fortune for one of those, and you can just take your meter and see\n\n \r\n\r\nProtect yourself, every time that meter costs $150/$130-$135.\n\n But let me tell you, for your health you can go around your house.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf your bed is near one of those fields, move it away from that field.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecause you've got the wires running through your house and some of them can be pretty bad.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, refrigerators are pretty intense.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, refrigerators and blenders.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBlenders are the worst, but we don't blend for very long.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why in my book I say blend 5 seconds.\n\n Maximum 30 seconds and you don't stand there.\n\n \r\n\r\nLooking at or holding it, you get away from it.\n\n But you have to really be exposed to those fields for four or five minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I run my blender with a keyboard actually.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\n*Vicious laughter* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's a good idea! Aajonus, have you heard that you can take a little portable transistor radio and tune it off of the station, so you just hear static and then that works like a meter.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, when you hear it getting more intense static, you know there's more.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that's certain fields.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nProbably for ionizing radiation.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (53) Too Much Sleep \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nMy sleeping problem has always been that I sleep way too much\n\n So, once I got on the diet my energy during the day is pretty good, but I do need like 9 or 10 hours sleep every day.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd if I go to bed late for some reason and I have to wake up early for something important it's one of the most difficult things for me.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's always been my whole life and I haven't noticed the change yet, even though I'm being, you know, pretty good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHow long.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nFebruary?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nFebruary, sometimes it takes much longer.\n\n 90% of healing happens in the sleep state.\n\n Normally, I only sleep 4 1/2 hours a day, total.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThree hours at night, half an hour to an hour during the day.\n\n Sometimes I goan hour and a half of sleep during the day continuously.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDuring this healing period, I'm sleeping 12, 14, 16 hours a day.\n\n  \r\n\r\nCan't heal quickly without sleep state.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen you know Cleopatra or beauty sleep.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat was true.\n\n  \r\n\r\nShe would force himself take an hour, 2-hour nap during a day to get her beauty, sleep.\n\n  \r\n\r\n'cause it rejuvenates the whole body.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, sleeping you should take advantage of because very few people heal like that.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut you know, once you're on the diet after a while, then you'll break through it.\n\n Now I've seen people who are very sick take three years to break that.\n\n Y'know, I've had one woman had- 28-year-old girl who had 30 tumors in the breast tumor in her right kidney attached to her adrenal gland in her hip bone.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know she's chronichally fatigued for eight years before she went on the diet and worked six hours a week, that's all she could work.\n\n \r\n\r\nSlept 12–14-hour days.\n\n After 2 1/2 years on the diet, that changed.\n\n Went down to 8 hour 8 1/2 most.\n\n \r\n\r\nNow, six years on the diet she sleeps maybe 6-8 hours.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd she goes all the time.\n\n All this energy, goes, goes, goes.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it depends upon your health and what's happening in your body but count your blessings if you can sleep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI've always felt envious of people who were really sharp in the morning that they don't need an alarm clock, they see the light coming through the window and they're up.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd for me I'm literally fighting the sheet.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI have words in my mind when waking up 'cause my mind wants to wake up and my body just can't wake up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou've got a low hormone.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou've got to eat a lot of butter with your meat.\n\n Butter and meat together, no matter what kind of meat it is, white or red.\n\n  \r\n\r\nChicken or fish, but a combination of all three along with butter will manifest- \r\n\r\nwill allow your body and help your body produce more hormones.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThen if you use cream or oliv.\n \n \n \n### (54) Toxic Fibers In Clothes & Blankets & Items \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I would say the shoes are the least of your problem\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be the clothes that lint's, and you're breathing it.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's the major problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou're breathing that plastic, I mean your in sheets, your bed.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know, I had to take my own sheets with me now because every hotel is buying synthetic sheets.\n\n  \r\n\r\n'cause you're breathing plastic.\n\n \r\n\r\nGuess what's going to happen to plastic when it start's melting in your lungs 'cause you have to melt it, your body has to dissolve it.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat means you got all these polymers and all these- \r\n\r\nYou got all these certain kinds of epoxies.\n\n You're going to have all those part made up of your lungs, it's going to be made up into your bronchial.\n\n It's going to go into your brain, it's going to go throughout your body.\n\n Stay away from plastic clothes, plastic sheets, plastic towels.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou're just asking for you know, disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhy do you think so many children are so diseased now.\n\n We're talking five out of 80 children now have a disease, serious disease at birth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're putting that fire retardant stuff in the beds too.\n\n In the pajamas for the babies.\n\n And in the futton mattresses.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBorax too.\n\n And you know the chemical and researchers behind it are going to the fire departments and saying use this fire retardant, this will save lives.\n\n Let's put it in clothing, let's put it in this and that for babies.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey know what it's going to do 'cause they've done the laboratory test, they know it's going to create disease.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI read an article, they found that fire retardant stuff in breast tissue and finally- \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYes, yeah it came out three months ago.\n\n  \r\n\r\nFire retardants increasing breast cancer by something about 12%.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (55) Vegetable Oils Are Rocks \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSauerkraut, that's a vegetable\n\n  \r\n\r\nYes, I encourage people to eat soured vegetable juice because it'll help go in and clean out.\n\n  \r\n\r\nthe vegetable oil.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's what I told these three yesterday during consult.\n\n \r\n\r\nHardening of the arteries and tissue in the body comes from vegetable oil, not animal fats.\n\n \r\n\r\nTake animal fat; butter, cream, any of them, put in with dirt.\n\n It'll mold and turn into Earth.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you take that vegetable oils and put them with dirt will turn into rock.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's what amber it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's most of your stones are.\n\n Your precious stones is plant fat \r\n\r\nUnder high pressure for a long time, and when you hydrogenizes a fat like hydrogenated peanut butter, or you know safflower oil and you user those.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou're basically creating rocks in your body.\n\n It will harden.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you heat the oil it has the same affect.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's worse, yeah?\n\n If you heat it, it's worse.\n\n If you hydrogenizes it's even worse because it forms the same molecular structure as plastic.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's how plastic was invented.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThis guy went to sleep when he was hydrogenating some fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nWent to sleep, it stayed six hours beyond it's normal hydrogenation.\n\n He had plastic, that's how plastic was invented.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, these fermented things like cabbage juice in small amounts will cause a internal cleansing and that's good.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (56) Water Is A Solvent \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYour fluid level\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you took tomatoes, one quart would be more than enough to do it.\n\n Plus, it wouldn't leach too much in your body.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou need a certain amount of water because water and most important solvent.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's so funny, even the medical profession, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't identify water as a solvent, but if you go into an archeologically and oceanographers.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey learned that water is an important solvent because you have to learn the properties of water and what it does to things in nature.\n\n  \r\n\r\nArchaeologists need to know, and oceanographers need to know that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, they're taught that water will just disintegrate anything that it combines with.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd that's it's property.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, when you put water into the body, it'll tear your body apart if you're drinking too much water.\n\n It'll leach minerals, vitamins, proteins from your system in your blood.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, water is not something to have too much of, it should be very minimal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about showers, bathing.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I take a bath every 5 days \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd not showers?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I have a well, so I'm up there in Malibu mountains, I've got my own well?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI've got my own well too, so that's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, that's okay, but if you have city water like the LA city water has 192 chemicals in it?\n\n \r\n\r\nPeople have shit and peed in it three times before you get it.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecause it comes all the way from the Colorado American Canal.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt comes down here, and it is used by Oxnard 1st and then it goes to the valley and then it goes to the community up here and then it goes to the lower, it's all recycled, it's all reconstituted.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (57) Weight Loss & Gain Cycles \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, then when I lose that weight\n\n  \r\n\r\nAm I losing the weight with the poisons or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, when you put the weight on?\n\n \r\n\r\nSee, I tell people in the recipe book every six months gain and lose the weight.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI only say that because men and women have this bizarre notion that once they gain the weight, it's going to be very hard to lose it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd it is for a lot of people were very toxic for the first two and a half years.\n\n \r\n\r\nI would rather people be on a two-and-a-half-year cycle.\n\n \r\n\r\nGet fat for 2 and a half years a then lose it.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut because people are so paranoid, it's easier to convince that if they can see what they're going to lose it in six months, and then gain it back again and lose it.\n\n They feel more comfortable, then after a few years of doing that, they don't care if the fat stays on for a year, two years.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey're not worried about being fat forever.\n\n \r\n\r\nThere are a few people that it's impossible for them to lose the weight, even no matter how hard they try, but it's only like .\n\n5% of all people I know on the diet.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd some people just don't want to, you know I was talking with a woman a couple of days ago and she says, \"I can't stand that I'm fat, but I'm so happy\".\n\n  \r\n\r\nShe says, \"Whenever I go on the weight loss program, I get unhappy.\n\n I look good, but I'm unhappy\".\n\n So, y'know, she says, \"I'm staying fat\".\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd fat for her is your size, to me that's not fat.\n\n \r\n\r\n But, to her that's very fat because she used to be a skinny girl.\n\n So, she'd rather be fat and happy, and I say great.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI can't tell names unless they're present.\n\n See you didn't agree to anything I said, so I didn't mention your name.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (58) What To Eat Before Bath \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, the ingredients to eat! The ingredients to eat before you go in the bath\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that's 1/8 to 1/3 of an inch thick circular slice green pineapple.\n\n \r\n\r\n-2 to 3 ounces of coconut cream.\n\n  \r\n\r\n-3 tablespoons of butter.\n\n  \r\n\r\n-One to three tablespoons of cow's cream.\n\n \r\n\r\n-Honey if you like, it's not necessary.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhat happens is the coconut cream, is an intense solvent.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWill dissolve matter, if you take, you know a lid from a canning jar that's been sitting around.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you put coconut cream on the canning jar lid, within an hour it turns black, so ripping up the metals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, coconut is a wonderful solvent to get rid of toxins and dissolve matter.\n\n So, you have the coconut cream in there.\n\n \r\n\r\nNow you need something to arrest those poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, the butter and cream is for that.\n\n It will bind with those poisons.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have those in place of the other fruit.\n\n You put those in the bath?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, that's what you're eating?\n\n To dissolve cellulite in your body, you have the pineapple, the coconut cream, the butter/cream mixture.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, that gets into your body, gets into your lymph system.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you're in the bath, it softens the fat in the lymph system.\n\n You've taken that formula inside the body and the lymph system feeds every cell in the body that isn't in the bloodstream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you're supposed to eat that an hour before you take a bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you're taking bath for an hour and a half, you take it right before you get in the bath or right when you get in the bath, so that is in your body and in your lymph system within an hour and a half?\n\n  \r\n\r\n[This was later corrected to consume the coconut cream/pineapple mixture with your afternoon fruit meal and take your bath in the evening.\n\n This allows it to be active in the system by the time you take the bath.\n\n] \r\n\r\nSo, then you're out of the Bath and then you do your exercise and it's permeating in the lymph system.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou don't do that kind of thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut, if you're on the weight loss, you don't take the formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou don't do that kind of thing on the weight loss?\n\n You don't do things for intense detoxification when you're on the weight loss.\n\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss is to get rid of fats that have already combined with poisons in your body.\n\n You do not want to cause more deep tissue detoxification while you're losing the weight because there's not enough blood fat to take care of those poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you want to get a copy of the tape from me.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's probably the best thing if you're not recording.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, sometimes she has to have things said in a different way.\n\n Her brain doesn't quite work.\n\n I'm the same way.\n\n I used to be the same way.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWait a minute.\n\n If you're having- you have to have one fruit or the other, you can't have a fruit at 1:30-2:00 and then have another one before you go in the bath.\n\n**[Again, this was changed to having baths in the afternoon],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYou do your bath in the afternoon, that's why I tell people to do the bath in the afternoon.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's your fruit meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, that's your fruit meal?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nHow many minutes before your bath do you have to take the fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou take it right before you get in the bath or soon as you get in and drink it while you're in the bath?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nOne tablespoon of coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n It's on there, just write it down.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (59) What To Eat High Meat With Alone 15 Mins Before Meat Meal \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you eat it alone\n\n Without anything else?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOn your tape you'll hear it?\n\n I told you to have butter, how much butter, how much cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, with the high meats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, the high meat.\n\n High meat is always eaten alone or with water.\n\n And 15 minutes before a meat meal.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) What To Use As Soap - Coconut Cream \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat do you use apart from water\n\n If you don't use soaps, what do you use?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nUmm, I use?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n it depends.\n\n If I use coconut cream and water, I just use a washcloth.\n\n  \r\n\r\n50 years ago, 80% of all the soaps in the world were made from coconut.\n\n Saturated fat could just dissolve dirt and grime and get's rid of it instantly.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, if I use coconut cream in the bath, then I'll just use the washcloth.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (61) Where Aajonus Is Going To Move and Healtrh Centre Plans \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPicture of how it's going\n\n So, I'm getting the frick out of this country.\n\n That's why I'm looking for land in Thailand and Cambodia, these places where it's still very primitive.\n\n Cambodia's phenomenal.\n\n I mean, they're still living in grass huts.\n\n  \r\nIn the major cities and there's like eight major cities, and even it's pretty primitive there.\n\n They're eating raw meat on the streets and everything's got flies on it, they've got no disease.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey butcher on the street too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, they butcher it and then bring it?\n\n They could cut some of the right there in front of you, flies are all over it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDon't you think the real war is here in the United States.\n\n \r\nThis is where the battles gonna be won or lost, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn Canada, here and England?\n\n Yeah.\n\n  \r\nWell, it's gonna be a long process cause I'm gonna build 12 health centers over the planet, but the place where I will probably live is the most primitive.\n\n And each one of these locations is gonna have a farm because that's part of the health center.\n\n So, it's gonna be completely self-sustaining solar generated everything, so were going to be doing a declaration of independence for each of these little centers.\n\n They're going to be like the Indians or like a certain religious sect where we can be completely autonomous.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you really want to live there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe United States is getting pretty bad?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo, but you personally must really want to leave.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNobody's gonna dictate the kind of health I can have?\n\n \r\nAbsolutely.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Whos Gonna Help When Aajonus Moves To Thailand \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOne other question\n\n  \r\nSo, who's gonna help us out with all this stuff when you move to Thailand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen I move to Thailand, it'll be at least three years, and I'll be there only three months at a time at the most because all of other clinics will be opening up?\n\n \r\nI will be at another one in probably Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\n So, there's gonna be 12 of 'em, so I'll be spending weeks in different ones, but I will have all the information in the books, and then I'll have a website eventually that's going to have every book on it, so you can run a search on it.\n\n \r\nSo, you'll pay to get on the website, pay monthly to get on the website, and you can put in whatever your problem is and you can put a search on it and it'll come up with every place that I mention it.\n\n So, you can be able to see information just like that, but that's gonna be about two years to develop it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut are you gonna see the patients here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey won't need me when I have all the information?\n\n That's what I'm working at.\n\n Everybody to be able to take care of themselves when I give everybody enough information, and they can address it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI meant to see the iridology.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that's if they want to know themselves, but I'm training other people, we'll be training other people to do that.\n\n  \r\nI charge you $8,000 tuition a year plus 20 hours a week of work.\n\n That involves one of my books, so you learn as you're working, but it's a three-year course.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAre you training like doctors or are you training regular people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm training only people who've had exposure to some kind of health principals?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, not necessarily doctors, but they're some kind of health professional.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n They've been some kind of nutritionist, therapist, somebody that knows the body, so they don't have to learn the body.\n\n All we have to know is the basics of the body.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, if you don't have a computer and your computer illiterate, then you're lost, huh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRight?\n\n Well, you won't be able to address it as easily.\n\n \r\nYou just have to go through the books and do it slowly.\n\n And you still have the access to the information, but you won't be able to address it in an instant.\n\n Could take you weeks to figure things out that would take you a day if you had a computer.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI don't have a computer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, he travels around with his telephone, so it's not like he's going to another galaxy.\n\n  \r\nShe needs some reassurance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI encourage everybody to be fat.\n\n I always would say that fat is protection.\n\n  \r\nIt was the accident.\n\n Took it off, lost like 20 pounds.\n\n I couldn't eat because I didn't have all the food, I had to rely upon.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Wife Wont Eat Chicken \n \n**[2004],[Jim]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, I have a bunch of questions, but one thing is no matter how I prepare chicken in all your recipes, my wife won't eat it, and I think she needs it\n\n I'll eat it.\n\n I like it.\n\n  \r\nWhat's what's going on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhy won't she eat it?\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nShe doesn't like it?\n\n Even if I do the tomato and chicken soup thing, extra honey in, it makes it like candy, she still won't.\n\n I don't know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDid you blend it.\n\n Did you take it and put it in a like 10% chicken with beef and put it together food processor and then make a dish of it?\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe'll never know it's in there.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nSo, just put it in a beef dish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nJust trick her?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, just only 10%.\n\n She won't be able to taste it.\n\n Any more than that, she'll taste it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBut that's kind of not without the person's consent.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHe's making the food for her and she wants it.\n\n She needs it.\n\n I've seen her as a patient.\n\n She needs it.\n\n I told her she needs it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, it's just a matter of she confronts it, she rejects it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but I have some clients who are that way and I tell them to blend it with red meat, and they'll never know.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) WOmen On Diet Get Period & Only Get Pregant 5 Days A Month \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, you're saying on the primal diet it's more likely the woman is gonna get her period again, rather than stop the period\n\n Have you ever had anyone say that they stopped having their period.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably had one that I remember, but I've had probably 40 women who were in menopause already, had gone through it, went on the diet and started menstruating?\n\n  In fact, one woman had a baby.\n\n She wanted to have a baby.\n\n She went through menopause, thought she was never gonna have a baby, and then started her period again, got pregnant.\n\n So, she had her baby at 56.\n\n \r\nJust remember women, you can only get pregnant five days a month, that is it, that is all.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

They eat grain all the time. Grain fed animals are fine. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI thought organic pastures fed them grass?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, they feed them some grain. \r\nWhenever they get milked, they get fed some grain. \r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nSo, it's okay to give grain to them?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nAbsolutely. \r\nThey're built to eat that. They're built to eat high carbs. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI just thought my knees swelling might've been from all the sugar from the grains.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, well, it's high in minerals. All milk is whether it's from a cow or goat, just from a goat there's even less fat than with a cow.\r\nYeah, but there's not enough fat to disperse and to get it out properly. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nHow come you went to New Mexico? \r\nAny reason? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nDoesn't matter.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\n85% percent of the time, the grain fed to animals is sprayed. It's toxic grain.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nWe're talking about grain is fine, but you're talking about pesticides and stuff like that. \r\nThat's something different, but you have to understand that most of the grasses that are fed these animals too. \r\n'cause they're fed alfalfa during the winter. You know, bales of alfalfa, 90% of its's sprayed too.\r\nJust like the grain.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nEven in New Zealand, in New Zealand?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n \n \n \nAajonus Can't Give Himself Parasites \n \nI could never breed them. \r\nYou know, I tried to spike myself with them and I couldn't get him to live.\r\nAfter the chemotherapy, I was so poisoned that anything that tried to live in my body would die. \r\n \n \n \nAajonus Eats Half A Pound Of Butter A Day \n \n[2004]\r\nDepends upon the  individual. \r\nI eat a half a cup a day. \r\nSo half a pound a day minimum.\r\nPlus my cream.\r\n \n \n \nAajonus Likes The Taste Of Grain Fed Beef \n \n \n \n \nAcid Reflux From Poisons Dumping Into Stomach \n \nThat's usually severe delipidization. \r\n\r\nMeans in your digested track and your sinuses, you may be dumping a lot of cauterized minerals from your days of cooked food.  \r\n\r\nSo, they store in your esophagus and in your sinus and your stomach.  \r\n\r\nWell, when you eat.  \r\n\r\nNo matter what you eat, the sinuses and the esophagus and the stomach will start dumping some of those into the food.  \r\n\r\nAcid reflux is that problem to the extreme.  \r\n\r\nSo, it'll dump it into whatever food you have.  \r\n\r\nThat's why I say you always need to eat fat with whatever food you're going to eat, so that those poisons don't go into the meat and the other nutrients because you won't be able to utilize them. \r\n\r\nOnce those portions get into there, they neutralize the acidity and the digested juices and destroy bacteria.  \r\n\r\nSo, the villa don't work properly anymore, so that food will not be digested.  \r\n\r\nSo, if you're eating butter, cream, eggs or something to fat with whatever food you're eating, so that fat will absorb those poisons so that you can utilize your food.  \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you will not.  \r\n\r\nYou're not likely to to digest and utilize very much of it.  \n \n \nAlzheimers Patients Forget To Drink Water \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nDo you have a question?\r\n[Attendee]\r\nUhh, yeah. I had a talk with this guy. \r\nHe claims that people with Alzheimer's disease drink very little water and so in order to cure this problem, he put them on a 20 day fast and they drink about a gallon a day of water. And he claims\r\nAnd he says talking to some of these people some of them haven't had a glass of water in 15 years.\r\nNow I know you don't like too much water. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nWell, in a situation like that, it's a temporary good fix because the water, like I said, is leaching. \r\nYou know, so they have a mineral buildup, if they a plaquing in their system that's blocking the neurological system, the lymph, or the circulatory system, the bloodstream. \r\nDrinking a lot of water like that can cause a lot of dissolution of that plaque, those minerals. \r\nBut also what does it do to the blood in the glandular system and everything else? \r\nSo, they might be able to get away with doing it once or twice in their life, but not as a regular thing. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nYeah, he's not doing this all the time.\r\nYeah, this this is a one time fix. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, it's a one time fix, but it won't relieve it forever. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nYeah, if they don't drink water, it may come back even.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nEven if they drink while it'll come back. \r\nBut it is a temporary fix that can be utilized in certain situations. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nBut the doctors don't have any solution\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThey don't have any solution to anything.\r\n \n \n \nBlack Plague From Toxins, Coal Factories, Mercury \n \n[Lewis] \r\n\r\nYeah, it runs the treatments that is that.  \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nIt's from the high toxicity in the person and then when they take a drug or medication it weakens their body.  \r\n\r\nAnd they usually go in anaphylaxis, which is a shock.  \r\n\r\nAnd they die.  \r\n\r\nBut of course the medical professionals isn't going to take blame for that.  \r\n\r\nBecause then you'd sue them.  \r\n\r\nAnd they'd be blamed for everything that they do cause.  \r\n\r\nTry to do that with.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nSo, if the person has rabies, that they just suffered the symptoms and never got an injection they could survive.  \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nCorrect. \r\n\r\nBut in the old days when they use to treat because you know you have foaming of the mouth because usually that particular bacteria is is familiar to the nervous system is like syphilis, so it can dissolve brain tissue quickly.  \r\n\r\nAnd if you've been a person who grew up, let's say.  \r\n\r\nA lot of people who got, you know lung disease, black lung disease were the people who lived in London around the smoking factories. \r\n\r\nSo, they got the black plague because they were around this heavy rlead and metal fog everyday breathing it, so lungs were heavily damaged. So, it wasn't the bacteria that was associated with the detoxification. There was the actual poison metals that were dissolving their lung tissue.  \r\n\r\nOf course, technology in those days you know you got silver, chalices and stuff like that.  \r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be gorgeous and beautiful, full of mercury.  \r\n\r\nGot the smelting factories around and everybody thinks it's advanced society, you know, so you don't want to give it up.  \r\n\r\nYou're not going to admit what it does.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nAnd the thing about historical stories that.... \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nYeah, it didn't have anything to do with it. \r\n\r\nSmoking factors and also when they were burning the cats, they were putting a lot of toxins in the air.  \r\n\r\nThey were burning everything.  \r\n\r\nJerusalem had it right. You know in Jerusalem during Christ time; the garbage collectors were the pigs.  \r\n\r\nThey were sacred.  \r\n\r\nYou could not eat them.  \r\n\r\nYou could not kill them; they'd run around the streets and-  \n \n \nBloodshot Eyes From Sleeping \n \n[2004]\r\n[Lewis]\r\nYes, I noticed I go into sleep about mid evening and that's fine. \r\nI know I'm detoxing and healing.\r\nAnd afterwards when I  wake up. \r\nI notice a lot of redness, bloodshot in my eyes.\r\nWhat is that?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThat's usually the brain detoxifying heavy metals out your tear ducts. \r\n[Lewis]\r\nRight since I've had a history of metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n \n \n \nBrain Has Most Toxins In The Body \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nThe toxins ago secrete out the eyes and the ears and the sinuses are all from the brain. \r\nAnd the brain has the most toxic collection of minerals than any other part of the body. \r\nYour body needs metallic metals and other minerals to transfer light, which is neurotic transmission.\r\nSo, the brain collects a lot of heavy metals. \r\nWhen they have to discharge, they discharge out the head, the throat, the gums. All that heavy plaquing on your teeth. \r\nThose are cauterized minerals, some cooked foods collected in the brain and they're discharging. \r\nAnd there may be bacteria in it, they're may not.\r\nDepending on how many cells are alive in your brain to be able to discharge some bacteria. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nIs there a remedy for that? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIs there a remedy? Lots of cheese with butter to relieve the constipation.\r\nEqual amounts of butter. \r\nYes, it is a cheesecake. \r\n \n \n \nCarpets \n \n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nNew carpets if you don't have cotton or wool carpets, you've got toxic plastic in your environments it's like wearing plastic clothes.  \r\n\r\nAnything that isn't cotton, silk, or wool; you are going to breathe plastic particles, lint! \r\n\r\nYou take a synthetic, whether it's some pine needles or whatever. You take the synthetic material, and you shake it in the light, you'll see all this plastic dust all over the place.  \r\n\r\nThe lint is plastic.  \r\n\r\nDo you think that your lungs can break that plastic down?  \r\n\r\nNo way! \r\n\r\nSo, your carpet. You see that the carpet in my house, the synthetic is covered with either wool or cotton carpet every year.  \r\n\r\n[Kathy] \r\n\r\nSo, you can't vacuum it out?  \r\n\r\nYou can't vacuum continually? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nYou'd have to vacuum 24 hours a day, all day long.  \r\n\r\n[Kathy] \r\n\r\nIt's not a carpet, it's a synthetic rug. \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nThat is a plastic epoxy that gets into your lungs.  \r\n\r\nIt's part of the fiber.  \r\n\r\nYou cannot digest that.  \r\n\r\nWe knowingly breathe plastic?  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nIs it okay if we use a natural organic wool? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nWell, if it's if it's from wool, period, if it's from an animal your body can break it down. \r\n\r\nIt's used to disassembling animal cells, whether it's hair or what. Our bodies spent millions of years adapting to that, the plastic no.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nLinen? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nYeah, but it will be a little bit more difficult because they use high heat to solidify it and the fats in vegetable oils harden in the human system. \r\n\r\nIt's harder to breakdown, it isn't as bad as plastic, but it's not as good. \r\n\r\nThank you.  \n \n \nCauses and Remedies For Eye Problems \n \n[Eric]\r\nEric, actually I had a real question and a quick novelty question that I think. \r\nThe real one is what's your take on the causes and the remedies for the atheroma's that sometimes people develop under their eyes or in various places like that that. Fat deposits.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nJust remember that poisons storing the fats. If your eyes, if your body is using your eyes as a detoxification center, the tear ducts. \r\nFatty deposits will normally form. \r\nIf they don't, you're in trouble. \r\nBecause the eyes will be terribly affected if they are, and you can see people with very bulging eyes. \r\nAnd then all this sunken around them, they usually end up with a severe eye condition later in life, that's high pressure and like glaucoma, and cause a lot of problems, headaches continually throughout their life, irritability. \r\nBut anywhere where you have fat collections. \r\nThat is the body throwing poisons into those areas.\r\nIf it's around the eyes. \r\nLike Laurie, when I first met her she had huge bags under her eyes.\r\nShe also cancer in three parts of her body, she was ultra thin. \r\nOver the years it's diminished. \r\nShe doesn't have that bulging.\r\nAnd her father had it too tremendously.\r\nNow, usually the toxins that go secrete out the eyes. \r\nAnd the ears-\r\n \n \n \nChlorine and Bromine In A Hot Tub \n \n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about hot tubs? They probably have bromine and chlorine in them. \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nWell, my hot tub back there. \r\n\r\nI just use sand in this filter. I don't use any chemicals, just sand in the filter \r\n\r\nYep, I use a 200 pound sand filter.  \r\n\r\nI like my algae. \r\n\r\nI breed the algae and make sure the algae is full in there. It's beneficial to the skin.  \r\n\r\nAnd it helps feed the skin.  \r\n\r\nIf the algae is eating the dead cells on the skin, then you don't need salmonella on the skin.  \r\n\r\nSalmonella dries me out too much.  \r\n\r\nBut that's our normal cleanser.  \r\n\r\nSalmonella eats the dead cells on your skin to break them off and get rid of them.  \r\n\r\nSo, salmonella is very important to have on the skin. But if you live in an environment where you can have algae eat those dead cells instead of the salmonella, then your skin doesn't get as dry, or my skin doesn't get as dry. \r\n\r\nNot right now, it's too hot. I use it to get cool right now.  \r\n\r\nAbout 105 degrees. Unless James gets in it, then it goes to 106-109. No one can sit in it, but him. *laughs*  \n \n \nCholesterol Book \n \n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nGood, you'll be healthier than most people. \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nI've been reading about that, but I feel absolutely the other way. \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nYeah, just get rid of It, propaganda. Like I said, get the book, it's called The Cholesterol Myth. \r\n\r\nYou read that book and you'll be cured.  \r\n\r\nGet that book and read it.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #2] \r\n\r\nI didn't hear the question. \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nShe said she has high cholesterol levels, and she worries about the high cholesterol levels because when she eats the diet it makes a higher cholesterol. \r\n\r\nDid you have a 700 cholesterol level? I might be concerned.  \r\n\r\nThat's a good amount. I like 350 to 400.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nHigh cholesterol's healthy? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nThat's right.  \r\n\r\nYou have to understand on this diet, even if you're not on this diet.  \r\n\r\nStill healthy to have a high cholesterol.  \r\n\r\nBecause the fats bind with the poisons.  \r\n\r\nIf you are fat deficient in your blood and you have a low fat level, guess where the poisons are going to go? Into the cells.  \r\n\r\nThe red and white blood cells, you're going to transfer less oxygen.  \r\n\r\nYou're going to have more problems.  \r\n\r\nSo, ahigh cholesterol level is good, it's just that the food industry like to jump on this thing about, well, we can sell now our foods calling them low cholesterol, like cereals and other garbage.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #3] \r\n\r\nWhat's the book called? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nThe Cholesterol Myth. It's referenced in my recipe book. \r\n\r\nOK, don't worry about be happy, because remember when you're on this diet, at least 50% of the cholesterols that are in your blood are going to be toxic ones that are on their way out.  \n \n \nCitrus Oil \n \nBut it won't harm him? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nOh, it could harm him, but it would healthfully harm him. \r\nYeah, but you know, usually in citrus oils, it's one of the most potent solvent oils. You use it to make turpentine.  \r\nYou know, so it's a very good solvent.  \r\nSo, while he's young, he's probably breaking some very toxic oils down from.  \r\nEspecially if he's eaten some cooked vegetables.  \r\nWe'll break it down.  \r\nMostly from citrus peel. \r\n \n \n \nClothing Detergent Biokleen \n \nNo, I use biokleen from grape seed oil, grapefruit seed oil.  \n \n \nCockroaches \n \n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nBut I never known.  \r\n\r\nAnybody on this raw diet that had a roach problem. \r\n\r\nI had a late summer.  \r\n\r\n[Kathy] \r\n\r\nAbout roaches, what do you do about roaches? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nCause I never had a roach problem before. \r\n\r\nWell, like I say, I been on this diet and even when I lived in Beverly Hills, they have the worst roach problem in the world they called Palmetto bugs in Beverly Hills. \r\n\r\nWell, let me tell you, I was in a in a building where the roaches, I mean big big roaches with 90 year old woman that had an apartment above me and her place was- I mean 1 drawer I opened... there were 1000 roaches in one drawer. \r\n\r\n1000. Under her sink there were at least 3000 roaches.  \r\n\r\nI had none in my apartment and my apartment was right next to her. \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nWell, what do you think explains it?  \r\n\r\nThe guy is not serial, they're outside of it, so.  \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nThey like cooked decaying food. Cooked decaying food is what they live on.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #2] \r\n\r\nThat's what she had all over her house? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nCooked, yeah. \r\n\r\nYep, they love that.  \r\n\r\nThey love cereals, they love anything cooked. \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nI heard if you leave a leaf on the floor, they'll be attracted, they'll smell that? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nThat's bullshit, that's bullshit. They love mold. \r\n\r\n[Attendee #2] \r\n\r\nI used to have an apartment, I had roaches and I knew they didn't clean it properly.  \r\n\r\nI pulled the stove out and it was filthy and once I cleaned under that stove, I had no more roaches, but in Hawaii, the roaches were so big you could put saddles on them. \r\n\r\nIt's a really good way if you really have a lot of roaches is you just get empty jars and you put a little bit of oil.  \r\n\r\nAny kind of oil like here on the inside of the jar only at the top and then you put a little bit of stale beer in the bottom, and they go in after the beer, but then they can't climb out cause of the oil and then they just fill up the jars.  \n \n \nCoconut Cream With Meat or Fruit \n \nIf I want to, I usually don't have coconut cream with meat\r\nI usually save my coconut cream to have with fruit in the afternoon.\r\n \n \n \nCod Liver Oil Solvent Extracted \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nIt's not raw.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nThat Jacob Miller has cod liver oil\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThere's no cod liver oil that isn't solvent processed.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nYou know I'm talking about. \r\nIs that he has a listing of items.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI don't care, that cod liver oil is just as toxic as any other.\r\nCold pressed doesn't make any difference with solvent treated. \r\nThey purify it with a solvent. \r\n \n \n \nCold Feet Takes 15 Years To Heal \n \n[Attendee]\r\nMy feet tend to be cold. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt's usually a bone marrow problem. So, the bone marrow in your feet are probably pretty acid and pretty toxic. So, that would be a matter of applying hot water bottles at night. \r\nGet the circulation to change, and that usually takes 10 to 15 years change. \r\nIt's a long one, it's a long and slow one. With me with my blood and bone cancer, the feet were the last thing to change and they did it in the last two years. \r\nThis particular ankle right here, the rest of my body could be completely warm, but this would feel like it came right out of the freezer. \r\nAnd I would have to wrap it, bundle it. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nNow it's better?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, now this last two years is the first winter where I didn't have a problem. \r\nIt's fine, yeah.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nCan you wear socks? You can't wear socks with it?\r\nYeah, you can wear socks. Anytime you want. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI'll tell you I bought these sandals 3 months ago and this is the first. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThey're warming up. \r\nIt takes a long time. \r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nWhat about numbness in your feet. \r\nIf you move your toes and it feels kinda numb.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nDead cells. Not enough fat to collect the toxicity, so it's gone into the nerves. \r\nNo cramping can be a mixture of a lot of different things.\r\nCramping can be dehydration. \r\nIt can be collection of toxic minerals, attractive substances too much carbohydrate byproducts, acrylamides that collect in the muscles. \r\n \n \n \nCold Pressed Coconut Oil \n \n[Attendee]\r\nThe organic cold pressed coconut. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThere's no such thing as unheated coconut. \r\nThey usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, that's bullshit.\r\n \n \n \nCows Dig Up Ground Eat Roots, etc \n \nBuffalo will pull up a whole field of potatoes if he gets ahold of one.\r\nPut it into a field of potatoes and the cow will dig it up. \r\nThat's why you put rings on the nose of pigs and cows.\r\n \n \n \nCream relievs urehtra pain \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nThe nervous system detoxifies when there's no light and at night time.\r\nIf you're in a climate you know like you're in, let's say, Finland. \r\nIn the summer, you know it's light all day long you will still detoxify. \r\nNormally when the sun is the lowest. \r\nAnd the nervous system detoxifies. \r\nLike I said, in the nervous system, in the brain. \r\nThat has the most free radicals, heavy metals. \r\nWhat happens if the free radicals touch cells, it burns them. \r\nGets into the blood, gets into the kidneys. \r\nGets into the bladder, causes irritation through the urethra into the bladder walls. \r\nYou have to relieve it, you have to get it out quickly. \r\nOnly way you can help resolve that is to drink a lot of cream before you go to sleep. \r\nThat will help ease it. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI've been drinking my juice before bed.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nEliminate the juice and have let's say, like 2-3 ounces of cream with your juice. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWell, not that much. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nOK, then you gotta cut it out because the minerals and the juice are helping you eliminate from the neurological system at night. \r\nIf you're not sleeping well, it would be better that you didn't detoxify that quickly. \r\nCream is always good to help. \r\nBind with those acrid minerals that cause irritation to the tissue. \r\n2-3 oz Yep, Yep. \r\nIf I drink a vegetable juice, I urinate 5 minutes later. With... intensity!\r\nSpecially now that I'm so thin. \r\nWhen I get the weight back on, it won't be as bad. \r\nWhen you're as thin as me, you can't even move with that kind of mineral toxicity.\r\n \n \n \nDetoxing old sugar with sugarcane juice \n \n[2004] \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nOK, alright OK we're gonna get started now.  \r\n\r\nNow first I'm gonna tell you the book that I've been working on next is detoxification.  \r\n\r\nAnd I get a lot of people from the Internet.  \r\n\r\nYou know the Yahoo groups who talk about heavy detoxification and doing heavy detoxification.  \r\n\r\nSo, my methods of detoxification are usually to take a food that you've eaten in the years of eating cooked foods.  \r\n\r\nYou ferment it and eat it. What you are doing is introducing bacteria that is absent in the food that you've eaten cooked.  \r\n\r\nSo, you've got no way to recycle it out of the body.  \r\n\r\nSo, your body has to make solvents like virus to dissolve that toxicity and remove it gradually, very gradually and slowly.  \r\n\r\nSo, in the detoxification book, I'm telling people how to gradually detoxify.  \r\n\r\nAnd that's why I'm taking those foods, how to ferment them and how to eat them and in what quantities.  \r\n\r\nSo, two weeks ago I decided to push the envelope to see how much of the detoxification was too much.  \r\n\r\n[Attendees] \r\n\r\n*Laughs* \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nI did it.  \r\n\r\nWhile I was in Vietnam three weeks ago, they have sugar cane juice.  \r\n\r\nYou could get it anywhere, almost anywhere in Asia, and of course I was a sugar junkie.  \r\n\r\nI was diabetic and I would put down a whole box of chocolate covered cherries in one afternoon.  \r\n\r\nYou know lots of candy and lots of powdered Donuts.  \r\n\r\nAnd I loved all that stuff.  \r\n\r\nI was a sugar freak. \r\n\r\nBecame diabetic.  \r\n\r\nSo, I decided that I was going to detox the sugar that has been in my system. \r\n\r\nSo, I fermented the sugar cane juice.  \r\n\r\nWell, I had diarrhea for about 5 days on and off.  \r\n\r\nWhile I was in Vietnam, during that I got tremendous hives everywhere and I used to get hives all the time so badly that it burned my skin and it'd blister, and scabs would fall off.  \r\n\r\nAnd it was mainly around my kidneys, all the places where a diabetic is most effected. \r\n\r\nSo, it was all along here, I had huge marks still coming out my ass. \r\n\r\nI lost mine complete ass, dropped in a week.  \r\n\r\nI had this beautiful round ass, and it was gone in a week.  \r\n\r\nBut sugar was stored in these tissues. It's not there! No ass! \r\n\r\nSecond thing to do, I was also a heavy milk drinker, pasteurized milk drinker.  \r\n\r\nSo, two weeks ago I decided to drink an intense amount of fermented milk.  \r\n\r\nThat was two weeks fermented, so it smelled like alcohol.  \r\n\r\nIt burned my lungs if I inhaled it. \r\n\r\nSo, I drank 2 ½ cups of it at one time. I was on the toilet for three days, 72 hours.  \r\n\r\n[Attendee] \r\n\r\nIs that raw milk? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nRaw milk. \r\n\r\nAnd again, it caused that kind of detoxification, but that wasn't my ass, lost my ass. \r\n\r\nI also lost about 20 pounds in about four days.  \r\n\r\nSo, I put 10 pounds back on, so I don't look so bad as I did four days ago, but he kicked my butt, so I kind of see the limitation.  \r\n\r\nSo, all these people on the Internet who say go for it.  \r\n\r\nHeavy detoxifications, I don't suggest to do. Not unless you're 50 pounds overweight.  \r\n\r\nYou can afford to lose that much weight.  \r\n\r\nIt was too much for me to lose, I was debilitated.  \r\n\r\nI could barely move for about two or five days.  \r\n\r\nYou know, just diarrhea and the exhaustion and the weight loss.  \r\n\r\nAnd getting back up to this weight, I've been eating all day long every day.  \r\n\r\nFood and food and food and food and cheesecakes galore. \r\n\r\nAnd cheesecakes help absorb that toxicity.  \r\n\r\nI had less rashes, less hives when I would eat the cheesecake, so I'd make a cheesecake for about 3 days.  \r\n\r\nAnd eat pieces all along the day throughout the day. \r\n\r\nSo, that's what I have to say about the detoxification before the book comes out. Don't push anything too heavily. You're going to ferment something to detoxify that that's in your body, something you've eaten a lot of in your past life, cooked life. \r\n\r\nNo more than an ounce or two ounce every time with that particular food. \r\n\r\nDon't push it.  \r\n\r\nUnless, you know you've got a lot of weight.  \r\n\r\nYou know, then you could probably afford to do it, but still, if you have to work, you're not going to be able to function very well.  \r\n\r\nIf you have that kind of a detoxification, OK, any questions about that? \r\n\r\n[Jeff] \r\n\r\nEven if you eat something from your past, is it necessarily pulling out the old stuff? \r\n\r\n[Aajonus] \r\n\r\nWell, what I did was I had some of my feces checked while I was in Vietnam. \r\n\r\nI got a laboratory to check it and it was a lot of old toxic cauterized sugar in there from that.  \r\n\r\nAnd here it was metals.  \r\n\r\nWhen I had the milk, it caused a bunch of metals to come out of my system.  \r\n\r\nAnd I started forming stones in my urine.  \r\n\r\nYou know, so it caused a heavy mineral detoxification.  \n \n \nDetoxing through skin, dry skin etc \n \n[Attendee]\r\nTell us a bit about it because detoxing through the skin. Can it cause symptoms like dry skin, itchy skin, chapped lips and warts?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nAbsolutely. That's why I like the primal facial body care cream. If you're going through any kind of a skin detox, any kind of a rash, dry skin period. Poisons are leaving through your skin. \r\nIn an intense amount it's drying out the surrounding cells. There's not enough fat in those cells, so when the toxin moves past it, it draws the fat outt of that cell and that cell will crack and damage and scar.\r\nSo, with the primal facial body care cream on. It will be able to be absorbed into the surrounding cells. So, you don't have as much damage. I mean, if I hadn't put that on these areas, I would have huge sores and huge scars.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nYou make it up?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, you make it up, it's on page 145 of the recipe book.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nHow long is it good for?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI've had it up to six months in the refrigerator.\r\nI've had it up to two months out of the refrigerator in a climate like Thailand at the \r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nThrow it away after?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, I've always used it within six months.\r\n \n \n \nDiet For Over Acidic Gums \n \n[Attendee]\r\nAnd what about the gums and stuff? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nGums, you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system, going out the teeth. So keep honey and butter in your mouth. You absorb those acids. \r\nOr cream, keep a little bit of cream in your mouth. \r\nHoney/butter mixture. It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth.\r\n \n \n \nDifferent meat sdifferent bacteria \n \n[Kathy]\r\nThen why are you going into different meats to make high chicken, high beef, all these other things.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nBecause there's a different bacteria for each meat, there are thousands of bacteria, which you want to try to get them all going. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nHigh fish will help you digest fish, right?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYes, correct. There's a whole array of bacteria for each meat. And if you breed those and introduce those to your body, you're going to digest that.\r\n \n \n \nDon't Drink Vege Juice At Night \n \n[Attendee]\r\nCan you say you prefer the green juice before you go to bed?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt all depends upon the individual. I give guidelines in the book, four juices a day, one before you go to sleep at night. If you're a person who gets hyperactive from drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice. You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, and go to sleep.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nIn the middle of the night, take a milkshake.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf you wake. Yeah.\r\n \n \n \nDon't Go Longer Than 5 Hours Without Eating \n \n \n \n \nDon't Sit In Sun With Dry Skin \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nWell, if your skin is dry, you don't want to sit in the sun without the Primal Facial Body Care Cream or coconut cream. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat about coconut oil? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf it's raw coconut oil that you make yourself, it's great. That's what the natives always used for thousands and thousands of years, just break coconut juice. They would grate the coconut meat and ring out the fat, apply it and eat it.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nThe organic cold pressed coconut.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThere's no such thing as unheated coconut. They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, bullshit, not raw.\r\n \n \n \nH Pylori \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nH. Pylori is part of the stomach lining, we've had it for billions of years, all animals. Again, the medical profession is trying to blame everything that's disease on bacteria, but we lived with these bacteria for millions of years without disease. Why is everybody getting ulcers now. Ulcers were unheard of before coffee became into existence.\r\nNow that coffees around, ulcers are normal thing. And again, if you have an ulcer, you're going to have pylori bacteria in the tissue, but that didn't cause the problem, whatever poisoned the stomach lining created the ulcer.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat do you do? How do you get rid of the flatulence, the indigestion or whatever? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThat's what I mean, my detoxification book is going to get into foods that are fermented, they can start breaking these things down,\r\nYeah. That's what my book is going to go into hopefully without killing anybody. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nRaw sauerkraut?\r\n [Aajonus]\r\nAgain, I'm not going to give any specifics on any of that until I finish all my work and research, because for some people, it's sauerkraut, particular person a particular amount. So, you don't want to dive into this unless you know what you're doing.\r\nUm, you get one question first and then we get around. Yeah.\r\n \n \n \nHigh Fish Neurological Detox \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nWhen I experimented with high fish in stages, eating too much at one time, it can cause a heavy neurological detoxification. It is rare, but it could happen, and it happened to me. It caused a meningitis. It crippled me for about five days, but I'm not your average guy, I'm sickly. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWas it bacterial or viral?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nBacterial. Let me repeat it. Bacteria in high meat is for digesting meat.\r\nIt's not for detoxifying the system.\r\n \n \n \nHoney Breaks Down Protein and Per Day \n \n[Attendee]\r\nAnd put it on there and it almost liquifies it. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nDissolves it. That's why I say, if you're going to eat honey, you need a certain amount of protein in a day. Like in the recipe book, because people were eating too much honey and not eating the meat and they were getting protein deficient.\r\nSo, that's why I say you could have six tablespoons of honey a day. If you're eating a pound of meat, if you're not eating a pound of meat, you have to reduce it proportionally the amount of honey that you consume. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nYou can't just have a tablespoon of honey in the morning?\r\n⁠[Aajonus]\r\nIt's not a good idea. It's always good to have it with food, not by itself.\r\nNo, you don't have to have that much, honey. It's up to you. It's up to your digestion. If you're digesting fine, you don't need a lot of honey, but if everything's very slow digesting, you should be having honey throughout the day. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nIs that all the honey does? Help digestion, does it have any other benefits. \r\n⁠[Aajonus]\r\nThat's just about it, digestion.\r\nThat's why the bears love it. The bears can digest so much food, so quickly. They can gain a tremendous amount of weight. And if they're not gaining the weight, you can better believe they're going to go into a hive, they will invade a hive. If a bear is having trouble gaining weight, he knows he's not going to make it through hibernation.\r\nSo, he will go in and suffer all the stings in the eyes he can take to eat that honey, so he can digest all the foods.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nBecause he hibernates, that's why another animal wouldn't necessarily do that. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nBut you can't just have a lick of the honey with some lemon juice. \r\n⁠[Aajonus]\r\nIt's not a good idea to have stuff like that. Damaging the teeth and the system. If you're gonna dilute it, dilute it in some water. Yeah. You know the lemonade, the lemon, the honey, the water and the cream together. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nOh, the water on the mineral water. Yeah. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWith honey, you are consuming a lot of raw honey. You should always consume a little more raw protein right?\r\n⁠[Aajonus]\r\nExactly, that's what I'm saying.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nWhat's honey made of?\r\n⁠[Aajonus]\r\nHoney is nectar, nectar from a flower, pussy juice.\r\n \n \n \nHoney Per Day Aajonus \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nI eat my six tablespoons a day, if I eat a pound of meat. If I eat more than a pound of meat, I can eat up to proportionally, whatever I could eat up to a cup a day if I have three pounds of meat a day, by the way.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nBy the way Aajonus, I ordered two [unclear size] of raw Tupelo\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nOh yeah, it's hard to get unheated though. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nTotally unheated, raw.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nTupelo is so thick.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nYeah, I Understand. This 90 year old man has been doing it for a long time and it's totally raw.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nTupelo is highest because there's a particular nutrient in the Tupelo flower, in the nectar that even allows the bees to produce more insulin. So, it is even easier for diabetics to eat, it's a slower metabolized.\r\nIt's slower and metabolized.\r\n[Kathy]\r\n So, if you're eating meat, have a tablespoon of honey every time?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\n⁠ I do definitely. I always have honey with my meat.\r\n \n \n \nHoney With Butter Doesn't Count To Honey Limit \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nThat's if you're having the honey and butter mixture after an egg\r\n[Attendee]\r\nThe moisturizing formula is not enough honey, that's all I had?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThe honey and the butter doesn't count. It doesn't count. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nIt doesn't count your honey and your meat?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, because it's mixed in with the butter.\r\nThe formula it's already attached to that medium.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nSo, you need an additional tablespoon with each meat meal?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nCorrect.\r\n \n \n \nHot Bath Ingredients \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nUh, usually I suggest \r\n-two to three cups of milk per bath\r\n-two tablespoons of sun dried sea salt\r\n-two to four tablespoons of raw, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. \r\nThose will help magnetize the poisons in your connective tissue and in your lymph, out through your skin.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nWhy is that 2-4?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt depends on how toxic your water is.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nSo, generally in LA it should be more toxic?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nif you're in the valley, it's less toxic than LA note. Milk, salt and vinegar, 2-4 tablespoons.\r\n \n \n \nHow Long After Meat To Eat Honey \n \n As soon as I finished with the meat, I can have the honey. I may wait, but I usually have it immediately. \n \n \nHow Long To Regenerate Body Parts \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo. And it's from when I started welting up, the toxins started moving out through my skin, a little bit too much. Sugar stays in your body three years at four, I said, it takes 40 years to clean out every cell in your body. Five times, it takes five times. According to Pottengers and Howells work. Takes five generations to clean the body out.\r\nYour blood takes 40 days. \r\nThe skintakes two and a half years. \r\nTestes take two and a half years.\r\nThe bones take seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell. \r\nYou have to do that five times. Every cell in your body has to be replaced at least five times to get to the point where you're completely whole, whole, and natural and healthy.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nYou mean you're not replacing them with good cells yet?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou take somebody who's not well, and when they reproduce, their offspring will not be so healthy. They'll have toxins built into it.\r\nRight. So, it takes 40 years for humans to go through that cycle, 40 years. In Howell and Pottenger's work, what they did was, as soon as the cat or rat reproduced, and the next offering was going, they would kill that animal and then perform autopsies and do tests on it to see the changes.\r\nAnd it took five generations. Well, we don't have to wait five generations of our offspring. We have to wait five generations and cellular transition. It's about 40 years. And that's if you're 100%, if you're not 100%, it could take a lifetime, you know, 50, 60, 80 years, all depends. And that all depends upon how healthy you want to be.\r\nI'm one of those who never wants to have another day of my own purposeful lack of energy and illness. I just don't want to have that. I want to see how healthy I can get and I'm only 21 years into my 40 years. So, I'm only halfway and I'm already satisfied. Even after I got my butt kicked, I still made it I'm here.\r\n \n \n \nHow Much Meat Can A Child Eat (x) \n \n \n \n \nHow To Get Rid Of Heavy Metals \n \nWell, there are different things I recommend.\r\n-Coconut cream\r\n-Cilantro\r\n-Dark Berries\r\n \n \n \nIonizers Leave Room \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, but just make sure they're not on while you're in the room. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nIs there any other particular equipment you might like?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYour Alpine equipment is pretty good.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nHow about a fan?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nMake sure it's three feet from you because the EMF field.\r\nJust make sure you're not in the room when they're on. Because they will change the atomic structure of the air and it's not conducive to health. It burns nerve tissue.\r\n \n \n \nLA Water \n \nThere's no way, unless you're, going to put those ingredients in water, then your body can't reabsorb it, but not like, even if you don't have those things in it, you're not likely to reabsorb what you've exhibited, but you're likely to absorb the chemicals are in the water. \r\nIf I get into LA city water, without those ingredients, I cannot stay in there longer than 7 minutes and I got to get out of there like I'd had 10 cups of coffee and I mean, I am buzzing, my heart's going 90 miles an hour and I'm just shaking. So, I can't do that. Here I've got my own well, so I don't' have all that problem. \r\n \n \n \nLymph System - Lymph massage \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nTo get that stuff liquid again. So, you can get it moving out of the lymph system. Because the lymph system is responsible for cleaning the body. And if the lymph system isn't moving, our arteries, heart congestion is going to keep collecting.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWould lymph massage help?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, lymph massage is the worst thing you can do. Lymph massage is a deep tissue massage. They go down, crack your veins in your circulatory system, your nerves and your lymph system. Rolfing is the worst, but any kind of deep tissue massage that isn't gradual. If they're going to go deep, they have to start lightly and move in slowly.\r\nSo, they're not ripping and breaking things. I suggest that you do just the tickle therapy. If you take your hand and you go over your hair, you'll get a tingling, do it to each other. So over here, hair, on your arm said, hope tingled goes through your entire body. What more stimulation could you want that? When I have a massage, that's what I have them do.\r\nI have him do my entire body tickle therapy. You barely touch my skin. You just go over like that entire body. And it generates everything. The therapist when they're finished with me, they're more red than I am because they're getting all this energy from me as well.\r\n \n \n \nMake up For Sleep By Sleeping More \n \nShe asked if you haven't been getting enough sleep. Can you make it up by sleeping more? Yes, you can, just remember that 90% of cellular division happens in the sleep state. So healing, 90% of the healing happens in the sleep.\r\nAfter I got my but kicked on this, I was sleeping 10, 12 hours a day. It was me, you know, I'm usually four and a half hours a day, person, five hours a day, maximum sleeping. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nDid you get up at a time and eat food?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nOh yes. I never slept more than three hours at a time. Four hours. Always like, of course I don't have to set an alarm.\r\nI got my own internal alarm.\r\n \n \n \nMilk Alone High In Sugar \n \n[Kathy]\r\nOr you can just have plain milk, right? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar. Milk by itself isn't good at that hour It's high in sugar.\r\n[Lewis]\r\nWhat about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, but that's at night. That's not when you're waking up after 5 hours.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nHe said 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep and when you get up and have another 4 ounces, that's colostrum, is that like milk?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nColostrum is a little different  than milk. It's very different from milk.\r\nIf you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night you can have a glass of colostrum. Higher in fat and hormones, less sugar.\r\n \n \n \nMilkshake Recipe \n \n[Kathy]\r\nHow many eggs do you have to make? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt all depends on me. You know, I got the recipe in the recipe book. \r\n-1 to 3 eggs\r\n- 2 to 3 ounces of cream\r\n- 3 to 5 ounces of milk\r\nDepends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.\r\n \n \n \nMonsanto Trying To Destroy Animals \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nE.coli 157 is a fiction.\r\nMonsanto's trying to destroy all the animals in the world, so that any animal that you will get, they will have genetically engineered and patented.\r\nThat way, if ever you have an animal that you raised, you have to pay them royalties. That is the whole idea.\r\n \n \n \nMother Not Producing Milk \n \n[Attendee]\r\nThe lady who showed us to have her baby in a hospital. And the doctor decided very quickly and with labor, she now has the baby and wants to nurse the baby. She is not producing enough. Now they're having a formula, any suggestions?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nLots of milk and eggs, milk, raw milk, a little bit of honey, a lot of cream. Oh yeah. This formula is very toxic. Mostly made with soy.\r\nYeah, it works. If the mother is also getting enough other protein from eggs or meat, otherwise it doesn't work.\r\nI mean it will help them build porosity, but it doesn't help them build a good fat.\r\nShe asked how many eggs a day I eat,  anywhere from four to 20.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nYou were talking about the baby formula, I wasn't breast fed. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nSo, that's the problem. I wasn't breast fed either, I'm a mess!\r\n[Attendees]\r\n*Laughs*\r\n[Attendee]\r\nAnd I was told by my doctor that I was a very fat baby.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nCongratulations, a wonderful thing. A fat baby is a very protected baby, a skinny baby is one where the brain will be damage by any toxins that enter the body.\r\nI like fat babies, I like fat people.\r\n \n \n \nMucus Discharges Poisons \n \nDepends on what's causing it. I mean if it's heavy metals coming out through your mucous membranes, you're not going to stop it. All you can do is just produce enough mucus to keep it from being problem. And that means eating lots of eggs with dairy to create enough mucus to protect your mucous membrane. But I can see by the whites of your eyes, that you have a lot of toxicity in your bone marrow, that means you have a lot of heavy metals in your bone marrow, and that's going to create a problem in any of these bones right here, you're going to detox out of your sinuses. So, you're going to have an allergy problem all your life, until all that's relieved. So, the only thing you can do is make sure that you produce enough mucus to protect those mucus membrane and to discharge the poisons. \n \n \nNeed To Gain Weight - Over Acidity \n \n[Attendee]\r\nI have this acid reflux that causes this cough continually after I eat, when I lay down at night. My teeth, my gums are bleeding continually.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou're way too thin. You don't have any fat to bind with anything. So, all these acids are getting into your blood, into your lymph and to your neurological system. They're burning your system.\r\nYou have to get fat in a condition like that.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nI'm eating lots, I've been on it 16 months.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNot enough. I mean, you should be 30 pounds heavier with that kind of condition.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nI put on 60-70 pounds. I took off 10 of that already. I mean, I didn't try. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition, like that, it permeates their system, unless there is that excessive fat in the blood, lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be saved. You're always going to have symptoms.\r\n \n \n \nNervous System Detoxes At Night \n \n \n \n \nNo Fruit Afte 6 In Afternoon \n \n[2004]\r\nI tell people to eat their fruit in the afternoon and not after six, seven o'clock. Cause it could disturb the whole system after.\r\n \n \n \nNo Green Juices After 6PM \n \n \n \n \nNo Honey After High Meat \n \n[2004]\r\n[Kathy]\r\nEven after high meat, you can have the honey with your mate 20 minutes later. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf I'm having high meat, I wait 15 minutes before I eat my regular meat meal. I have my high meat, wait 15 minutes to have my regular meat meal and then wait until I finish the meat meal before I have my honey.\r\n \n \n \nNo Milk&Honey&Butter With High Meat \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThat's why I say, you don't have a honey with high meat. \r\nYou don't have milk with high meat either, the lactic acid in the milk will destroy the bacteria.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nCan you drink it down with water?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI don't drink it down with anything, but you can with water if you're going to do anything use water. I just chew it and down it.\r\nYeah, then I'll rinse my mouth out if I don't like the taste, but I like the taste. \r\nI like it. It's not a problem, but never take butter with high meat\r\n \n \n \nNo Vegetable Juice For Children \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nUh, because children have a lot of HGA, which is human growth hormone. You know, when we reached 21, 25, we stop producing it. If we don't eat raw meat, we're never going to manufacture it again. We eat raw meat than we will, and we will still continue to have growth hormones. But children, even if they don't eat meat, they have growth hormones, 99% of them.\r\nWhat that causes is an alkaline condition in there blood. So, if they drink the vegetable juice, they become too over alkaline, then they become repulsed to meat and even to dairy, and then they won't eat those foods and then they get cranky. They start going for sugars and then it's unruly and unmanageable. And then it's when you don't want to have children *laughs*.\r\nSo, you don't want them to have vegetable juice, but maybe one day a week. And then you can usually tell they get a little red around the mouth and they're getting a little acidic, a little red around the eyes, red around the ears, they're getting over acid, but it only takes one cup and their back, even a half a cup for a child that size.\r\nSo, you need to use much parsley and children's juice should be only maybe 5% parsley and 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.\r\nThe parsley causes them to get really alkaline, overly alkaline in their intestines and blood. That's the most alkalinizing besides concrete. So, it has to be minimized. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nYou say they tend to lose their appetite when they become over alkaline?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYes , when your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline, you lose appetite for meat. You just start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nIf you had the juice and you don't have an appetite after the juice, it could that you are over alkaline?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nToo much for you. Then you shouldn't be drinking that much juice, or you should skip that particular juice at that time of day. \r\n \n \n \nOver Alkalinity - No Craving For Meat \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nOver alkaline, yes. When your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline you lose your appetite for meat. You start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nSo, if you have the juice and don't have any appetite after the juice it could be that your are becoming over alkaline?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nToo much for you, you shouldn't be drinking that much juice or you should skip that particular juice at the time of day.\r\n \n \n \nOveracidity & Slant Bed Upwards \n \n[2004]\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition like that, it permeates their system, unless there's that excessive fat in the blood lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be safe. You're always going to have symptoms.\r\nAnd if you sleep, you better sleep at a slant. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI tried that. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nWell, it keeps the lungs from collapsing, if you're lying straight the acids seep into the lungs. The lungs can collapse and be hard to breathe properly. When you've got it at a slant, you don't have the gravitational weight as a hindrance to breathing.\r\nYou're elevated like this, feet are this way,  the legs are this way and the bodies at an angle. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nI tried that didn't do any good, lifted the head in my bed. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nBut you had your feet down this way. If you lifted the whole bed than the whole beds at this angle\r\n[Attendee]\r\nNo, I lifted just the head of the bed.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nHow can you lift just the head? If you're lifting the head of the bed, the whole bed is gonna crank. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nThere were bricks underneath it.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nHere's the bed, you put bricks under here, the whole beds gonna slant upward. What you have to do is you have to get the bed like a hospital bed, this level where you're from the waist up at a high angle what you can do is get one of those rectangular shaped pillows or put on your body or use three pillows to layer it.\r\nSo, you're at that angle. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nAnd what about the gums and stuff?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI say you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system going out the teeth. So, keep honey and butter in your mouth. You absorb those acids or cream to keep a little bit of cream in your mouth. Honey & butter mixture. It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth acid.\r\nWhat acid fruit are you talking about tomato? Grapefruit is fine. It all depends upon the individual. I tell people to their their fruit in the afternoon and not after 6-7 o'clock because it could interrupt the whole system.\r\n \n \n \nParasites, Tapeworms \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nA tapeworm lives in the intestines on high carbs. So, as long as you're discarding high-carbohydrate waste into your intestine. Those are going to be your friends. The tapeworm only lives in a third world environment where there's only grains. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nSomebody said that when they got the monkfish livers that they found worms in it. They would find worms in the monkfish or red snapper.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThose are not tapeworms, we're talking about a tapeworm.\r\n[Attendee]\r\n But my one was like, it was like a round worm..\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nPinworm, that lives on the intestinal walls.\r\nIt lives in the intestinal walls like it does in the tripe of the chicken and what they are eating is toxic protein.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhy does my one come out? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt probably got too toxic. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nMaybe because of the raw diet?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo. It's like I say, lives on your intestinal walls. It doesn't have anything to do with what you're eating. Tapeworm lives on what you're eating, pinworm lives on your intestinal walls because of the toxicity.\r\nYou need to have them. If you don't have the pinworm, your intestines could go into cancer.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nSo, there's no danger from them going to organs and things like that?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf you ate just cooked carbohydrates your entire life, possible. Infiltrates the tissue, or if you got poisoned by something that would completely destroy the integrity of cellular divisions it could. But that would take a mass poisoning right there. Say a fish gets into an area with high mercury contamination or high radioactivity...\r\n \n \n \nParsely Too Alkaline For Children \n \nSo, you don't need to use much parsley in children's juice. Should be only maybe 5% parsley and, you know, 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.\r\nThe parsley causes them to get really alkaline. Overly alkaline in the intestine and blood, that's the most alkalizing thing beside concrete, so it has to be minimized.\r\n \n \n \nPasteurized Milk  & Osteoporosis \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nYou have to understand that pasteurized milk causes a lot of osteoporosis and a lot of hardening of the bone. A lot of people get broken bones from eating pasteurized dairy because of the minerals that are cauterized. So concentrated in minerals that it collects in the system. When I had the fermented milk, it started clearing out of my tissues.\r\nA lot of those cauterized minerals.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat would you use to detox old grains and breads?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou just take those grains. If you were eating rye bread, then you use rye. And you let them soak in a lot of water for about three days till they start fermenting and getting mold on them. Then you eat just a little bit of it, but you don't do a lot unless you want to go through a heavy detoxification. So I don't know how much I'm scarred.\r\nI still have, you know, the sore, you see the spots. You know, the little sore from where the hives came out and blistered my skin, see the dark spots. Uh, I've got them all over here and some on my chest.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nLike black spots?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, little dark spots. See them.\r\n \n \n \nPeppermint Oil For Termites \n \n[2004] \r\n[Attendee] \r\nFumigating sounds bad, probably is bad. How do I get rid of these guys without having them destroy... \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nAll you have to do is get some mint juice. Get some mint, like I grew up peppermint all around here, juice that and just start spraying it all around and it will soak into the wood and they cannot eat it now. \r\n[Attendee] \r\nAre they going to go somewhere else now er? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nThey'll go somewhere. Oh, kill them.  \r\n[Attendee] \r\nThose are in there under the home because all I have remnants of is our waste, they built pinholes and they push the waste out. Inject down those holes or? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nYeah, get some mint juice and just start pouring it all around. \r\n[Attendee #2] \r\nDoes actually growing the plant help? \r\n⁠[Aajonus] \r\nYeah, it does help. It will also keep ants away; ants will not burrow into ground where mint is growing. \r\n[Attendee #2] \r\nHow long does it last? \r\n⁠[Aajonus] \r\nIf it soaks into the wood, it's forever. Especially if it has worm holes already in it.  \r\n[Attendee] \r\nBoric acid powders? \r\n⁠[Aajonus] \r\nWell, boric acid powders and if you breathe it, it can cause deteriorations of your respiratory system, \r\nYeah, but also it gases though, say if it rains and moisture gets into the framework, it gases, and you have to deal with those vapors. \r\nThese things were known naturally ages ago, they had fields of mint and they would just grind it into a liquid and just start dumping, treating the wood that way before it even got into a house.  \r\n[Attendee #3] \r\nOh, so they would build houses with mint treated wood? \r\n⁠[Aajonus] \r\nOh yeah. Egyptians were heavy with that when they didn't use rock, they preferred rock. But when they used wood, they were always mint treating.  \r\n[Attendee #4] \r\nUsing baking soda as a deodorant? \r\n⁠[Aajonus] \r\nNo, no, terrible! Diluted lemon juice is the best thing for that. \r\n \n \n \nPlaces With Good Air Quality \n \n[Attendee]\r\nIs there a way to kind of more on a localized basis to monitor air quality. In other words, I'm kind of looking for another place to live, but I want to pick some place where the air is better. You know what I mean? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nCan't get better than this area and the further you go into the city, the more toxic you get. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat about like Altadena, higher up? Are they better or not? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nTerrible! There's a whole toxic layer that sits up there, right up on the mountain, halfway up the mountain. And that layer is probably 1500 feet thick.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWow, cause I was at the impression-\r\n[Aajonus]\r\n if you ever go up in a small plane and you look at the layers, you'll see. \r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nBest area you said?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nAnywhere along the beach.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nAre there any like parts or anything, where do they actually do give you like a more specific report on the air? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThey won't do that. Everybody would be discouraged.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nYeah. Then how do you know? Just because your smell of the-\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nI used to do some tests.\r\nI took flight lessons. I saw the layers. \r\n \n \n \nPoisons Collect In Fat & Organs \n \n[Lewis]\r\nOne time I thought I heard you say that poisons and hormones collect primarily in the organs of the animals-\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nCorrect, in the fat, and the organs. \r\n[Lewis]\r\nOkay. So, uh, just how bad is the muscle. \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt's not bad, most of the poisons go to the fat and the glands. That's why I won't eat glands from an animal, unless it's an organic animal.\r\n \n \n \nPurpose Of High Meat - Digest Meat \n \n[Kathy]\r\nUh, when you're making high fish, what will the high fish do for you? What will it help?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nOkay. Anytime you are making high meat, the whole purpose is for bacteria to break down the meat. Normally in our digestive tracts we have a lot of bacteria that breaks down meat.\r\nNot only hydrochloric acid, but bacteria, salmonella, E.coli. E.coli  is the last final digestion of meat. And then E.coli is the most important bacteria there is. It helps you synthesize B-vitamins and amino acids. It takes that protein and breaks it down into the finest form. It's a backup for your immune system.\r\nWhen you take meat and you fill it full of bacteria, whether you're coating it with E.coli the E.coli breeds on it, what you are doing is introducing bacteria into your body that will help you digest meat, period. That's what it's for. If you want to go into detoxification, you have to ferment that meat severely.\r\nYou have to let it go into a liquid where all the protein is already predigested by the bacteria and it's high in alcohol. That's a bacteria detoxification and that is an extremely hard point to get to. You have to let your meat sit for 6, 7, 8, 10 months before we will come become completely liquid like that. Bacteria in high meat is to help you to just meat, period. That is what it's for.\r\n \n \n \nRaw Honey & Babies \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nThat's all, cause they don't know any better.\r\n⁠When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it produces an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carb into enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly protein. So, it has the protein for digesting protein.\r\nIt's like a solvent that helps break down cellular structures of meat and eggs. Anything that's high in protein. Once you heat it above 93 degrees, that is neutralized or destroyed, the hotter it gets the more destroyed. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat degrees?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\n93 degrees.\r\nSee the bees fan the hive and keep it at 92.8. If the top of the hive goes above 92.8 for very long, for an hour and a half, they will abandon it. They will go to a lower area and they will never eat that honey, unless they're starving. \r\n[James]\r\nI was real skeptical, I deal with Honey Pacifica and Aajonus, I went to the hive desert with him, I stuck my hand in the hive. It was 109 degrees out, but the hive was 75.\r\nAnd many times we've watched the bees not to be able to keep the hive below 93 degrees, they're gone. So this is exactly right.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nSo, what happens is if the baby has a concentrated sugar without the insulin-\r\nSee when the bees get back to the hive they vomit.\r\nSo, honey is nectar predigested vomit. That's what honey is. Once it's heated,  that insulin substance is neutralized. So, when it gets into the baby's system, it's too much sugar. It gets into the blood and nervous system and it can cause anaphylaxis just like a drug. And let me tell you most honeys are treated.\r\nThey are filtered with a filter that has high chemical reactions in it. They're also subjected to cleansers. And then if the baby gets that poison, you go into an anaphylaxis shock. \r\nUnheated honey never has caused a problem and I had babies a month old.\r\n[James]\r\nOkay. The next thing to know is that there is no law. There is no legal description of what the word raw means, That includes cheese, honey, oil, cold pressed, and so if you go to a honey or a beekeeper.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nThey'll tell you it's raw because they believe it's raw.\r\n[James]\r\nThen when you go and check out their operation, it's heated to 120 degrees in the jar. They still don't believe that is heating. They believe it's warming.\r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nCold pressed?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nCold spun. \r\n[Attendee #2]\r\nIs it okay to mix raw honey in a meat dish?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n[James]\r\nSometimes I got piece of tough meat or tough fat and I'll put a piece of honey on it and it almost dissolves it.\r\n \n \n \nSauna Too Hot \n \n[Aajonus] \r\nI like the idea of heat, but saunas I do not like, they're too hot. By the time they get through the third layer of skin, they damage the enzyme content in the skin and the vitamin content, and then start affecting the connective tissue. They also burn the mucous membrane.  \r\nSteam is the same thing; it can even be worse because that gets into the lungs. Because in the sauna you can clear the air by the time it gets past the bronchial, but with steam it will actually get into the lungs and damage the lung walls. So, hot baths, hot water bottles. That is what you should use to help yourself perspire to get rid of the poisons. \r\n[Attendee] \r\nWhat about setting the sauna at low temperatures? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nWell, it depends how long you stay in there. Again, it's dry. You're going to create cracking on your skin. When you get into a bath where you have moisture in there and you have milk in the water, you have some vinegar and you have some sea salt, it's going to help you attract with a magnetic force of all those substances to help pull those toxins out of your skin.  \r\nSo, your skin isn't going to have to work as hard. If you're in a sauna or a steam room, your skin gets damaged. \r\n \n \n \nSoy Fed Chicken - Less Better \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nWell, no. Rosie is a terrible chicken. Rocky Junior.\r\nRosie feeds theirs 75% to 80% soy. Soy has to be cooked and processed. Raw soy will kill a human and will kill birds. So, they have to treat the soy before they feed it. So, it doesn't matter that the soybean was raised organically. Once it's treated with a solvent. It is a chemical. It is no longer organic.\r\nSo, it is a lie, it's misrepresented. It's miss advertising. Rosie organic is not organic.\r\nRocky Junior, the[Kathyy feed theirs 75-80% raw corn. The rest of it is soy, but I can't get them to stop feeding them soy.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nThey're feeding them a certain amount of soy?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nSoy, but it's a small amount compared to Rosie or any other chickens. Sheldon does the same thing. \r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat about James' chicken, is that alright?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nJames gets Rocky.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhy do they feed them soy?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nSoy's an easy protein, fatten them up, build the muscle. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nIt's not gonna bother you if you get that 20% in you?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\n Your body can handle it. If it's eating enough fat.\r\n \n \n \nStye - Use Lemon \n \n \n \n \nSwordfish Aajonus Fav Fish \n \n[Attendee]\r\nSwordfish is okay?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, it's still my favorite.\r\n \n \n \nThird Worl Countries Parasites From Carbs \n \n[Aajonus] \r\nAnd there are some people who are in third world countries that live completely on cooked starches, and they don't get meat. So, what happens is they get parasites, and they have to help them eat that sugar decay, so it doesn't dissolve their whole body. Some people die of malnutrition. They're not dying of the parasite. \r\nThey're dying of malnutrition and the breakdown that the advanced glycation end products and acrylamides are causing in their body. But again, it's a food contamination, it's not the parasite or the bacteria causing the problem. \r\nFlies do the same thing; flies secrete a fluid that dissolves matter. That's part of their digestion, it happens in the mouth, frogs do the same thing. \r\n[Kathy] \r\nIf you eat something from a fly, it lands on the food, it may lay an egg- you may have an egg or something. \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nEven if it puts that fluid down, it's not going to hurt you. You're not eating enough. \r\nIt's not bacteria, we have 23,000 varieties of bacteria in our mouth. The human being is the most toxic and you're looking at bacteria. The most toxic salivary juices in the world. 2,300 various bacteria in the human mouth. How many people have you killed that you bit? \r\nIt's all bullshit. This whole bacteria thing is bullshit. The main enzyme we have is the Tylen enzyme and that breaks down sugar. \r\n[Kathy] \r\nIt's the same thing if a dog bites you, you're not gonna get rabies? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nNot likely. \r\n \n \n \nToo Much Milk Causes Mineral Buildup \n \n[Attendee]\r\nUm, I have been doing a lot of strength and health. And recently I met a dance teacher and I spent four days doing all these dances I've never done before. And my knees just became swollen, what causes that?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt's because you never got married.\r\n[Attendees]\r\n*Laughs*\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, what that usually is is toxic fats leaving your knees.\r\n[Attendees]\r\nSo, I just overstimulated like a detox from all the dancing because I wasn't used to that kind of hopping.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nWell, you also have to understand you were a big milk drinker. You didn't eat a lot of meat for the first three years on the diet. You mainly ate milk and didn't eat much meat and much butter. You were a milk drinker.\r\nMilk is highly concentrated in minerals, low in fat, not high enough in fat for the toxic as we are. So, you just kept collecting a lot of minerals with poisons. And when it comes out to the joints, it will cause tremendous swelling.\r\n \n \n \nToo Much Vege Juice Lose Appeteite For Meat \n \nIf an adult drinks a lot of green juice and they lose their appetite for meat, they're drinking too much juice. Green vegetable juice. \n \n \nVegetable Oils Are Crystals \n \n[2004]\r\nYou take a raw vegetable oil and mix it with dirt and in a year it will be rock. You take animal fat and mix it with dirt, it'll mold and become earth. And it does that in the human body, hardens in the system. Amber is a rock from resin from a tree. Almost all your crystals are vegetable oils, vegetable fats.\r\nThey don't break down in the system easily and once they've been cooking in the body, they never turn liquid until it reaches 102 degrees. So, you have to have lots of hot baths from a 102 to 105 degrees, and you have to stay in there for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.\r\n \n \n \nViruses Are Solvents \n \n[2004] \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nJust remember, virus are not alive. This whole contagious shit about mosquitoes carrying virus, and all kinds of things. That's like you taking soap with you and saying that it's contagious. Soap is not contagious. It does not self-replicate, I don't care how many homes have tide in it. You cannot prove that it self-replicates.  \r\nThe body makes solvent to dissolve compounds in your body. If you were so toxic that your body can't use a bacteria or a parasite or other live organisms to break that cell down that became tissue, your body has to make a soap, a solvent. That's what viruses are. \r\nYou look at any book, ask any good microbiologists, they'll tell you virus are protein bodies. They're not alive. They can't reproduce, but yet they self-replicate. Hello. They are soap, they are solvent. They even admit when you look in any biology book, you cannot find a virus outside of a live cell environment. Why? Because the cells are the producing the virus. \r\nThey don't self-replicate. A cell has to manufacture the soap. We manufacture soap all the time. We manufacture alcohol all the time. We'll take a carbohydrate and ferment it in our intestines, take the alcohol we'll make a solvent out of it. They'll dissolve the toxicity in the system. That's what a virus is. It's a refined, specific, highly densified protein body, solvent, that'll just dissolve matter. \r\nIt's not the nicest way to get rid of the toxins. The bacteria and parasites can consume decaying tissue and reduce it to a micro amount of what it was. It's like we can do 13 pounds of food in a day and pass a half a pound turd the next day. Well, if a parasite gets ahold of some tissue, it can reduce it to a hundredth of a percent of what it was and reduce that toxicity into a very small amount. So, it isn't so difficult to get rid of.  \r\nWhen the body uses a solvent, what happens when we use a solvent? we dilute it with water and then we contaminate everything else. And we have this whole bucket of contaminated water. It's the same thing happens in the human body. \r\nWe have virus, bacteria, and parasites to help us, detoxification is mitigated. When our body uses solvents, it's distributed a lot more toxic. That's why doctors are more afraid of viral meningitis than a bacterial meningitis, because the fluids become immense when we're scraping down all that toxic matter from the nervous system and mostly it's heavy metals, free radicals that go in and do tremendous damage to other areas of the body, which you don't normally destroy when parasites and bacteria are active.  \r\n[Attendee] \r\nTalking parasite, are you talking a one cell parasite? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nI'm talking about any parasite.  \r\n[Attendee] \r\nSome of them can kill you? \r\n[Aajonus] \r\nNo, they can't. You die from the treatment of amoebic dysentery, you take antibiotics, it destroys your ability to digest, and you die. \r\n \n \n \nWhat To Drink At Night \n \n[Aajonus]\r\nDrinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice. You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, you go to sleep.\r\n[Attendee]\r\nWhat about in the middle of the night, take a milkshake too?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf you wake, yeah. If you don't wake, set an alarm after 5 hours. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nOr can just have plain milk, right? \r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar. Milk by itself isn't good at that hour.\r\n[Lewis]\r\nWhat about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night.\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYeah, but that's not when you wake up after 5 hours.  \r\n[Kathy]\r\nYou said you can have 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep, then you get up and haev another 4 ounces. Is that colostrum?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nColostrum is a little different from milk. it's very different from milk. \r\n[Kathy]\r\nSo, colostrum you can have?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIf you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night, you can have a glass of colostrum. Higher in fat and hormone, less in sugar.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nSo then you'll have a four ounces of milkshakes one time and then have the other four ounces?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nYou could do that.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nBut it makes it up to 4 ounces doesn't it? How many eggs should I put it?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nIt all depends, you know I've got the recipe in the recipe book.\r\n[Kathy]\r\nOne egg?\r\n[Aajonus]\r\nNo, you could have 1 to 3 eggs. 2 - 3 ounces of cream, and 3 - 5 ounces of milk, depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.\r\n \n \n \nWhole Foods Feeds Their Cows Bakery Waste \n \nWhole foods is worse. Whole food feeds theirs 15% bakery waste. Stale donuts, and they call it natural. \"All natural\". \n \n \n### (1) 90% Of Alfalfa Is Sprayed \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd now in Santa Fe all I can get is raw goat milk and they feed it grain\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCows, deer; they all eat lots of grain.\n\n They eat grain all the time.\n\n Grain fed animals are fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought organic pastures fed them grass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they feed them some grain?\n\n \r\nWhenever they get milked, they get fed some grain.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, it's okay to give grain to them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n \r\nThey're built to eat that.\n\n They're built to eat high carbs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI just thought my knees swelling might've been from all the sugar from the grains.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, well, it's high in minerals.\n\n All milk is whether it's from a cow or goat, just from a goat there's even less fat than with a cow.\n\n\r\nYeah, but there's not enough fat to disperse and to get it out properly.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow come you went to New Mexico.\n\n \r\nAny reason?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n85% percent of the time, the grain fed to animals is sprayed.\n\n It's toxic grain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe're talking about grain is fine, but you're talking about pesticides and stuff like that.\n\n \r\nThat's something different, but you have to understand that most of the grasses that are fed these animals too.\n\n \r\n'cause they're fed alfalfa during the winter.\n\n You know, bales of alfalfa, 90% of its's sprayed too.\n\n\r\nJust like the grain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven in New Zealand, in New Zealand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Can't Give Himself Parasites \n \nI could never breed them\n\n \r\nYou know, I tried to spike myself with them and I couldn't get him to live.\n\n\r\nAfter the chemotherapy, I was so poisoned that anything that tried to live in my body would die.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Eats Half A Pound Of Butter A Day \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nDepends upon the  individual\n\n \r\nI eat a half a cup a day.\n\n \r\nSo half a pound a day minimum.\n\n\r\nPlus my cream.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Aajonus Likes The Taste Of Grain Fed Beef \n \n \n \n \n### (5) Acid Reflux From Poisons Dumping Into Stomach \n \nThat's usually severe delipidization\n\n \r\n\r\nMeans in your digested track and your sinuses, you may be dumping a lot of cauterized minerals from your days of cooked food.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, they store in your esophagus and in your sinus and your stomach.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWell, when you eat.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNo matter what you eat, the sinuses and the esophagus and the stomach will start dumping some of those into the food.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAcid reflux is that problem to the extreme.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, it'll dump it into whatever food you have.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's why I say you always need to eat fat with whatever food you're going to eat, so that those poisons don't go into the meat and the other nutrients because you won't be able to utilize them.\n\n \r\n\r\nOnce those portions get into there, they neutralize the acidity and the digested juices and destroy bacteria.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, the villa don't work properly anymore, so that food will not be digested.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, if you're eating butter, cream, eggs or something to fat with whatever food you're eating, so that fat will absorb those poisons so that you can utilize your food.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you will not.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou're not likely to to digest and utilize very much of it.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (6) Alzheimers Patients Forget To Drink Water \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUhh, yeah?\n\n I had a talk with this guy.\n\n \r\nHe claims that people with Alzheimer's disease drink very little water and so in order to cure this problem, he put them on a 20 day fast and they drink about a gallon a day of water.\n\n And he claims\r\nAnd he says talking to some of these people some of them haven't had a glass of water in 15 years.\n\n\r\nNow I know you don't like too much water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, in a situation like that, it's a temporary good fix because the water, like I said, is leaching.\n\n \r\nYou know, so they have a mineral buildup, if they a plaquing in their system that's blocking the neurological system, the lymph, or the circulatory system, the bloodstream.\n\n \r\nDrinking a lot of water like that can cause a lot of dissolution of that plaque, those minerals.\n\n \r\nBut also what does it do to the blood in the glandular system and everything else.\n\n \r\nSo, they might be able to get away with doing it once or twice in their life, but not as a regular thing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, he's not doing this all the time.\n\n\r\nYeah, this this is a one time fix.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's a one time fix, but it won't relieve it forever.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, if they don't drink water, it may come back even.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven if they drink while it'll come back.\n\n \r\nBut it is a temporary fix that can be utilized in certain situations.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut the doctors don't have any solution\r\n\n\r\nThey don't have any solution to anything.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Black Plague From Toxins, Coal Factories, Mercury \n \n**[Lewis]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it runs the treatments that is that\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's from the high toxicity in the person and then when they take a drug or medication it weakens their body.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd they usually go in anaphylaxis, which is a shock.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd they die.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut of course the medical professionals isn't going to take blame for that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBecause then you'd sue them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd they'd be blamed for everything that they do cause.\n\n  \r\n\r\nTry to do that with.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if the person has rabies, that they just suffered the symptoms and never got an injection they could survive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut in the old days when they use to treat because you know you have foaming of the mouth because usually that particular bacteria is is familiar to the nervous system is like syphilis, so it can dissolve brain tissue quickly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd if you've been a person who grew up, let's say.\n\n  \r\n\r\nA lot of people who got, you know lung disease, black lung disease were the people who lived in London around the smoking factories.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they got the black plague because they were around this heavy rlead and metal fog everyday breathing it, so lungs were heavily damaged.\n\n So, it wasn't the bacteria that was associated with the detoxification.\n\n There was the actual poison metals that were dissolving their lung tissue.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOf course, technology in those days you know you got silver, chalices and stuff like that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be gorgeous and beautiful, full of mercury.\n\n  \r\n\r\nGot the smelting factories around and everybody thinks it's advanced society, you know, so you don't want to give it up.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou're not going to admit what it does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd the thing about historical stories that.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it didn't have anything to do with it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSmoking factors and also when they were burning the cats, they were putting a lot of toxins in the air.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey were burning everything.\n\n  \r\n\r\nJerusalem had it right.\n\n You know in Jerusalem during Christ time; the garbage collectors were the pigs.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey were sacred.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou could not eat them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou could not kill them; they'd run around the streets and- .\n \n \n \n### (8) Bloodshot Eyes From Sleeping \n \n**[2004],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYes, I noticed I go into sleep about mid evening and that's fine\n\n \r\nI know I'm detoxing and healing.\n\n\r\nAnd afterwards when I  wake up.\n\n \r\nI notice a lot of redness, bloodshot in my eyes.\n\n\r\nWhat is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's usually the brain detoxifying heavy metals out your tear ducts?\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nRight since I've had a history of metal.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Brain Has Most Toxins In The Body \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe toxins ago secrete out the eyes and the ears and the sinuses are all from the brain\n\n \r\nAnd the brain has the most toxic collection of minerals than any other part of the body.\n\n \r\nYour body needs metallic metals and other minerals to transfer light, which is neurotic transmission.\n\n\r\nSo, the brain collects a lot of heavy metals.\n\n \r\nWhen they have to discharge, they discharge out the head, the throat, the gums.\n\n All that heavy plaquing on your teeth.\n\n \r\nThose are cauterized minerals, some cooked foods collected in the brain and they're discharging.\n\n \r\nAnd there may be bacteria in it, they're may not.\n\n\r\nDepending on how many cells are alive in your brain to be able to discharge some bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there a remedy for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIs there a remedy?\n\n Lots of cheese with butter to relieve the constipation?\n\n\r\nEqual amounts of butter.\n\n \r\nYes, it is a cheesecake.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Carpets \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNew carpets if you don't have cotton or wool carpets, you've got toxic plastic in your environments it's like wearing plastic clothes\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnything that isn't cotton, silk, or wool; you are going to breathe plastic particles, lint! \r\n\r\nYou take a synthetic, whether it's some pine needles or whatever.\n\n You take the synthetic material, and you shake it in the light, you'll see all this plastic dust all over the place.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe lint is plastic.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDo you think that your lungs can break that plastic down.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNo way! \r\n\r\nSo, your carpet?\n\n You see that the carpet in my house, the synthetic is covered with either wool or cotton carpet every year.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you can't vacuum it out.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou can't vacuum continually?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou'd have to vacuum 24 hours a day, all day long?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's not a carpet, it's a synthetic rug.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat is a plastic epoxy that gets into your lungs.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's part of the fiber.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou cannot digest that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWe knowingly breathe plastic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs it okay if we use a natural organic wool?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, if it's if it's from wool, period, if it's from an animal your body can break it down?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's used to disassembling animal cells, whether it's hair or what.\n\n Our bodies spent millions of years adapting to that, the plastic no.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nLinen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but it will be a little bit more difficult because they use high heat to solidify it and the fats in vegetable oils harden in the human system?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's harder to breakdown, it isn't as bad as plastic, but it's not as good.\n\n \r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (11) Causes and Remedies For Eye Problems \n \n**[Eric]**\n\r\nEric, actually I had a real question and a quick novelty question that I think\n\n \r\nThe real one is what's your take on the causes and the remedies for the atheroma's that sometimes people develop under their eyes or in various places like that that.\n\n Fat deposits.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust remember that poisons storing the fats.\n\n If your eyes, if your body is using your eyes as a detoxification center, the tear ducts.\n\n \r\nFatty deposits will normally form.\n\n \r\nIf they don't, you're in trouble.\n\n \r\nBecause the eyes will be terribly affected if they are, and you can see people with very bulging eyes.\n\n \r\nAnd then all this sunken around them, they usually end up with a severe eye condition later in life, that's high pressure and like glaucoma, and cause a lot of problems, headaches continually throughout their life, irritability.\n\n \r\nBut anywhere where you have fat collections.\n\n \r\nThat is the body throwing poisons into those areas.\n\n\r\nIf it's around the eyes.\n\n \r\nLike Laurie, when I first met her she had huge bags under her eyes.\n\n\r\nShe also cancer in three parts of her body, she was ultra thin.\n\n \r\nOver the years it's diminished.\n\n \r\nShe doesn't have that bulging.\n\n\r\nAnd her father had it too tremendously.\n\n\r\nNow, usually the toxins that go secrete out the eyes.\n\n \r\nAnd the ears-\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Chlorine and Bromine In A Hot Tub \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about hot tubs\n\n They probably have bromine and chlorine in them?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, my hot tub back there.\n\n \r\n\r\nI just use sand in this filter.\n\n I don't use any chemicals, just sand in the filter \r\n\r\nYep, I use a 200 pound sand filter.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI like my algae.\n\n \r\n\r\nI breed the algae and make sure the algae is full in there.\n\n It's beneficial to the skin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd it helps feed the skin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf the algae is eating the dead cells on the skin, then you don't need salmonella on the skin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSalmonella dries me out too much.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut that's our normal cleanser.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSalmonella eats the dead cells on your skin to break them off and get rid of them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, salmonella is very important to have on the skin.\n\n But if you live in an environment where you can have algae eat those dead cells instead of the salmonella, then your skin doesn't get as dry, or my skin doesn't get as dry.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot right now, it's too hot.\n\n I use it to get cool right now.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAbout 105 degrees.\n\n Unless James gets in it, then it goes to 106-109.\n\n No one can sit in it, but him.\n\n *laughs* .\n \n \n \n### (13) Cholesterol Book \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nGood, you'll be healthier than most people\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI've been reading about that, but I feel absolutely the other way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, just get rid of It, propaganda.\n\n Like I said, get the book, it's called The Cholesterol Myth.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou read that book and you'll be cured.\n\n  \r\n\r\nGet that book and read it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nI didn't hear the question.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nShe said she has high cholesterol levels, and she worries about the high cholesterol levels because when she eats the diet it makes a higher cholesterol.\n\n \r\n\r\nDid you have a 700 cholesterol level.\n\n I might be concerned?\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's a good amount.\n\n I like 350 to 400.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHigh cholesterol's healthy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's right?\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou have to understand on this diet, even if you're not on this diet.\n\n  \r\n\r\nStill healthy to have a high cholesterol.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBecause the fats bind with the poisons.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you are fat deficient in your blood and you have a low fat level, guess where the poisons are going to go.\n\n Into the cells?\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe red and white blood cells, you're going to transfer less oxygen.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou're going to have more problems.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, ahigh cholesterol level is good, it's just that the food industry like to jump on this thing about, well, we can sell now our foods calling them low cholesterol, like cereals and other garbage.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the book called.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe Cholesterol Myth?\n\n It's referenced in my recipe book.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, don't worry about be happy, because remember when you're on this diet, at least 50% of the cholesterols that are in your blood are going to be toxic ones that are on their way out.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (14) Citrus Oil \n \nBut it won't harm him\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, it could harm him, but it would healthfully harm him?\n\n \r\nYeah, but you know, usually in citrus oils, it's one of the most potent solvent oils.\n\n You use it to make turpentine.\n\n  \r\nYou know, so it's a very good solvent.\n\n  \r\nSo, while he's young, he's probably breaking some very toxic oils down from.\n\n  \r\nEspecially if he's eaten some cooked vegetables.\n\n  \r\nWe'll break it down.\n\n  \r\nMostly from citrus peel.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Clothing Detergent Biokleen \n \nNo, I use biokleen from grape seed oil, grapefruit seed oil\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (16) Cockroaches \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I never known\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnybody on this raw diet that had a roach problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nI had a late summer.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAbout roaches, what do you do about roaches.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCause I never had a roach problem before?\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, like I say, I been on this diet and even when I lived in Beverly Hills, they have the worst roach problem in the world they called Palmetto bugs in Beverly Hills.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, let me tell you, I was in a in a building where the roaches, I mean big big roaches with 90 year old woman that had an apartment above me and her place was- I mean 1 drawer I opened.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n there were 1000 roaches in one drawer.\n\n \r\n\r\n1000.\n\n Under her sink there were at least 3000 roaches.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI had none in my apartment and my apartment was right next to her.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, what do you think explains it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe guy is not serial, they're outside of it, so?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey like cooked decaying food.\n\n Cooked decaying food is what they live on.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's what she had all over her house.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCooked, yeah?\n\n \r\n\r\nYep, they love that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey love cereals, they love anything cooked.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI heard if you leave a leaf on the floor, they'll be attracted, they'll smell that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's bullshit, that's bullshit?\n\n They love mold.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nI used to have an apartment, I had roaches and I knew they didn't clean it properly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI pulled the stove out and it was filthy and once I cleaned under that stove, I had no more roaches, but in Hawaii, the roaches were so big you could put saddles on them.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's a really good way if you really have a lot of roaches is you just get empty jars and you put a little bit of oil.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAny kind of oil like here on the inside of the jar only at the top and then you put a little bit of stale beer in the bottom, and they go in after the beer, but then they can't climb out cause of the oil and then they just fill up the jars.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (17) Coconut Cream With Meat Or Fruit \n \nIf I want to, I usually don't have coconut cream with meat\r\nI usually save my coconut cream to have with fruit in the afternoon\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Cod Liver Oil Solvent Extracted \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not raw\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat Jacob Miller has cod liver oil\r\n\n\r\nThere's no cod liver oil that isn't solvent processed.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou know I'm talking about.\n\n \r\nIs that he has a listing of items.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't care, that cod liver oil is just as toxic as any other.\n\n\r\nCold pressed doesn't make any difference with solvent treated.\n\n \r\nThey purify it with a solvent.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Cold Feet Takes 15 Years To Heal \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy feet tend to be cold\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's usually a bone marrow problem.\n\n So, the bone marrow in your feet are probably pretty acid and pretty toxic.\n\n So, that would be a matter of applying hot water bottles at night.\n\n \r\nGet the circulation to change, and that usually takes 10 to 15 years change.\n\n \r\nIt's a long one, it's a long and slow one.\n\n With me with my blood and bone cancer, the feet were the last thing to change and they did it in the last two years.\n\n \r\nThis particular ankle right here, the rest of my body could be completely warm, but this would feel like it came right out of the freezer.\n\n \r\nAnd I would have to wrap it, bundle it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nNow it's better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, now this last two years is the first winter where I didn't have a problem?\n\n \r\nIt's fine, yeah.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCan you wear socks.\n\n You can't wear socks with it?\n\n\r\nYeah, you can wear socks?\n\n Anytime you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'll tell you I bought these sandals 3 months ago and this is the first.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're warming up.\n\n \r\nIt takes a long time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about numbness in your feet.\n\n \r\nIf you move your toes and it feels kinda numb.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDead cells.\n\n Not enough fat to collect the toxicity, so it's gone into the nerves.\n\n \r\nNo cramping can be a mixture of a lot of different things.\n\n\r\nCramping can be dehydration.\n\n \r\nIt can be collection of toxic minerals, attractive substances too much carbohydrate byproducts, acrylamides that collect in the muscles.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Cold Pressed Coconut Oil \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe organic cold pressed coconut\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's no such thing as unheated coconut.\n\n \r\nThey usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, that's bullshit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Cows Dig Up Ground Eat Roots, Etc \n \nBuffalo will pull up a whole field of potatoes if he gets ahold of one\n\n\r\nPut it into a field of potatoes and the cow will dig it up.\n\n \r\nThat's why you put rings on the nose of pigs and cows.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Cream Relievs Urehtra Pain \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe nervous system detoxifies when there's no light and at night time\n\n\r\nIf you're in a climate you know like you're in, let's say, Finland.\n\n \r\nIn the summer, you know it's light all day long you will still detoxify.\n\n \r\nNormally when the sun is the lowest.\n\n \r\nAnd the nervous system detoxifies.\n\n \r\nLike I said, in the nervous system, in the brain.\n\n \r\nThat has the most free radicals, heavy metals.\n\n \r\nWhat happens if the free radicals touch cells, it burns them.\n\n \r\nGets into the blood, gets into the kidneys.\n\n \r\nGets into the bladder, causes irritation through the urethra into the bladder walls.\n\n \r\nYou have to relieve it, you have to get it out quickly.\n\n \r\nOnly way you can help resolve that is to drink a lot of cream before you go to sleep.\n\n \r\nThat will help ease it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been drinking my juice before bed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEliminate the juice and have let's say, like 2-3 ounces of cream with your juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, not that much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOK, then you gotta cut it out because the minerals and the juice are helping you eliminate from the neurological system at night.\n\n \r\nIf you're not sleeping well, it would be better that you didn't detoxify that quickly.\n\n \r\nCream is always good to help.\n\n \r\nBind with those acrid minerals that cause irritation to the tissue.\n\n \r\n2-3 oz Yep, Yep.\n\n \r\nIf I drink a vegetable juice, I urinate 5 minutes later.\n\n With.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n intensity!\r\nSpecially now that I'm so thin.\n\n \r\nWhen I get the weight back on, it won't be as bad.\n\n \r\nWhen you're as thin as me, you can't even move with that kind of mineral toxicity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Detoxing Old Sugar With Sugarcane Juice \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, alright OK we're gonna get started now\n\n  \r\n\r\nNow first I'm gonna tell you the book that I've been working on next is detoxification.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd I get a lot of people from the Internet.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know the Yahoo groups who talk about heavy detoxification and doing heavy detoxification.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, my methods of detoxification are usually to take a food that you've eaten in the years of eating cooked foods.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou ferment it and eat it.\n\n What you are doing is introducing bacteria that is absent in the food that you've eaten cooked.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, you've got no way to recycle it out of the body.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, your body has to make solvents like virus to dissolve that toxicity and remove it gradually, very gradually and slowly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, in the detoxification book, I'm telling people how to gradually detoxify.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd that's why I'm taking those foods, how to ferment them and how to eat them and in what quantities.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, two weeks ago I decided to push the envelope to see how much of the detoxification was too much.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI did it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhile I was in Vietnam three weeks ago, they have sugar cane juice.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou could get it anywhere, almost anywhere in Asia, and of course I was a sugar junkie.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI was diabetic and I would put down a whole box of chocolate covered cherries in one afternoon.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know lots of candy and lots of powdered Donuts.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd I loved all that stuff.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI was a sugar freak.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecame diabetic.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I decided that I was going to detox the sugar that has been in my system.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I fermented the sugar cane juice.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWell, I had diarrhea for about 5 days on and off.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhile I was in Vietnam, during that I got tremendous hives everywhere and I used to get hives all the time so badly that it burned my skin and it'd blister, and scabs would fall off.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd it was mainly around my kidneys, all the places where a diabetic is most effected.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it was all along here, I had huge marks still coming out my ass.\n\n \r\n\r\nI lost mine complete ass, dropped in a week.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI had this beautiful round ass, and it was gone in a week.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut sugar was stored in these tissues.\n\n It's not there! No ass! \r\n\r\nSecond thing to do, I was also a heavy milk drinker, pasteurized milk drinker.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, two weeks ago I decided to drink an intense amount of fermented milk.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat was two weeks fermented, so it smelled like alcohol.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt burned my lungs if I inhaled it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I drank 2 ½ cups of it at one time.\n\n I was on the toilet for three days, 72 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs that raw milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRaw milk?\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd again, it caused that kind of detoxification, but that wasn't my ass, lost my ass.\n\n \r\n\r\nI also lost about 20 pounds in about four days.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I put 10 pounds back on, so I don't look so bad as I did four days ago, but he kicked my butt, so I kind of see the limitation.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, all these people on the Internet who say go for it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHeavy detoxifications, I don't suggest to do.\n\n Not unless you're 50 pounds overweight.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou can afford to lose that much weight.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt was too much for me to lose, I was debilitated.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI could barely move for about two or five days.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know, just diarrhea and the exhaustion and the weight loss.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd getting back up to this weight, I've been eating all day long every day.\n\n  \r\n\r\nFood and food and food and food and cheesecakes galore.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd cheesecakes help absorb that toxicity.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI had less rashes, less hives when I would eat the cheesecake, so I'd make a cheesecake for about 3 days.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd eat pieces all along the day throughout the day.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, that's what I have to say about the detoxification before the book comes out.\n\n Don't push anything too heavily.\n\n You're going to ferment something to detoxify that that's in your body, something you've eaten a lot of in your past life, cooked life.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo more than an ounce or two ounce every time with that particular food.\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't push it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nUnless, you know you've got a lot of weight.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know, then you could probably afford to do it, but still, if you have to work, you're not going to be able to function very well.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you have that kind of a detoxification, OK, any questions about that.\n\n**[Jeff]**\n \r\n\r\nEven if you eat something from your past, is it necessarily pulling out the old stuff?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, what I did was I had some of my feces checked while I was in Vietnam?\n\n \r\n\r\nI got a laboratory to check it and it was a lot of old toxic cauterized sugar in there from that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd here it was metals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I had the milk, it caused a bunch of metals to come out of my system.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd I started forming stones in my urine.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou know, so it caused a heavy mineral detoxification.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (24) Detoxing Through Skin, Dry Skin Etc \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTell us a bit about it because detoxing through the skin\n\n Can it cause symptoms like dry skin, itchy skin, chapped lips and warts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n That's why I like the primal facial body care cream.\n\n If you're going through any kind of a skin detox, any kind of a rash, dry skin period.\n\n Poisons are leaving through your skin.\n\n \r\nIn an intense amount it's drying out the surrounding cells.\n\n There's not enough fat in those cells, so when the toxin moves past it, it draws the fat outt of that cell and that cell will crack and damage and scar.\n\n\r\nSo, with the primal facial body care cream on.\n\n It will be able to be absorbed into the surrounding cells.\n\n So, you don't have as much damage.\n\n I mean, if I hadn't put that on these areas, I would have huge sores and huge scars.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou make it up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you make it up, it's on page 145 of the recipe book?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow long is it good for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've had it up to six months in the refrigerator?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThrow it away after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I've always used it within six months?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Diet For Over Acidic Gums \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd what about the gums and stuff\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGums, you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system, going out the teeth?\n\n So keep honey and butter in your mouth.\n\n You absorb those acids.\n\n \r\nOr cream, keep a little bit of cream in your mouth.\n\n \r\nHoney/butter mixture.\n\n It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Different Meat Sdifferent Bacteria \n \n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThen why are you going into different meats to make high chicken, high beef, all these other things\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause there's a different bacteria for each meat, there are thousands of bacteria, which you want to try to get them all going.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHigh fish will help you digest fish, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, correct?\n\n There's a whole array of bacteria for each meat.\n\n And if you breed those and introduce those to your body, you're going to digest that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Don't Drink Vege Juice At Night \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you say you prefer the green juice before you go to bed\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends upon the individual?\n\n I give guidelines in the book, four juices a day, one before you go to sleep at night.\n\n If you're a person who gets hyperactive from drinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice.\n\n You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, and go to sleep.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIn the middle of the night, take a milkshake.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you wake.\n\n Yeah.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Don't Go Longer Than 5 Hours Without Eating \n \n \n \n \n### (29) Don't Sit In Sun With Dry Skin \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if your skin is dry, you don't want to sit in the sun without the Primal Facial Body Care Cream or coconut cream\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf it's raw coconut oil that you make yourself, it's great?\n\n That's what the natives always used for thousands and thousands of years, just break coconut juice.\n\n They would grate the coconut meat and ring out the fat, apply it and eat it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe organic cold pressed coconut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's no such thing as unheated coconut.\n\n They usually pasteurize or steam the coconut before they cold press it, bullshit, not raw.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) H Pylori \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nH\n\n Pylori is part of the stomach lining, we've had it for billions of years, all animals.\n\n Again, the medical profession is trying to blame everything that's disease on bacteria, but we lived with these bacteria for millions of years without disease.\n\n Why is everybody getting ulcers now.\n\n Ulcers were unheard of before coffee became into existence.\n\n\r\nNow that coffees around, ulcers are normal thing.\n\n And again, if you have an ulcer, you're going to have pylori bacteria in the tissue, but that didn't cause the problem, whatever poisoned the stomach lining created the ulcer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you do.\n\n How do you get rid of the flatulence, the indigestion or whatever?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I mean, my detoxification book is going to get into foods that are fermented, they can start breaking these things down,\r\nYeah?\n\n That's what my book is going to go into hopefully without killing anybody.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nRaw sauerkraut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAgain, I'm not going to give any specifics on any of that until I finish all my work and research, because for some people, it's sauerkraut, particular person a particular amount?\n\n So, you don't want to dive into this unless you know what you're doing.\n\n\r\nUm, you get one question first and then we get around.\n\n Yeah.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) High Fish Neurological Detox \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I experimented with high fish in stages, eating too much at one time, it can cause a heavy neurological detoxification\n\n It is rare, but it could happen, and it happened to me.\n\n It caused a meningitis.\n\n It crippled me for about five days, but I'm not your average guy, I'm sickly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas it bacterial or viral.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBacterial?\n\n Let me repeat it.\n\n Bacteria in high meat is for digesting meat.\n\n\r\nIt's not for detoxifying the system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Honey Breaks Down Protein and Per Day \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd put it on there and it almost liquifies it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDissolves it.\n\n That's why I say, if you're going to eat honey, you need a certain amount of protein in a day.\n\n Like in the recipe book, because people were eating too much honey and not eating the meat and they were getting protein deficient.\n\n\r\nSo, that's why I say you could have six tablespoons of honey a day.\n\n If you're eating a pound of meat, if you're not eating a pound of meat, you have to reduce it proportionally the amount of honey that you consume.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou can't just have a tablespoon of honey in the morning.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not a good idea?\n\n It's always good to have it with food, not by itself.\n\n\r\nNo, you don't have to have that much, honey.\n\n It's up to you.\n\n It's up to your digestion.\n\n If you're digesting fine, you don't need a lot of honey, but if everything's very slow digesting, you should be having honey throughout the day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that all the honey does.\n\n Help digestion, does it have any other benefits?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's just about it, digestion.\n\n\r\nThat's why the bears love it.\n\n The bears can digest so much food, so quickly.\n\n They can gain a tremendous amount of weight.\n\n And if they're not gaining the weight, you can better believe they're going to go into a hive, they will invade a hive.\n\n If a bear is having trouble gaining weight, he knows he's not going to make it through hibernation.\n\n\r\nSo, he will go in and suffer all the stings in the eyes he can take to eat that honey, so he can digest all the foods.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause he hibernates, that's why another animal wouldn't necessarily do that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut you can't just have a lick of the honey with some lemon juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not a good idea to have stuff like that.\n\n Damaging the teeth and the system.\n\n If you're gonna dilute it, dilute it in some water.\n\n Yeah.\n\n You know the lemonade, the lemon, the honey, the water and the cream together.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, the water on the mineral water.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith honey, you are consuming a lot of raw honey.\n\n You should always consume a little more raw protein right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nExactly, that's what I'm saying?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's honey made of.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHoney is nectar, nectar from a flower, pussy juice?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Honey Per Day Aajonus \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI eat my six tablespoons a day, if I eat a pound of meat\n\n If I eat more than a pound of meat, I can eat up to proportionally, whatever I could eat up to a cup a day if I have three pounds of meat a day, by the way.\n\n**[Attendee],[unclear size],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBy the way Aajonus, I ordered two \n of raw Tupelo\r\n\n\r\nOh yeah, it's hard to get unheated though.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTotally unheated, raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTupelo is so thick.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I Understand.\n\n This 90 year old man has been doing it for a long time and it's totally raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTupelo is highest because there's a particular nutrient in the Tupelo flower, in the nectar that even allows the bees to produce more insulin.\n\n So, it is even easier for diabetics to eat, it's a slower metabolized.\n\n\r\nIt's slower and metabolized.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\n So, if you're eating meat, have a tablespoon of honey every time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n⁠ I do definitely?\n\n I always have honey with my meat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Honey With Butter Doesn't Count To Honey Limit \n \n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's if you're having the honey and butter mixture after an egg\r\n\n\r\nThe moisturizing formula is not enough honey, that's all I had\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe honey and the butter doesn't count?\n\n It doesn't count.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt doesn't count your honey and your meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because it's mixed in with the butter?\n\n\r\nThe formula it's already attached to that medium.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, you need an additional tablespoon with each meat meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Hot Bath Ingredients \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUh, usually I suggest \r\n-two to three cups of milk per bath\r\n-two tablespoons of sun dried sea salt\r\n-two to four tablespoons of raw, unpasteurized apple cider vinegar\n\n \r\nThose will help magnetize the poisons in your connective tissue and in your lymph, out through your skin.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhy is that 2-4.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends on how toxic your water is?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, generally in LA it should be more toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nif you're in the valley, it's less toxic than LA note?\n\n Milk, salt and vinegar, 2-4 tablespoons.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) How Long After Meat To Eat Honey \n \n As soon as I finished with the meat, I can have the honey\n\n I may wait, but I usually have it immediately.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) How Long To Regenerate Body Parts \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo\n\n And it's from when I started welting up, the toxins started moving out through my skin, a little bit too much.\n\n Sugar stays in your body three years at four, I said, it takes 40 years to clean out every cell in your body.\n\n Five times, it takes five times.\n\n According to Pottengers and Howells work.\n\n Takes five generations to clean the body out.\n\n\r\nYour blood takes 40 days.\n\n \r\nThe skintakes two and a half years.\n\n \r\nTestes take two and a half years.\n\n\r\nThe bones take seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell.\n\n \r\nYou have to do that five times.\n\n Every cell in your body has to be replaced at least five times to get to the point where you're completely whole, whole, and natural and healthy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou mean you're not replacing them with good cells yet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou take somebody who's not well, and when they reproduce, their offspring will not be so healthy?\n\n They'll have toxins built into it.\n\n\r\nRight.\n\n So, it takes 40 years for humans to go through that cycle, 40 years.\n\n In Howell and Pottenger's work, what they did was, as soon as the cat or rat reproduced, and the next offering was going, they would kill that animal and then perform autopsies and do tests on it to see the changes.\n\n\r\nAnd it took five generations.\n\n Well, we don't have to wait five generations of our offspring.\n\n We have to wait five generations and cellular transition.\n\n It's about 40 years.\n\n And that's if you're 100%, if you're not 100%, it could take a lifetime, you know, 50, 60, 80 years, all depends.\n\n And that all depends upon how healthy you want to be.\n\n\r\nI'm one of those who never wants to have another day of my own purposeful lack of energy and illness.\n\n I just don't want to have that.\n\n I want to see how healthy I can get and I'm only 21 years into my 40 years.\n\n So, I'm only halfway and I'm already satisfied.\n\n Even after I got my butt kicked, I still made it I'm here.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) How Much Meat Can A Child Eat (x) \n \n \n \n \n### (39) How To Get Rid Of Heavy Metals \n \nWell, there are different things I recommend\n\n\r\n-Coconut cream\r\n-Cilantro\r\n-Dark Berries\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Ionizers Leave Room \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but just make sure they're not on while you're in the room\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there any other particular equipment you might like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour Alpine equipment is pretty good?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow about a fan.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMake sure it's three feet from you because the EMF field?\n\n\r\nJust make sure you're not in the room when they're on.\n\n Because they will change the atomic structure of the air and it's not conducive to health.\n\n It burns nerve tissue.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) LA Water \n \nThere's no way, unless you're, going to put those ingredients in water, then your body can't reabsorb it, but not like, even if you don't have those things in it, you're not likely to reabsorb what you've exhibited, but you're likely to absorb the chemicals are in the water\n\n \r\nIf I get into LA city water, without those ingredients, I cannot stay in there longer than 7 minutes and I got to get out of there like I'd had 10 cups of coffee and I mean, I am buzzing, my heart's going 90 miles an hour and I'm just shaking.\n\n So, I can't do that.\n\n Here I've got my own well, so I don't' have all that problem.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Lymph System - Lymph Massage \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo get that stuff liquid again\n\n So, you can get it moving out of the lymph system.\n\n Because the lymph system is responsible for cleaning the body.\n\n And if the lymph system isn't moving, our arteries, heart congestion is going to keep collecting.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould lymph massage help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, lymph massage is the worst thing you can do?\n\n Lymph massage is a deep tissue massage.\n\n They go down, crack your veins in your circulatory system, your nerves and your lymph system.\n\n Rolfing is the worst, but any kind of deep tissue massage that isn't gradual.\n\n If they're going to go deep, they have to start lightly and move in slowly.\n\n\r\nSo, they're not ripping and breaking things.\n\n I suggest that you do just the tickle therapy.\n\n If you take your hand and you go over your hair, you'll get a tingling, do it to each other.\n\n So over here, hair, on your arm said, hope tingled goes through your entire body.\n\n What more stimulation could you want that.\n\n When I have a massage, that's what I have them do?\n\n\r\nI have him do my entire body tickle therapy.\n\n You barely touch my skin.\n\n You just go over like that entire body.\n\n And it generates everything.\n\n The therapist when they're finished with me, they're more red than I am because they're getting all this energy from me as well.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Make Up For Sleep By Sleeping More \n \nShe asked if you haven't been getting enough sleep\n\n Can you make it up by sleeping more.\n\n Yes, you can, just remember that 90% of cellular division happens in the sleep state?\n\n So healing, 90% of the healing happens in the sleep.\n\n\r\nAfter I got my but kicked on this, I was sleeping 10, 12 hours a day.\n\n It was me, you know, I'm usually four and a half hours a day, person, five hours a day, maximum sleeping.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDid you get up at a time and eat food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yes?\n\n I never slept more than three hours at a time.\n\n Four hours.\n\n Always like, of course I don't have to set an alarm.\n\n\r\nI got my own internal alarm.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Milk Alone High In Sugar \n \n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOr you can just have plain milk, right\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar?\n\n Milk by itself isn't good at that hour It's high in sugar.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nWhat about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that's at night?\n\n That's not when you're waking up after 5 hours.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHe said 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep and when you get up and have another 4 ounces, that's colostrum, is that like milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nColostrum is a little different  than milk?\n\n It's very different from milk.\n\n\r\nIf you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night you can have a glass of colostrum.\n\n Higher in fat and hormones, less sugar.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Milkshake Recipe \n \n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow many eggs do you have to make\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends on me?\n\n You know, I got the recipe in the recipe book.\n\n \r\n-1 to 3 eggs\r\n- 2 to 3 ounces of cream\r\n- 3 to 5 ounces of milk\r\nDepends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Monsanto Trying To Destroy Animals \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nE\n\ncoli 157 is a fiction.\n\n\r\nMonsanto's trying to destroy all the animals in the world, so that any animal that you will get, they will have genetically engineered and patented.\n\n\r\nThat way, if ever you have an animal that you raised, you have to pay them royalties.\n\n That is the whole idea.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Mother Not Producing Milk \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe lady who showed us to have her baby in a hospital\n\n And the doctor decided very quickly and with labor, she now has the baby and wants to nurse the baby.\n\n She is not producing enough.\n\n Now they're having a formula, any suggestions.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLots of milk and eggs, milk, raw milk, a little bit of honey, a lot of cream?\n\n Oh yeah.\n\n This formula is very toxic.\n\n Mostly made with soy.\n\n\r\nYeah, it works.\n\n If the mother is also getting enough other protein from eggs or meat, otherwise it doesn't work.\n\n\r\nI mean it will help them build porosity, but it doesn't help them build a good fat.\n\n\r\nShe asked how many eggs a day I eat,  anywhere from four to 20.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou were talking about the baby formula, I wasn't breast fed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, that's the problem.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nAnd I was told by my doctor that I was a very fat baby.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCongratulations, a wonderful thing.\n\n A fat baby is a very protected baby, a skinny baby is one where the brain will be damage by any toxins that enter the body.\n\n\r\nI like fat babies, I like fat people.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Mucus Discharges Poisons \n \nDepends on what's causing it\n\n I mean if it's heavy metals coming out through your mucous membranes, you're not going to stop it.\n\n All you can do is just produce enough mucus to keep it from being problem.\n\n And that means eating lots of eggs with dairy to create enough mucus to protect your mucous membrane.\n\n But I can see by the whites of your eyes, that you have a lot of toxicity in your bone marrow, that means you have a lot of heavy metals in your bone marrow, and that's going to create a problem in any of these bones right here, you're going to detox out of your sinuses.\n\n So, you're going to have an allergy problem all your life, until all that's relieved.\n\n So, the only thing you can do is make sure that you produce enough mucus to protect those mucus membrane and to discharge the poisons.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Need To Gain Weight - Over Acidity \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have this acid reflux that causes this cough continually after I eat, when I lay down at night\n\n My teeth, my gums are bleeding continually.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're way too thin.\n\n You don't have any fat to bind with anything.\n\n So, all these acids are getting into your blood, into your lymph and to your neurological system.\n\n They're burning your system.\n\n\r\nYou have to get fat in a condition like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm eating lots, I've been on it 16 months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot enough.\n\n I mean, you should be 30 pounds heavier with that kind of condition.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI put on 60-70 pounds.\n\n I took off 10 of that already.\n\n I mean, I didn't try.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition, like that, it permeates their system, unless there is that excessive fat in the blood, lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be saved.\n\n You're always going to have symptoms.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Nervous System Detoxes At Night \n \n \n \n \n### (51) No Fruit Afte 6 In Afternoon \n

After 6PM \n \n \n \n \n### (53) No Honey After High Meat \n \n**[2004],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEven after high meat, you can have the honey with your mate 20 minutes later\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf I'm having high meat, I wait 15 minutes before I eat my regular meat meal.\n\n I have my high meat, wait 15 minutes to have my regular meat meal and then wait until I finish the meat meal before I have my honey.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) No Milk&Honey&Butter With High Meat \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why I say, you don't have a honey with high meat\n\n \r\nYou don't have milk with high meat either, the lactic acid in the milk will destroy the bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you drink it down with water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't drink it down with anything, but you can with water if you're going to do anything use water?\n\n I just chew it and down it.\n\n\r\nYeah, then I'll rinse my mouth out if I don't like the taste, but I like the taste.\n\n \r\nI like it.\n\n It's not a problem, but never take butter with high meat\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) No Vegetable Juice For Children \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUh, because children have a lot of HGA, which is human growth hormone\n\n You know, when we reached 21, 25, we stop producing it.\n\n If we don't eat raw meat, we're never going to manufacture it again.\n\n We eat raw meat than we will, and we will still continue to have growth hormones.\n\n But children, even if they don't eat meat, they have growth hormones, 99% of them.\n\n\r\nWhat that causes is an alkaline condition in there blood.\n\n So, if they drink the vegetable juice, they become too over alkaline, then they become repulsed to meat and even to dairy, and then they won't eat those foods and then they get cranky.\n\n They start going for sugars and then it's unruly and unmanageable.\n\n And then it's when you don't want to have children *laughs*.\n\n\r\nSo, you don't want them to have vegetable juice, but maybe one day a week.\n\n And then you can usually tell they get a little red around the mouth and they're getting a little acidic, a little red around the eyes, red around the ears, they're getting over acid, but it only takes one cup and their back, even a half a cup for a child that size.\n\n\r\nSo, you need to use much parsley and children's juice should be only maybe 5% parsley and 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.\n\n\r\nThe parsley causes them to get really alkaline, overly alkaline in their intestines and blood.\n\n That's the most alkalinizing besides concrete.\n\n So, it has to be minimized.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou say they tend to lose their appetite when they become over alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes , when your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline, you lose appetite for meat?\n\n You just start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you had the juice and you don't have an appetite after the juice, it could that you are over alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo much for you?\n\n Then you shouldn't be drinking that much juice, or you should skip that particular juice at that time of day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Over Alkalinity - No Craving For Meat \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOver alkaline, yes\n\n When your digestive tract and your blood become over alkaline you lose your appetite for meat.\n\n You start craving sugars, and sugars, and sugars.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you have the juice and don't have any appetite after the juice it could be that your are becoming over alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo much for you, you shouldn't be drinking that much juice or you should skip that particular juice at the time of day?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Overacidity & Slant Bed Upwards \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm telling you what I've seen work, you know, and when you have somebody that has an acid condition like that, it permeates their system, unless there's that excessive fat in the blood lymph and neurological system and tissues, you're not going to be safe\n\n You're always going to have symptoms.\n\n\r\nAnd if you sleep, you better sleep at a slant.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI tried that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it keeps the lungs from collapsing, if you're lying straight the acids seep into the lungs.\n\n The lungs can collapse and be hard to breathe properly.\n\n When you've got it at a slant, you don't have the gravitational weight as a hindrance to breathing.\n\n\r\nYou're elevated like this, feet are this way,  the legs are this way and the bodies at an angle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI tried that didn't do any good, lifted the head in my bed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut you had your feet down this way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I lifted just the head of the bed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHow can you lift just the head.\n\n If you're lifting the head of the bed, the whole bed is gonna crank?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere were bricks underneath it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHere's the bed, you put bricks under here, the whole beds gonna slant upward.\n\n What you have to do is you have to get the bed like a hospital bed, this level where you're from the waist up at a high angle what you can do is get one of those rectangular shaped pillows or put on your body or use three pillows to layer it.\n\n\r\nSo, you're at that angle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd what about the gums and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI say you've got all those metals leaving the nervous system going out the teeth?\n\n So, keep honey and butter in your mouth.\n\n You absorb those acids or cream to keep a little bit of cream in your mouth.\n\n Honey & butter mixture.\n\n It should be about eight butter to one honey for the mouth acid.\n\n\r\nWhat acid fruit are you talking about tomato.\n\n Grapefruit is fine?\n\n It all depends upon the individual.\n\n I tell people to their their fruit in the afternoon and not after 6-7 o'clock because it could interrupt the whole system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Parasites, Tapeworms \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA tapeworm lives in the intestines on high carbs\n\n So, as long as you're discarding high-carbohydrate waste into your intestine.\n\n Those are going to be your friends.\n\n The tapeworm only lives in a third world environment where there's only grains.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSomebody said that when they got the monkfish livers that they found worms in it.\n\n They would find worms in the monkfish or red snapper.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose are not tapeworms, we're talking about a tapeworm.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n But my one was like, it was like a round worm.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPinworm, that lives on the intestinal walls.\n\n\r\nIt lives in the intestinal walls like it does in the tripe of the chicken and what they are eating is toxic protein.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy does my one come out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt probably got too toxic?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMaybe because of the raw diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n It's like I say, lives on your intestinal walls.\n\n It doesn't have anything to do with what you're eating.\n\n Tapeworm lives on what you're eating, pinworm lives on your intestinal walls because of the toxicity.\n\n\r\nYou need to have them.\n\n If you don't have the pinworm, your intestines could go into cancer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, there's no danger from them going to organs and things like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you ate just cooked carbohydrates your entire life, possible?\n\n Infiltrates the tissue, or if you got poisoned by something that would completely destroy the integrity of cellular divisions it could.\n\n But that would take a mass poisoning right there.\n\n Say a fish gets into an area with high mercury contamination or high radioactivity.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Parsely Too Alkaline For Children \n \nSo, you don't need to use much parsley in children's juice\n\n Should be only maybe 5% parsley and, you know, 90% celery, maybe 5% cucumber.\n\n\r\nThe parsley causes them to get really alkaline.\n\n Overly alkaline in the intestine and blood, that's the most alkalizing thing beside concrete, so it has to be minimized.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) Pasteurized Milk  & Osteoporosis \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to understand that pasteurized milk causes a lot of osteoporosis and a lot of hardening of the bone\n\n A lot of people get broken bones from eating pasteurized dairy because of the minerals that are cauterized.\n\n So concentrated in minerals that it collects in the system.\n\n When I had the fermented milk, it started clearing out of my tissues.\n\n\r\nA lot of those cauterized minerals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat would you use to detox old grains and breads.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just take those grains?\n\n If you were eating rye bread, then you use rye.\n\n And you let them soak in a lot of water for about three days till they start fermenting and getting mold on them.\n\n Then you eat just a little bit of it, but you don't do a lot unless you want to go through a heavy detoxification.\n\n So I don't know how much I'm scarred.\n\n\r\nI still have, you know, the sore, you see the spots.\n\n You know, the little sore from where the hives came out and blistered my skin, see the dark spots.\n\n Uh, I've got them all over here and some on my chest.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nLike black spots.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, little dark spots?\n\n See them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Peppermint Oil For Termites \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFumigating sounds bad, probably is bad\n\n How do I get rid of these guys without having them destroy.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll you have to do is get some mint juice.\n\n Get some mint, like I grew up peppermint all around here, juice that and just start spraying it all around and it will soak into the wood and they cannot eat it now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAre they going to go somewhere else now er.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey'll go somewhere?\n\n Oh, kill them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThose are in there under the home because all I have remnants of is our waste, they built pinholes and they push the waste out.\n\n Inject down those holes or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, get some mint juice and just start pouring it all around?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDoes actually growing the plant help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it does help?\n\n It will also keep ants away; ants will not burrow into ground where mint is growing.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow long does it last.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf it soaks into the wood, it's forever?\n\n Especially if it has worm holes already in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBoric acid powders.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, boric acid powders and if you breathe it, it can cause deteriorations of your respiratory system, \r\nYeah, but also it gases though, say if it rains and moisture gets into the framework, it gases, and you have to deal with those vapors?\n\n \r\nThese things were known naturally ages ago, they had fields of mint and they would just grind it into a liquid and just start dumping, treating the wood that way before it even got into a house.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nOh, so they would build houses with mint treated wood.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh yeah?\n\n Egyptians were heavy with that when they didn't use rock, they preferred rock.\n\n But when they used wood, they were always mint treating.\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n \r\nUsing baking soda as a deodorant.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no, terrible! Diluted lemon juice is the best thing for that?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Places With Good Air Quality \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there a way to kind of more on a localized basis to monitor air quality\n\n In other words, I'm kind of looking for another place to live, but I want to pick some place where the air is better.\n\n You know what I mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCan't get better than this area and the further you go into the city, the more toxic you get?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about like Altadena, higher up.\n\n Are they better or not?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTerrible! There's a whole toxic layer that sits up there, right up on the mountain, halfway up the mountain?\n\n And that layer is probably 1500 feet thick.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWow, cause I was at the impression-\r\n\n\r\n if you ever go up in a small plane and you look at the layers, you'll see.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBest area you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnywhere along the beach?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre there any like parts or anything, where do they actually do give you like a more specific report on the air.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey won't do that?\n\n Everybody would be discouraged.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Then how do you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI used to do some tests?\n\n\r\nI took flight lessons.\n\n I saw the layers.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Poisons Collect In Fat & Organs \n \n**[Lewis],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne time I thought I heard you say that poisons and hormones collect primarily in the organs of the animals-\r\n\n\r\nCorrect, in the fat, and the organs\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So, uh, just how bad is the muscle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not bad, most of the poisons go to the fat and the glands.\n\n That's why I won't eat glands from an animal, unless it's an organic animal.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Purpose Of High Meat - Digest Meat \n \n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nUh, when you're making high fish, what will the high fish do for you\n\n What will it help?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n Anytime you are making high meat, the whole purpose is for bacteria to break down the meat.\n\n Normally in our digestive tracts we have a lot of bacteria that breaks down meat.\n\n\r\nNot only hydrochloric acid, but bacteria, salmonella, E.\n\ncoli.\n\n E.\n\ncoli  is the last final digestion of meat.\n\n And then E.\n\ncoli is the most important bacteria there is.\n\n It helps you synthesize B-vitamins and amino acids.\n\n It takes that protein and breaks it down into the finest form.\n\n It's a backup for your immune system.\n\n\r\nWhen you take meat and you fill it full of bacteria, whether you're coating it with E.\n\ncoli the E.\n\ncoli breeds on it, what you are doing is introducing bacteria into your body that will help you digest meat, period.\n\n That's what it's for.\n\n If you want to go into detoxification, you have to ferment that meat severely.\n\n\r\nYou have to let it go into a liquid where all the protein is already predigested by the bacteria and it's high in alcohol.\n\n That's a bacteria detoxification and that is an extremely hard point to get to.\n\n You have to let your meat sit for 6, 7, 8, 10 months before we will come become completely liquid like that.\n\n Bacteria in high meat is to help you to just meat, period.\n\n That is what it's for.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Raw Honey & Babies \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all, cause they don't know any better\n\n\r\n⁠When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it, it produces an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carb into enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly protein.\n\n So, it has the protein for digesting protein.\n\n\r\nIt's like a solvent that helps break down cellular structures of meat and eggs.\n\n Anything that's high in protein.\n\n Once you heat it above 93 degrees, that is neutralized or destroyed, the hotter it gets the more destroyed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat degrees.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n93 degrees?\n\n\r\nSee the bees fan the hive and keep it at 92.\n\n8.\n\n If the top of the hive goes above 92.\n\n8 for very long, for an hour and a half, they will abandon it.\n\n They will go to a lower area and they will never eat that honey, unless they're starving.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nI was real skeptical, I deal with Honey Pacifica and Aajonus, I went to the hive desert with him, I stuck my hand in the hive.\n\n It was 109 degrees out, but the hive was 75.\n\n\r\nAnd many times we've watched the bees not to be able to keep the hive below 93 degrees, they're gone.\n\n So this is exactly right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, what happens is if the baby has a concentrated sugar without the insulin-\r\nSee when the bees get back to the hive they vomit.\n\n\r\nSo, honey is nectar predigested vomit.\n\n That's what honey is.\n\n Once it's heated,  that insulin substance is neutralized.\n\n So, when it gets into the baby's system, it's too much sugar.\n\n It gets into the blood and nervous system and it can cause anaphylaxis just like a drug.\n\n And let me tell you most honeys are treated.\n\n\r\nThey are filtered with a filter that has high chemical reactions in it.\n\n They're also subjected to cleansers.\n\n And then if the baby gets that poison, you go into an anaphylaxis shock.\n\n \r\nUnheated honey never has caused a problem and I had babies a month old.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n The next thing to know is that there is no law.\n\n There is no legal description of what the word raw means, That includes cheese, honey, oil, cold pressed, and so if you go to a honey or a beekeeper.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey'll tell you it's raw because they believe it's raw.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nThen when you go and check out their operation, it's heated to 120 degrees in the jar.\n\n They still don't believe that is heating.\n\n They believe it's warming.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCold pressed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCold spun?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs it okay to mix raw honey in a meat dish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nSometimes I got piece of tough meat or tough fat and I'll put a piece of honey on it and it almost dissolves it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (66) Sauna Too Hot \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI like the idea of heat, but saunas I do not like, they're too hot\n\n By the time they get through the third layer of skin, they damage the enzyme content in the skin and the vitamin content, and then start affecting the connective tissue.\n\n They also burn the mucous membrane.\n\n  \r\nSteam is the same thing; it can even be worse because that gets into the lungs.\n\n Because in the sauna you can clear the air by the time it gets past the bronchial, but with steam it will actually get into the lungs and damage the lung walls.\n\n So, hot baths, hot water bottles.\n\n That is what you should use to help yourself perspire to get rid of the poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about setting the sauna at low temperatures.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it depends how long you stay in there?\n\n Again, it's dry.\n\n You're going to create cracking on your skin.\n\n When you get into a bath where you have moisture in there and you have milk in the water, you have some vinegar and you have some sea salt, it's going to help you attract with a magnetic force of all those substances to help pull those toxins out of your skin.\n\n  \r\nSo, your skin isn't going to have to work as hard.\n\n If you're in a sauna or a steam room, your skin gets damaged.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Soy Fed Chicken - Less Better \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no\n\n Rosie is a terrible chicken.\n\n Rocky Junior.\n\n\r\nRosie feeds theirs 75% to 80% soy.\n\n Soy has to be cooked and processed.\n\n Raw soy will kill a human and will kill birds.\n\n So, they have to treat the soy before they feed it.\n\n So, it doesn't matter that the soybean was raised organically.\n\n Once it's treated with a solvent.\n\n It is a chemical.\n\n It is no longer organic.\n\n\r\nSo, it is a lie, it's misrepresented.\n\n It's miss advertising.\n\n Rosie organic is not organic.\n\n\r\nRocky Junior, the[Kathyy feed theirs 75-80% raw corn.\n\n The rest of it is soy, but I can't get them to stop feeding them soy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're feeding them a certain amount of soy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSoy, but it's a small amount compared to Rosie or any other chickens?\n\n Sheldon does the same thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about James' chicken, is that alright.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJames gets Rocky?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do they feed them soy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSoy's an easy protein, fatten them up, build the muscle?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt's not gonna bother you if you get that 20% in you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Your body can handle it?\n\n If it's eating enough fat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (68) Stye - Use Lemon \n \n \n \n \n### (69) Swordfish Aajonus Fav Fish \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSwordfish is okay\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's still my favorite?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) Third Worl Countries Parasites From Carbs \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd there are some people who are in third world countries that live completely on cooked starches, and they don't get meat\n\n So, what happens is they get parasites, and they have to help them eat that sugar decay, so it doesn't dissolve their whole body.\n\n Some people die of malnutrition.\n\n They're not dying of the parasite.\n\n \r\nThey're dying of malnutrition and the breakdown that the advanced glycation end products and acrylamides are causing in their body.\n\n But again, it's a food contamination, it's not the parasite or the bacteria causing the problem.\n\n \r\nFlies do the same thing; flies secrete a fluid that dissolves matter.\n\n That's part of their digestion, it happens in the mouth, frogs do the same thing.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIf you eat something from a fly, it lands on the food, it may lay an egg- you may have an egg or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEven if it puts that fluid down, it's not going to hurt you.\n\n You're not eating enough.\n\n \r\nIt's not bacteria, we have 23,000 varieties of bacteria in our mouth.\n\n The human being is the most toxic and you're looking at bacteria.\n\n The most toxic salivary juices in the world.\n\n 2,300 various bacteria in the human mouth.\n\n How many people have you killed that you bit.\n\n \r\nIt's all bullshit?\n\n This whole bacteria thing is bullshit.\n\n The main enzyme we have is the Tylen enzyme and that breaks down sugar.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIt's the same thing if a dog bites you, you're not gonna get rabies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot likely?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (71) Too Much Milk Causes Mineral Buildup \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUm, I have been doing a lot of strength and health\n\n And recently I met a dance teacher and I spent four days doing all these dances I've never done before.\n\n And my knees just became swollen, what causes that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's because you never got married?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nNo, what that usually is is toxic fats leaving your knees.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\nSo, I just overstimulated like a detox from all the dancing because I wasn't used to that kind of hopping.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you also have to understand you were a big milk drinker.\n\n You didn't eat a lot of meat for the first three years on the diet.\n\n You mainly ate milk and didn't eat much meat and much butter.\n\n You were a milk drinker.\n\n\r\nMilk is highly concentrated in minerals, low in fat, not high enough in fat for the toxic as we are.\n\n So, you just kept collecting a lot of minerals with poisons.\n\n And when it comes out to the joints, it will cause tremendous swelling.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (72) Too Much Vege Juice Lose Appeteite For Meat \n \nIf an adult drinks a lot of green juice and they lose their appetite for meat, they're drinking too much juice\n\n Green vegetable juice.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (73) Vegetable Oils Are Crystals \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nYou take a raw vegetable oil and mix it with dirt and in a year it will be rock\n\n You take animal fat and mix it with dirt, it'll mold and become earth.\n\n And it does that in the human body, hardens in the system.\n\n Amber is a rock from resin from a tree.\n\n Almost all your crystals are vegetable oils, vegetable fats.\n\n\r\nThey don't break down in the system easily and once they've been cooking in the body, they never turn liquid until it reaches 102 degrees.\n\n So, you have to have lots of hot baths from a 102 to 105 degrees, and you have to stay in there for an hour to an hour and a half at a time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (74) Viruses Are Solvents \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nJust remember, virus are not alive\n\n This whole contagious shit about mosquitoes carrying virus, and all kinds of things.\n\n That's like you taking soap with you and saying that it's contagious.\n\n Soap is not contagious.\n\n It does not self-replicate, I don't care how many homes have tide in it.\n\n You cannot prove that it self-replicates.\n\n  \r\nThe body makes solvent to dissolve compounds in your body.\n\n If you were so toxic that your body can't use a bacteria or a parasite or other live organisms to break that cell down that became tissue, your body has to make a soap, a solvent.\n\n That's what viruses are.\n\n \r\nYou look at any book, ask any good microbiologists, they'll tell you virus are protein bodies.\n\n They're not alive.\n\n They can't reproduce, but yet they self-replicate.\n\n Hello.\n\n They are soap, they are solvent.\n\n They even admit when you look in any biology book, you cannot find a virus outside of a live cell environment.\n\n Why.\n\n Because the cells are the producing the virus?\n\n \r\nThey don't self-replicate.\n\n A cell has to manufacture the soap.\n\n We manufacture soap all the time.\n\n We manufacture alcohol all the time.\n\n We'll take a carbohydrate and ferment it in our intestines, take the alcohol we'll make a solvent out of it.\n\n They'll dissolve the toxicity in the system.\n\n That's what a virus is.\n\n It's a refined, specific, highly densified protein body, solvent, that'll just dissolve matter.\n\n \r\nIt's not the nicest way to get rid of the toxins.\n\n The bacteria and parasites can consume decaying tissue and reduce it to a micro amount of what it was.\n\n It's like we can do 13 pounds of food in a day and pass a half a pound turd the next day.\n\n Well, if a parasite gets ahold of some tissue, it can reduce it to a hundredth of a percent of what it was and reduce that toxicity into a very small amount.\n\n So, it isn't so difficult to get rid of.\n\n  \r\nWhen the body uses a solvent, what happens when we use a solvent.\n\n we dilute it with water and then we contaminate everything else?\n\n And we have this whole bucket of contaminated water.\n\n It's the same thing happens in the human body.\n\n \r\nWe have virus, bacteria, and parasites to help us, detoxification is mitigated.\n\n When our body uses solvents, it's distributed a lot more toxic.\n\n That's why doctors are more afraid of viral meningitis than a bacterial meningitis, because the fluids become immense when we're scraping down all that toxic matter from the nervous system and mostly it's heavy metals, free radicals that go in and do tremendous damage to other areas of the body, which you don't normally destroy when parasites and bacteria are active.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nTalking parasite, are you talking a one cell parasite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm talking about any parasite?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSome of them can kill you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, they can't?\n\n You die from the treatment of amoebic dysentery, you take antibiotics, it destroys your ability to digest, and you die.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (75) What To Drink At Night \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDrinking the juice at night, you don't want to drink the juice\n\n You want to eat some meat or eat some eggs or a milkshake, you go to sleep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about in the middle of the night, take a milkshake too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you wake, yeah?\n\n If you don't wake, set an alarm after 5 hours.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOr can just have plain milk, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can have plain milk, but it isn't as good because it's high in sugar?\n\n Milk by itself isn't good at that hour.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nWhat about on the weight loss where you recommend a glass of milk at night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that's not when you wake up after 5 hours.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou said you can have 4 ounces of milk before you go to sleep, then you get up and haev another 4 ounces.\n\n Is that colostrum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nColostrum is a little different from milk?\n\n it's very different from milk.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, colostrum you can have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you have colostrum available and you wake up in the middle of the night, you can have a glass of colostrum?\n\n Higher in fat and hormone, less in sugar.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo then you'll have a four ounces of milkshakes one time and then have the other four ounces.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou could do that?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut it makes it up to 4 ounces doesn't it.\n\n How many eggs should I put it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends, you know I've got the recipe in the recipe book?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOne egg.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you could have 1 to 3 eggs?\n\n 2 - 3 ounces of cream, and 3 - 5 ounces of milk, depends upon how big you are and how much you want to drink.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (76) Whole Foods Feeds Their Cows

cause severe damage\n\n Just give you an idea of some of the damage that has occurred.\n\n If you go to Calgary University in Canada, their website, you're gonna order a DVD, which shows what happens if you put a 2% solution of mercury into neuron development.\n\n \r\nNow, all neurons on any species, no matter if it's an insect or a human or a bird.\n\n No matter what it is, all neurons develop  and grow the same way.\n\n So, all of the brain develops the same way no matter what species you are.\n\n So, you see all these neurons growing and they've got this DVD and they put a 2% solution of mercury and all of a sudden, you just see them disappear, just eats them away.\n\n And then they have another phase of that DVD where they show that a molecule of mercury will cause an entire cell or group of cells to lock to that one piece of mercury, and that's what causes neurons to disintegrate.\n\n \r\nAluminum doesn't do that, and a lot of the other heavy metals don't do that.\n\n The heavy metals and lighter metals don't do that.\n\n \r\nThe mercury does it every time, and there's a lot of mercury in everything, everything that's in our environment, and if you ever used merthiolate or mercurochrome, those are liquid mercury antiseptics.\n\n If you've ever had vaccine, you've had liquid mercury injected into you with almost every vaccine, and they store in the body and if they get released into the blood or neurological system, they'll cause a deterioration of the nerves and the neurons in the brain.\n\n So, that has a tendency to collect, and that's what causes your major diseases because your farmers didn't get the flu, your farmers didn't get the black plague.\n\n\r\nIt was only the concentrations of city people who got it or the city people who were so poor that they were thrown out into the farmlands and some of those got it.\n\n And they say, well, it all happens at one time, and if I had given you some poison in the food and everybody ate it, within a few hours, all of you would be sick.\n\n\r\nWell, the same kind of contamination will happen progressively about the same time.\n\n The major incidence of your poisoning, the reaction from it, the body's attempt to detoxify it will occur in a greater number of people within the same timeframe.\n\n Some people will be more contaminated sooner, some people later, but the majority will all get it about the same time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Baby Wont Breathe Until Out Of Placenta \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd you grab your knee, and she said it was so much smoother than I was like, wow, I'm making notes on that one\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd you don't have to worry about the baby drowning.\n\n The baby will not breathe until it's off that placenta.\n\n So, if the baby comes out in the water, you don't have to rush to keep it from drowning.\n\n\r\nIt can stay in there for two hours until the placenta drops.\n\n The baby will not start breathing unless you smack it or the placenta drops.\n\n You could smother an infant and you will not smother it.\n\n You could smother it, keep it from breathing after breathes for five minutes, take your hand off and it'll start breathing again.\n\n\r\nIt's used to not breathing it's whole life and it can go back into that very readily.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Best Juicer \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've already done that research pretty heavily, and the green stars is the only one where in my laboratory test proved were efficient\n\n  \r\nThere's a lot of propaganda out from other ones, especially the Norwalk, which is a $2,300 juicer.\n\n You grind it into one process and then you press in another, it double oxidizes.\n\n \r\nIn the green star and the green machines, they have two gears, which crush it and they're stainless steel, and some of its even surgical steel, part of its surgical steel, the recipe for surgical steel.\n\n So, it's good.\n\n It's not plastic pressing against plastic, its metal pressing against metal.\n\n  \r\nIf you have plastic pressing against plastic, like with the single gear juicers out there, you have the phthalates that generate gases from the plastic and PBA, PBD, PBBS PBAs that gas into the food, which are highly poisoned.\n\n So, your green stars, your green machines are the better ones.\n\n and it's right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThere's another company that patents the parts for green star and green star hasn't updated it since 1993.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's not supposed to last four days, it's supposed to last three days, so you're taking it too far.\n\n I use the green power cause the juice is faster.\n\n \r\nt's a larger machine.\n\n It's a larger horsepower, and it cuts about 5 to 10 minutes out of juicing if you're juicing lot large batches, but that's because they have a larger screen.\n\n  \r\nThe green star has a screen that's about this big, the Green Power has ones this big and the gears are about of 3/4 of an inch longer.\n\n \r\nSo, there's more grinding space and it's $100 more than a green star You can have it delivered to your door for $438 if you call John Lyshire with natures something.\n\n  \r\nThe Greenstar from him, that's more like $350 delivered to your door, so if you're juicing for more than one person, then I would go for the green power.\n\n \r\nNow they're not producing more of the Green Powers.\n\n They're not manufacturing more of them, So they probably have maybe 500 machines left in the world.\n\n So, when they're gone, they're gone.\n\n John L Y S H I R E I think it is.\n\n  \r\nToo many of the parts were cracking, but I had one for 10 years before I bought the new one.\n\n \r\nI bought the, the new Greenpower Kempo, and it's so fucking small and it took forever to choose with, so I went back to the old one.\n\n The green power Kempo is just a little bitty model, it's smaller than the Greenstar, so I just gave it away.\n\n  \r\nGreen Power Gold, Green Power Kempo, are the same company, however the Kemp is so small it takes forever to juice.\n\n The new technology is Kempo, and it takes too long to juice and you have to stop and clean it and clean it and clean it.\n\n So, the old technology is better as far as time and production.\n\n \r\nStick with the Greenstar and go with the Green Power, but not the Green Power Kempo, Green Power Gold.\n\n \r\nThere are 500 machines left, probably not even that, they do have parts, still parts available, but mine cracked all over the place when I was doing coconut and I got replacement parts and it's just don't screw those screws in too tightly, that's the thing that cracks it.\n\n  \r\nSo, I had it for two years without a crack in it, I had some guests over, screwed the hell out of it while I was out of the house and they cracked the machine by doing coconuts, just because they screwed those things into tightly, and that's what caused it to crack, but the Green Life and Greenstar were made by a different company, an offshoot, not a different company.\n\n \r\nThere were partners and they split and one of the partners made the Green Life and then the green star, And the original company, that partner made the Green Power Gold, which was the original and the Green Power Kempo.\n\n But the Green Power Kempo has great technology.\n\n It's so small, it's a pain in the ass.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Biokleen For Cleaning \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, I was thinking of, I know you told us to use the Biokleen for the laundry stuff, but what if you have a stain in your clothes\n\n Was there something else?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I still use the degreaser, Biokleen degreaser, for everything?\n\n \r\nBut don't follow their instructions and dilute it.\n\n If you dilute it, it doesn't work.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Carbs Vs Fat \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, carbohydrates burn fast, but they don't burn long and they don't give you stamina, and they also make you crazy\n\n**[unclear]**\n and like the other ones that throw golf clubs and throw tennis rackets, and that's high carbohydrate fast burning fuel.\n\n \r\nBut if you want to be a good athlete, you just need to eat a lubrication formula with your meat so that your pyruvate is slowly portioned out and your burning fat, not high carbohydrate.\n\n So, there's not a lot of waste.\n\n You get 2.\n\n5 calories with fat, over 1 with carbohydrate and protein.\n\n So, that's why your wrestlers are all fat, that's why your weight lifters are all fat.\n\n Your bodybuilders are mainly muscle, and not fat, but they don't have stamina like an athlete.\n\n\r\nSo, more fat, but it needs to be on a balanced system.\n\n But if you're an athlete, you need to have a lubrication formula with your meat meal.\n\n Say, for instance, I had Lucky, he's not here today, but you know he's a skinny guy.\n\n Like James was a really skinny guy when he first came.\n\n These people came to me in their fifties,  and I think lucky was 56.\n\n\r\nAnd he'd been on the diet for years, and he said, \"Hey, can I bodybuild on this diet\".\n\n And he always wanted to be built really well, but he was really skinny, 6' 1\", and never able to do it?\n\n And I said, \"Yeah, just eat a lubrication formula with your meat meal, eat a whole pound of meat at one time with a whole lubrication formula twice a day\".\n\n \r\nIt's very good for lubricating the body and reversing delipidization, which is dryness in the system.\n\n\r\nNo, like I said in the recipe book, as long as the lemon is mixed seven minutes beforehand the lemon juice is utilized in the fat, not in the meat.\n\n\r\nSo, it has to be a balanced diet again, but it just may, may need to have more pineapple to get rid of the uric acid and lactic acid build up from exercise.\n\n\r\nLucky.\n\n He put on four inches in his arms in two and a half months, six inches on his chest, and at Golds gym, they accused him of using steroids.\n\n He says, \"I'm telling you, it's the raw butter, the raw eggs and the raw meat\".\n\n Sure, sure.\n\n \r\nHe couldn't believe it because he'd been skinny all his life, and in 2.\n\n5 months he filled up.\n\n\r\nBananas are a little difficult on the liver, and they have a tendency to cause constipation.\n\n So, they're a little bit more difficult, when they're green, they're better.\n\n\r\nApes, and monkeys, except for the killer monkeys, eat bananas with the peel, they eat the peel and all green, it's alomy, oh my God, I can't even get enough saliva to swallow it that way.\n\n\r\nBut that's the way the apes and the monkeys that aren't killer monkeys eat them.\n\n So, the killer monkeys go on these killing sprees after eating 24 hours of overripe fermented fruit.\n\n Ripe bananas and figs.\n\n, and then they go on a killing spree wow.\n\n \r\nAll that high sugar rips all the fat out of their nervous system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cats Wont Eat Old Meat Only Dogs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey shouldn't be drinking green juice\n\n If they want, they'll go ahead and eat some grass and get the chlorophyll.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, but it won't eat any old meats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCats usually won't eat old meat, only dogs and vultures, and the others Cats like fresh meat normally.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's got dandruff.\n\n\r\nHis furs really soft, but he's still got dandruff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen he's just got a lot of toxins coming out through the skin.\n\n You have to understand cats, dogs do not perspire through their noses, mouth and asshole, and the penis.\n\n It's the only place they perspire.\n\n So, when they throw toxins off, they're not broken down.\n\n So, it goes into the skin, gets built into the skin, dries out the skin and flakes.\n\n\r\nAnd that kind of dandruff is is what causes so many allergies in people.\n\n It's just years that you're going have to feed her properly, until she's not throwing off all those heavy metals out through the skin causing dandruff.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Chl Birth I Nwarm Water, Ublical Cord \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nChild birthing, I heard that the native American Indians believe that when a child is born, you should keep the umbilical cord attached h and it will automatically stop for the baby\n\n\r\nHow long does that last if the cords still working after the baby's born.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nThe answer is each one is different and the cord will stop pulsing and you literally can just lightly hold it?\n\n\r\nYou can feel it when the heart the beat is gone, and that's when you clip it off.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it like 10 minutes.\n\n 30 minutes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, it can go up to two days?\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nFor me, it was anywhere from a half an hour to like two hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI heard if you nurse it immediately it soothes the baby.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nA lot of times the baby won't nurse.\n\n They don't know about the breasts yet.\n\n They just want to be close to the heartbeat like when they were inside in the warmth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's why I suggest people have babies in warm water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat totally seems so natural to me to do it that way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd the women who've been on the diet, who've had babies have had babies with only two contractions.\n\n \r\nThe last five that were born, two contractions.\n\n They crown with the first contraction, and pass it out in the second contraction.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it because we're.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you're better?\n\n\r\nBecause on a cooked diet it's impossible for the woman's body to work properly and all of those children were able to hold their head up at birth.\n\n\r\nThe placenta is the baby's liver until it starts eating.\n\n So, the placenta can live two days if the mother doesn't have any milk.\n\n You just have to keep that placenta warm if it drops out of the uterus.\n\n Usually if the mother's not producing milk, the placenta will stay attached and won't let go until the mother starts producing her milk.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nI wasn't on the raw diet those days.\n\n Placenta was the big issue was when that was going release and on its own, and you saw doctors.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\nIn most cases, three or four hours.\n\n In most cases with most of the women that I helped give birth, the placenta came out in 2, 3, 4 hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMost animals like the apes it comes out in 2 hours, and the female eats it.\n\n So, you gotta eat it *joking*.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Coconut Oil For Sunblock \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI think it's a good thing\n\n I always prefer using something that's whole, rather than an isolated something.\n\n However, if I use the coconut cream when I'm using a sunblock, it doesn't work as well, but if I use the coconut oil, it's a great sunblock.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Coconut Oil In Hair \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe coconut oil\n\n If you're going to put it on your scalp, you wanna put it on like your palm or on a plate, just a very thin layer.\n\n Put it on, separate your hair and go like this and put it all on your scalp.\n\n  \r\nYou get your hair too oily; it may look cool.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Coconut Oil Vs Cream \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCoconut cream is not the same\n\n The coconut cream soothes the tissue, coconut cream and coconut oil are very different.\n\n \r\nCoconut cream is soothing and healing as well as detoxifying.\n\n \r\nCoconut oil, and all of your pressed oils are mainly solvent reactive.\n\n\r\nThey mainly help degenerate, dissolve toxicity in the system, so they can help break down the fungus easier.\n\n However, the coconut cream might feed it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Cooking Meat, Uric Acid \n \n**[2005],[Jim]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPains like I'm having like Kathy, her foot is crystals, and apparently, it's inability to process uric acid\n\n Wouldn't even raw meat be increasing the uric acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt wouldn't no?\n\n If you don't digest the meat or you cook it.\n\n Are you partially cooking your meat.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay, then don't worry about it.\n\n You don't get any added uric acid from raw meat.\n\n It's only excessive uric acid from eating cooked things.\n\n  \r\nNo excessive uric acid from raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou can't possibly sear meat on the barbecue.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPart of it, maybe a third of it's gonna be toxic, two thirds won't be?\n\n So, you're gonna use a third of the two thirds that's nontoxic to negate the toxicity from the third, so you can have a third of it that's good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut technically it should be on a pan, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou shouldn't be cooking it at all at all?\n\n \r\nI would say barbecue is better than pan fried.\n\n Frying is the worst thing you can do.\n\n It keeps turning over the heat of the fat molecules reburning them and reburning them.\n\n  \r\nOver the fire it's dripping, you're losing it, but you're not going to eat the recooked and recooked fat molecule.\n\n \r\nBut as long as you're not putting any kinda lighter fluid on your charcoal.\n\n \r\nPropane is quite a bit of toxicity in the gas.\n\n like any it's like any kind of gas.\n\n \r\nNatural gas is different.\n\n Natural gas doesn't have that kind of toxicity.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Cucumber For Erection \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's like a Viagra\n\n Yeah.\n\n It's not like Cialis, which will work 36 hours, but it will certainly keep you, like I had last night.\n\n I was thirsty and I just didn't want a tomato.\n\n I didn't want anything else, but a nice cool cucumber.\n\n So, I peeled the sucker and I ate it.\n\n\r\nI had an erection all night.\n\n I woke every few hours and this Woody was there and nobody to do anything with.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you eat the peel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but I didn't find it worked as well?\n\n There's something in the pulp.\n\n\r\nAnd they allow 5% petroleum.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI agree with you.\n\n I'm glad you mentioned that because Jeff and I just got into a little discussion here, but I've noticed that they're even if they're organic, they're wax and I always peel 'em.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPeel em anyway if you have an erection problem.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Dhea \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about the DHEA\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDHEA is a chemical?\n\n If you get it in a brain, it's fine, but the chemically produced DHEA is not a complete substance.\n\n It's a chemical.\n\n It shouldn't even be called DHEA.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Dont Clean Baby \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Native Americans used to rub in the afterbirth into the baby's skin because t's actually the moisture, whereas in the hospital where they, they immediately wash it off, and that's why a lot of the infants get the chapped flaky skin\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's already in the tissue because they've been soaking in that for almost 10 months.\n\n So, it's in their skin, but they'll usually use antiseptic, a detergent to wash the baby.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nI did everything with the home birth and in many cases the skin would start to shrivel because they'd go wash the baby off, and they did learn that if you didn't wash the baby off, most of the time that didn't happen to that intense degree.\n\n\r\nBecause that goes away fairly shortly after, a day or two, that doesn't last long.\n\n \r\nAre you pregnant.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, no, but we've just been fascinated by this?\n\n\r\nWell, actually we will in a year hopefully, but a friend of ours had birth through a midwife and it's interesting that she had her first child in the hospital and she tore and Benjamin was actually maybe six pounds, so he was smaller.\n\n She just had a midwife and she had a baby about a week ago and this baby was larger by two pounds, she didn't tear and it was a midwife and she said the pregnancy was so much smoother, and she said it was great.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, she's been on a similar diet, 80% of the diet since the last kid too.\n\n She put on weight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Ebola, Mosquitos Don't Spread Disease \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd that's the way it was done\n\n That's the way you get rid of like the Ebola.\n\n Ebola is manmade and it is not contagious through mosquitoes.\n\n It's never ever been proven.\n\n And if you look at the behavior of a mosquito, you'll see that only the female bites.\n\n She's got a proboscis that if it were on me would be about the length from here to here.\n\n \r\nWhen she goes in, she digs down in and she bites every cell in a pool, in an area.\n\n So, she creates a pool of blood.\n\n They do not cast saliva.\n\n So, they eat all around.\n\n If anything were to get a piece of saliva or anything in there, doesn't matter because what does she do.\n\n She sucks up the whole pool of blood, every bit of it?\n\n \r\nSo, if any of her saliva got into that pool of blood, she's already sucked it up.\n\n It's gone.\n\n So, they pull down and they don't even eat it.\n\n She doesn't eat it.\n\n She goes back to her larva and the larva feed off of the blood.\n\n So, the myth that mosquito transport disease is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n \r\nIt's another thing like you'll get parasites if you eat raw meat.\n\n It comes from a myth.\n\n It does not come from any laboratory science.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThen when they say West Nile, this guy died from West Nile.\n\n What are they seeing in his body that they can connect it to west Nile.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nA lot of them will call any kind of a retrovirus activity, they'll just give it a name?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey're saying the mosquitos have it here right now.\n\n**[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n \r\nYeah, but that's your Dow chemical, Monsanto wanting to make a hundred million every time they drop \n on a city.\n\n They make fortunes doing that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey do that here in Riverside constantly.\n\n I'm hearing it on the news and I'm just like ughh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd there's no evidence, but because the politicians are completely ignorant biochemically, they accept anything they're told, and of course who's behind it.\n\n The chemical industries, doctors, the pharmaceutical industry and the chemical industry doctors are all behind it?\n\n So, don't worry about getting some kind of a disease from a mosquito or a swamp or anything like that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Eggs + Milk For Respiratory Problems \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnytime anybody has respiratory problems, including breathing; eggs, eggs, eggs, every hour, hour and a half to every two hours a day\n\n \r\nIf you need mucus and usually allergies become because your body's not creating enough mucus to block the pollens and the dirt that are in the air, so they get in there, irritate the mucus membranes.\n\n They dry them out more, they cause all the sneezing, the runny eyes cause the body's trying to break that down and take it out the tear ducts, out the throat, the nasal drip, out your ears.\n\n It's trying to dump it.\n\n You're a lacking mucus production, so you need to eat things like milk cream, honey, and eggs together.\n\n\r\nBut if you're having problem digesting like with people who have emphysema; egg, egg, egg, egg, until that point where you can digest properly, then it's milkshakes, milkshakes, milkshakes.\n\n So, you can produce enough mucus to heal and protect yourself.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Epidemics Are Pollution \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey definitely got rid of those\n\n They could have stopped a lot of those deaths, but they didn't want to because if they get rid of them, then they can allow a lot more poor people into this country to work at very low wages.\n\n That's what it's all about.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nCan I just quickly throw one thing on the last one.\n\n You kind of said that it's the people who got treatment are the ones that died?\n\n\r\nCause my question on it was like flu is a detoxification, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFlu is a virus?\n\n You can have bacterial detoxifications, mainly colds, anything that's bacterial, but flus, they say are all viral.\n\n Virus are not alive.\n\n Viruses are soaps made within the cell because the body's so contaminated or a cell is so contaminated.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\nSo, the cell or environment around the cell is so toxic that bacteria, parasites or fungus cannot break it down.\n\n So, the body makes soap solvents to dissolve it.\n\n Just like we have compounds, which will break down oil.\n\n It can disassemble and make it into a more water soluble substance, but what happens when you have that, you have a whole bucket of contaminated fluid, and that same thing happens in your body.\n\n When you have bacteria, parasites, or fungus eat things, it reduces the contamination to a small amount.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Flexibility and Hot Water Bottle \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's gonna take time\n\n You need to submerse it and the water to be at least 104°, and leave for about 45 minutes at a time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nTake a hot bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, cause then you're taking care of your whole body, your body's gonna use your nutrients on your whole body?\n\n  \r\nIf you want to focus on one particular area for cleansing and healing, you've gotta only focus on that spot, that area.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, the nutrients in your body are gonna be all used up on your whole body if you're getting into a bath.\n\n So, that will help.\n\n \r\nNo, you don't have to move it, but if you want to that will help.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Flu \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut when you have virus, it dissolves it and there's no consumption and resolution\n\n There's no shrinkage in the bacteria.\n\n There is a greater substance to be removed from the body.\n\n So, it's a lot more contaminating.\n\n It's not an easy detoxification.\n\n \r\nSo, when these people are so contaminated with industrial pollution that they can't use bacteria, parasites, or fungus help clean, they have to go through the viral and a lot of people will not survive that viral detoxification because they're not healthy enough.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh really.\n\n Detox can kill you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nViral detoxification can kill you?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGetting more poisons and more chemicals, makes it worse.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Flu Vs Bacterial Detox \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow do you know whether you're going through viral detox\n\n If you have the flu, whether it's bacteria or viral?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFlu is always viral.\n\n Cold may be mostly bacterial.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAchiness and throwing up is the flu.\n\n  \r\nAajonus] \r\nYeah?\n\n See, when you have a cold, it isn't so bad.\n\n You can work, you can function.\n\n The detox is normal, but when you have a flu, it's can be overwhelming because of all the mass contamination, mass contaminated fluids that have to be expelled from your body.\n\n \r\nNo, you want to go do more perspiring, hot baths to get it out, more smoothies, I mean, lots of milkshakes, maybe more fruit, more smoothies if you're having a viral.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Foods To Increase Memory \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe foods that will, usually fish and chicken together, or fish and beef together, and if combine eggs with that, make it a three process\n\n \r\nYou have the complete proteins that help the synapses, the axions and ganglia reaction.\n\n Fish, chicken, and eggs, or fish, beef and eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Gas Masks \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThen drops malathion and stay out of the air for about 30 hours\n\n Try not to go out, unless you're wearing a mask.\n\n I keep one in my car.\n\n I keep an Israeli gas mask in my car.\n\n It's got two compound filters, so I look like I'm fly.\n\n \r\nI cover my entire face.\n\n An army surplus story is where I get them.\n\n They're cheaper there.\n\n Y2K, they were selling like, normally they're $19, and then during Y2K, they were selling the same thing for $50, $55.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy do you have that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf there were some kind of chemical spill like malathion and I'm outside or in my car?\n\n \r\nI keep it in my car.\n\n I also keep one in the house just in case.\n\n $40 for two of them.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nDo they remove poisonous gases.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt helps because they they're compound filters?\n\n So, you've got HEPA filters and you've got charcoal filters and they're compound, they're about eight layers for each canister on each side.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDo you wear them for driving.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn Asia, the Asians don't mind?\n\n They're not as ego centered as we are or vain and a lot of 'em go around with masks on.\n\n When I'm in Asia and I'm on the highway there, or whether I'm in a car or on a bus, or on a motorcycle, I'm wearing a mask.\n\n \r\nBecause they use diesel, too much diesel and that's a lot of worse.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey have bandanas all around their face.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey make these things like this and they go around your ears and you just breathe right through it.\n\n I mean, it's not compounded, it's not for gas.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou couldn't bring one out there to here.\n\n You could buy one, and bring it home.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you got a problem here, you want a compound one to filter out gas?\n\n That mainly filters out particles, it doesn't filter out gas.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI'm talking about air pollution.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt will help filter out the heavy particles, but not the gas.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWe have a couple of those gas masks, I forget, how long does the filter last.\n\n We've been told anywhere for two hours to?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it depends on what you're exposed to.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI just wear it when I'm painting and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if you're painting, they'll last probably couple of weeks, about eight hours a day.\n\n  \r\nIf you're actually in some tear gas they're gonna last you maybe an hour and a half.\n\n \r\nWhat it does is stops cleaning and then the gas starts affecting you, but these were made for gas masks.\n\n For military gas and gas bombs.\n\n \r\nSo, the epidemics and all of that, it's mainly pollution.\n\n You don't hear it with native tribes, unless somebody's come in and poisoned their environment, coming down with any kind of disease that knocks them out.\n\n**[unclear]**\n in the early seventies.\n\n He was a British writer in Brazil and he was investigating it and he was in the bars in Brazil when these people were coming in, paying them $1,500 a week to slaughter as many natives out in they're in the Amazon as possible.\n\n and poisoning them.\n\n  \r\nThat's a commercial warfare, business warfare.\n\n Business is just like a government.\n\n If they want to overpower and they want to take possession of resources and property, it means killing people, getting rid of them, especially the welfare classes.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Grinding Meat, Use Food Processer \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nUsually, your electric grinders are high pressure, and when you put meat into a high-pressure grinder, it homogenizes the fat molecules\n\n Homogenization means it splits the fat molecule, so the fats absorb the protein.\n\n So, then it isn't digested properly to regenerate cells become younger and more alive.\n\n \r\nWhat it'll do is help you generate fuel, pyruvate to burn as fuel or for detoxification.\n\n But if you want to get stronger and younger and heal properly, don't have ground meat, unless you put it in a food processer, and I grind mine.\n\n I just put it in long thin slices and then put it in my food processer, and it turns on for three seconds, I've got ground meat with no high pressure, quickly.\n\n  \r\nSometimes you can chance it if you tell them to use the large stiff holes, not the small ones, and they put it through the high pressure and tell 'em put them only to put it through one time.\n\n They don't like doing it.\n\n \r\nStainless steel's fine, but most of your meat grinders are made with pop metal and not a real true stainless steel.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey flake into the meat really bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYep.\n\n I mean, metal flakes in your field.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWow.\n\n So when you buy ground beef at the grocery store, is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's what I'm saying?\n\n It's not good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, I've never had metal flakes in the grocery store, but I don't buy it because of the homogenization, but if you buy a home grinder from the store like those kitchen stores, they're all flaky metal.\n\n \r\nOne use It was like sparkles, I had Christmas decorations.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nIf someone developed a hand crank stainless steel, that would be okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt would never hold up?\n\n For some reason it doesn't hold up.\n\n If they did, they would be producing them.\n\n For some reason meat under high pressure is not easy to put through, and if you buy one, they're $3,000, if you buy a good one.\n\n So, if you want to spend $3,000, go ahead and get a good one.\n\n \r\nSo, any ground beef from the grocery stores.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIs not good.\n\n Not good.\n\n Unless you ask them to grind it only once and use the large holes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut they still use cleaners in their grinders and all that.\n\n I just don't trust it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey use ammonia and don't clean it out properly.\n\n A food processor is so easy to clean and, you just put your chunks in there just like they do, they'll cut it into big chunks when they put it into the meat grinders in the stores and you would have to do it too if you had your own grinder.\n\n  \r\nI just make mine long thin slices, and then I'd mine in my food processer, and three seconds you have ground meat.\n\n 10 seconds you have mince, pate.\n\n  \r\nSo, it's very quick and it's pretty easy to clean and you can make a big batch of that and put it in glass jars, tightly sealed and make it for a couple of days at a time.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Hernia \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've heard from even people on the diet, that the only way for a hernia to be cured is through surgery\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI agree.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou agree.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI've only known one person who is able to heal their hernia?\n\n I've known four people who've had hernias that over a three-year period, period on the diet did not heal them because they keep bursting out and pushing and tearing, and there's some kind of toxicity in the surrounding tissue that won't allow proper healing.\n\n  \r\nThere are ways that I would attempt to do it now, but I haven't had anybody with a hernia lately to be able to experiment with.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, people are having a surgery are complaining about that the surgery was a problem also that mesh that they put in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but see, they're not using the pork mesh.\n\n I've had two people use the pork mesh and it's been beautiful.\n\n They use actual pork flesh, as opposed to plastic mesh.\n\n \r\nThis is what they used to make sutures out of, cat gut.\n\n They make the mesh out of pig tissue, pig guts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt really affects it too, depending on what I eat.\n\n Sometimes when I eat beef, it causes a little bit of pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that's just because your body may be going in there to clean out some of that toxicity because of the high protein level.\n\n \r\nSo, you just need to know what particular toxin is there, and the only way I can tell that is by photographing the eyes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'd love to be a guineau pig if you wanna try stuff on me and document it before I anything before surgery, you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay?\n\n But you're gonna have to- I've tried for three years with people without- didn't get worse, didn't get better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCause I've heard that it gets too bad, you need major surgery.\n\n That's what I've heard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's true if you're on a normal diet, but on your, this diet, I haven't seen anybody get worse.\n\n It's just annoying.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, this has gotten worse over the last year.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, are you 100% on the diet eating properly at the proper times.\n\n \r\nOkay, I rest my case?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) High Meat Works \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI had a question about high meats\n\n Can you talk about those a little bit.\n\n I haven't been able to?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I talked about it pretty extensively in the recipe book, but it works.\n\n It takes people out of poor digestion, people who have poor digestion and depression.\n\n Usually brings people out pretty quickly.\n\n\r\nA lot of people that don't respond quickly enough on regular meat do very well with high meat.\n\n The reason that the high meat works isn't necessarily just because of the introduction of bacteria into the intestines that are missing bacteria.\n\n It's because the bacteria's predigested the molecules of protein in meats.\n\n\r\nSo, let's say normally in digestion, you're lacking couple hundred varieties of bacteria that normally break down the complex proteins and help form new proteins to be utilized in your body, doesn't happen.\n\n Eating the high meat helps that because the bacteria is already working on the meat, breaking it down.\n\n\r\nSo, when you're eating it, especially if it's in liquid form, it's already predigested, you can absorb it and utilize it instantly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Hydrogen Peroxide In Sparkling Water \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can do that, but let me tell you, if you use the carbonated mineral water to take a stain, remember that carbonated water is a natural peroxide\n\n It's going to take the color out of whatever it is.\n\n \r\nSo, even though it will get rid of blood stains and everything immediately, and other stains, you better rinse it out immediately because you will take the color out of your furniture and clothes and rugs and everything.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Lactose Intoleracne and Aajonus Milk Schedule \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt has to do with whether there is such a thing as lactose intolerance\n\n If so, how do you know you have it, and if you do have it know your regular diet, what can you use to replace it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n Lactose intolerance is a too broad a term for people who have allergies to milk because it usually is the casein that they're allergic to, but it's because it's cauterized, it's cooked, it's pasteurized.\n\n\r\nOut of all the people that I've seen, only about 2% of the people have an allergy to milk and that's because it's cold, they're drinking cold milk.\n\n So, what happens.\n\n They drink the cold milk, the stomach contracts, doesn't secrete the hydrochloric acid?\n\n By the time the stomach is relaxed, the milk is moved over into the duodenum and getting into the blood.\n\n\r\nSo, the lactate and the casein is not being digested.\n\n So, they have an allergy to these large molecules that are not digesting and getting into the blood.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow would you know and what would you replace it with in the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you start having stomach cramps or nausea very shortly after drinking it, within 20 minutes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about exhaustion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nExhaustion doesn't have anything to do with a milk intolerance?\n\n\r\nYou have to have cramps or nausea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you do, what would you replace it with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't replace it?\n\n\r\nYou just have your milk warm.\n\n It has to be out at least 8 to 10 hours.\n\n \r\nI leave mine out 24 hours minimum.\n\n \r\nWhat I do is I take 28 ounces of milk, I'll add 4 tablespoons of cream to it, and 2 tablespoons of honey and I blend the honey with some milk and then pour it in there, and then they add the cream to it and I shake it, and this is after the milk hits room temperature.\n\n \r\nSo 5, 8 hours after it's in a dark cupboard.\n\n Keep it out of the light because the light will turn it bitter.\n\n Whether it's unnatural light or natural light, turn it bitter.\n\n \r\nSo, you put into cupboard, let it get room temperature.\n\n Then I add my honey and cream, then I let it sit for 24 - 48 hours, till it becomes kefir, and then I put it in the refrigerator.\n\n \r\nThen you can drink it cold because it's already predigested.\n\n The casein and lactate's already broken down.\n\n \r\n24 to 48, until it starts getting thick in the refrigerator and then it's really pasty.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long does it keep in the refrigerator.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've had it up to two weeks in experiments and if it separates, you just shake it?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Liver Problem, What To Eat \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's a liver problem\n\n You gotta eat some lemon with your butter.\n\n Don't eat much cream for a while.\n\n Minimize the consumption of avocados, eat more pineapple.\n\n \r\nEating custard, pineapple with the coconut cream and all that other stuff.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIf you drink a lube formula, and you feel nauseous, should you not drink it or should just drink it anyway.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPut more honey in it?\n\n If you're getting nauseous from a lube formula, you put more honey in it so it doesn't cause nausea or eat some cheese with it.\n\n  \r\nBecause it can be one of two things; that the liver is having a problem digesting it.\n\n the liver's gonna start throwing off poisons into the stomach, that causes nausea.\n\n Cheese will absorb it.\n\n Honey can circumvent that by giving the liver lots of enzymes to be able to break down the fats properly, so it doesn't have to throw off all the toxicity into the stomach.\n\n Two ways to do it, or you can do both.\n\n Eat more honey and cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo you wanna make yourself throw up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it's good to throw up if you want to get rid of those poisons quickly, you can do it?\n\n \r\nBut you've lost a lot of butter, poor cows worked very hard to make it.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Lower Back Pain, Bath & Yoga \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo about three or four years ago, I started getting like, can I ask personal health questions\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, as long as it's something I can answer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI started getting a pain in my lower back right above the sacrum on the right side, and it also goes into the front, and it actually made me like numb and limp on the right side of my body, and it goes all the way up my spine and causes my shoulder to be like this and it kind of like starts there and goes up there, makes me kind of limp and stuff on my right side.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if it were kidney related, you'd turn a little gaunt, and your urine would probably be a little stronger and even burn.\n\n So, did those symptoms start at the same time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThen you've probably just got a pinched nerve.\n\n The vertebras sit on top of each other like this and there's gaps on either side.\n\n If they go out of place, they squeeze those nerves and that causes the information from the brain not to get to the kidney or back from the kidney and the intestines because it goes all around the organs from the spine, it goes back to the brain.\n\n So, if that transmission of information gets blocked going both ways, you've got some serious problem, even numbness and you're crippled.\n\n Paralyzing type reaction.\n\n  \r\nSo, in order to keep those aligned properly, you need to heat the system.\n\n \r\nIt's good to get into a hot bath that's at least 103°.\n\n Sit in there for a half hour - 45 minutes.\n\n Then get into the plow when you get out.\n\n Everybody know the yoga AND the plow.\n\n So, you get on your back and you bring your butt up into the air and put your knees down here or over your head, so your feet are touching the floor above your head?\n\n So ,you stretch the entire back and you wanna hold that position for as long as you can, but you don't want to do it until your back is relaxed enough from the hot bath.\n\n  \r\nThat way, when you stretch everything, it will stay loose.\n\n If you do it while you're cold and not relaxed, you're already tense and tight, and those vertebrates are being held out of place.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you put it back in place by doing the plow within a few movements, you're gonna go out again, cause it's gonna twist out cause those muscles are contracting and you're gonna pull it right back out.\n\n But if you've relaxed it, and then you get into the plow or go for a chiropractic adjustment when they pull you back out or you go into that stretch, everything gets stretched out and it goes back into its particular place and all the muscles will be relaxing and less out of place, until you get tense again or get cold.\n\n \r\nAnd that could be a day and a half, two days or five hours depend about how cold you get.\n\n Get cold again and go out of place, you're gonna have to put the hot water bottles along your back or get into the bath again.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Lymph Massage \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey tickle my whole body while I sleep, and let me tell you, when I wake from those I'm charged\n\n If I have a deep tissue massage, it's like I need to go sleep more, I need to eat, and I feel uncomfortable because you have all these toxins moving through your system and you may have caused a lot of damage.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do you tell them.\n\n You just say to do it lighter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I take their arm and I say, \"You treat my whole body this way\"?\n\n And they say, \"Everywhere\".\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nI say no! For massage, sleep?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo happy ending.\n\n \r\nMy happy ending is waking restfully?\n\n If I want sex, I'll do it another way.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Mad Cow Disease \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you know anything about mad cow disease\n\n Do you know anything about what would happen if someone ate those cows?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI ate mad cow meat?\n\n From 1993 to 1996, I went to Paris frequently and stayed a month at a time, about three months a year.\n\n On the last trip my girlfriend said, \"If you're not gonna marry me we're over\".\n\n So, we were over *laughs*.\n\n\r\nBut when I was there, I was eating meat out of Carrefour supermarket.\n\n On the flight home, I pick up a magazine and it said Carrefour supermarkets had been selling mad cow meat from England for that entire 3 years that I was eating it, and I wasn't affected   \r\nYou've got to eat the brain and nervous system and mainly that mad cow disease is coming from dewormers.\n\n The chemicals that are put along the spinal cord on the back of the animal.\n\n It's a dewormer and there's heavy metals and it goes in poisons the spinal cord, goes to the brain and makes mush of it.\n\n \r\nSo, if you're not eating the brain in spinal cord, you're really not going to get any kind of that metal poisoning, unless you're getting lots of vaccines.\n\n You're getting lots of vaccines, those could go to the brain and create the melting of the brain, which they would call, call CJG which is mad human disease.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Meat and Lub Forula For Weight Gain \n \n \n \n \n### (35) Night Terrors \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNight terrors and she takes capsule for them, and I wanna know what you know about night terrors\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNightmares occur to burn off hormones that are not burned off during daytime?\n\n Usually somebody who produces a lot of hormones for physical activity.\n\n So, if they're not exercising, you're gonna have nightmares or they're going be emotionally distraught and angry and bitter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're not nightmares, they're night terrors.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou wake up terrified, you know.\n\n What are night terrors?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're totally different.\n\n You wake up, there's no recollection of what happened and you wake up, you're awake, like some part of you is awake while you're asleep and you could do things, draw things and say things and you can't get out of it until you go back to sleep and then wake up again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSleep walking, like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, pretty much?\n\n Although, you don't really move around that much.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI know a little bit about them.\n\n They usually are to do with trauma that's been unresolved in some way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut if you have any kind of neurological problem, brain malfunction, it's a lack of protein, and you should be combining all three kinds of meats to help the brain.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) No Fruit Juice \n \n \n \n \n### (37) Ocean, No Lake Or River Fish \n \n**[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou said that you could eat any kind of fish that was raw, but I'm not sure-  \r\n\n\r\nI didn't say any kind\n\n I said wild ocean caught fish.\n\n No lake caught, no river caught, unless you know the river is up on top ofthe Colorado mountains and isn't.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Organic Pastures \n \n \n \n \n### (39) Peel Cucubmer For Erection \n \n \n \n \n### (40) Pineapple Everyday Okay For Athletes \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHalf a pineapple a day for what\n\n Four days in a row?\n\n He was a basket case.\n\n\r\nFor me, If I had probably a cup a day every day for six days, it would be a problem.\n\n \r\nWell, I like people to go to somebody who has experience and is aware of it.\n\n He's the man to talk to.\n\n \r\nYou have to be careful about that.\n\n\r\nThat's why in the book you can have a pineapple mixture every other day, maybe every third day, but don't have it every day, unless you're an athlete.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Pineappleto Break Down Uric Acid \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMay need more pineapple more regularly to get rid of the uric acid and lactic acid filled up from exercise\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Preservatives and Colors Are Heavy Metals \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen I went raw, I noticed that if I did get blood on anything, it would wash out like that with no\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you don't have all that sticky garbage from cooked diets.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, before a lot of it is that blood stains so much cause of being on a cooked diet \r\n\n\r\nYeah, and preservatives and colorings and food colorings and all of that\r\nThose are heavy metals so that causes dying.\n\n Not just death dying, but color dying.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nGerolsteinerr mineral water could possibly take the color out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right?\n\n Just look at my couch in there.\n\n I got three spots where I put it on and didn't wash it down right away.\n\n Took the stain out immediately, also took the color with it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Ridges Are Heavy Metals Also Dandruff \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRidges in the nails are usually heavy metals being built into the nails\n\n\r\nWhen you've got heavy metals running in the blood or in the system anywhere, they have a tendency to magnetize other metals.\n\n So, when it builds into the nails, it's too large of a structure, too large of a unit, so it creates these ridges, the body built it out \r\nIt's one way the body gets rid of it, builds it into the nails to get it out.\n\n It also does it into the hair.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Side Pain On Foot \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanna know, because I have a side pain in my foot right here\n\n It comes and goes.\n\n It's like a bee sting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFeels like a bee string, burns.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot burns, but like a sharp goes in and out like a-\r\n\n\r\nStabs?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSharp stabs or dull stabs.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSharp stabs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSharp stabs, that sounds like crystals.\n\n\r\nSome kind of margarine or vegetable oil crystallized in your foot.\n\n So, just put some coconut cream on your foot and coconut oil and let it help dissolve it from the outside in.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nTwice a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can do it twice a day?\n\n It does take a long time to dissolve.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Storing Vegetables \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nConcerned that we're gonna be there year-round and they have a long winter, so we're not sure what we're gonna do for vegetables\n\n We're gonna try and put a green house in, but growing our own celery is gonna look like a field of celery.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you can make a lot of cucumbers.\n\n You just need a cold cellar.\n\n \r\nAt my grandparents farm we kept everything fresh in a cold celler and I mean it was a basement that was rock and concrete and it was wet and cold down there.\n\n And they kept cucumbers in gallon jars, and they were hardly shriveled at all as long as you didn't open them.\n\n \r\nOf course, they made pickles and all kinds of things for the winter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, whatever the temperature is at that point will keep year-round basically.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBasically, yeah.\n\n When you're 10 feet below the earth, it pretty much stays the same temperature, which is about 60° and lower.\n\n 58° to 60°.\n\n  \r\nEven if it freezes above, it won't freeze in the cold cellar, unless you have a vent that allows even colder air to come in because you want it to get colder.\n\n If it isn't cold enough, then you just run a vent down there, a concrete vent that has a cover on it, doesn't get wet.\n\n  \r\nIt also has to be above the ground, so if it floods the water, won't go down into your basement.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Strict Primal Dieters \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n50 people that I knew would do it strictly\n\n They wouldn't do anything else because even with the Paul Cohen who was a champion tennis player years ago, Olympics, and was McEnroe's coach for 10 years, he's 100% or he won't do anything else because now he's in his late sixties and he needs all the direction and energy you can get.\n\n\r\nSo, he does it by the letter, by the amount, the times of the day, everything exactly, and one year he fought with me, got skinny and he decided to do everything differently, and he was so off balance that year, his income went down, everything went down.\n\n So, a year later he was coming back and apologizing.\n\n\r\nNow he's a 100%  on the diet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Swamp Water Okay \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOr a swamp or anything like that, the worst thing that's gonna happen if you drink swamp water is you're gonna get some diarrhea or some vomit\n\n \r\nIf you're in Mississippi, that's different.\n\n You've got all kinds of chemicals that are swimming around from paint stores and gasoline, fuel tanks and everything are polluting the water.\n\n\r\nSo, that water's pretty poisonous.\n\n But in Asia with the Tsunami, the water wasn't contaminated and they were going over there giving injections and everything else.\n\n And then Mississippi, did you see their photographs where they were decontaminating people.\n\n They're spraying these people with this white foam stuff, which was mainly ammonia.\n\n They were decontaminating them, poisoning them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Test From Tesicles \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf you're eating bulls' balls, you're getting good testosterone that way\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nEating what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's Buffalo testicles?\n\n \r\nThere are a couple very horny guys.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nMore than half of them are women that take them.\n\n**[Attendees],[James]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nEither they're using them for themselves or for their mate.\n\n \r\nI have been cashiering and more than half This last Wednesday were bought by women.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo kidding.\n\n Tell them buy cucumbers with them.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Tinitis Heavy Metals \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've seen people with tinnitus who have a metal ridge that takes up a large part of their mouth, causes tinnitus in the ear where the metal is\n\n \r\nBut most often it's cause a lot of metals are detoxing from the brain.\n\n Just remember that neurological transmission of light and information is transmitted off of metallic minerals.\n\n So, most of the heavy metals go to the brain, and because you cooked your food, people have cooked their food, almost all of them are fractionated from their normal combination of nutrients.\n\n  \r\nSo, there's a lot of people like Sally Fallon and a lot of chemists that say, you've gotta release those molecules to be able to utilize them.\n\n That is absolute hog wash.\n\n They're poisonous once they're isolated, they're not properly utilized.\n\n \r\nIf you've got a mineral, you shouldn't have just H2O connected with it or let's say a potassium molecule.\n\n There should be about 12 - 13 combinations with one molecule of one mineral.\n\n There should be a whole unit because when they're isolated, they are earth.\n\n It is a rock.\n\n It is not a complete biological substance.\n\n \r\nWhen the brain detoxifies, it detoxifies out the ears, the tear, ducts, the sinuses, the gums mainly, mostly it's the gums and the tongue.\n\n  \r\nThat's why people get plaque all over their teeth cause the body's dumping all those cauterized minerals out the teeth, out the gums and they take on the teeth.\n\n If the heavier metals go out the ears, they'll cause tinnitus.\n\n \r\nYou've gotta eat berries.\n\n It depends on if it's light metals or heavy metals that're causing- it could be iodine.\n\n Lots of iodine with a little lead that can cause that kinda ringing.\n\n  \r\nIf you really want to get clean it out, you gotta add berries.\n\n Combination of raspberries with some dark berries, coconut cream, a little butter and a little raw cream, and honey, \r\nIf you can't get them organic in season, you can always get the organic, frozen berries for that combination, and it's not something that goes away easily because heavy metals, itcould take a thousand fat molecules to get rid of one molecule of mercury, and if you got ringing, you've got quite a metal build up there.\n\n \r\nIt's causing you to receive radio wave, and other waves that are causing that ringing.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Toenail&finger Fungus, Antiobitcs, Bacteria, Mold \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nShe asked, why do people get toenail and fingernail fungus\n\n You get a fungi mainly because of antibiotics storing the joints?\n\n  \r\nAnd just remember that antibiotics are made from molds they're molds, from wheat or some kind of grain, and they inject it into you, sterilize them when they inject them into you.\n\n \r\nSo, it creates a mold that eats other bacteria molds, mainly what the vaccines and the antibiotics do is they poison the digestive tract and the bloodstream and neurological serum.\n\n They poison them and they cause the destruction of many cells.\n\n  \r\nSo, it doesn't really stop and improve health.\n\n What it does is it contaminates the body so badly that the body can no longer focus on what it was detoxifying.\n\n Whether you have bacteria, parasites or a fungi, or a virus cleaning your system.\n\n It's poisoning and a mass contamination that it causes directly in the serums and in the intestinal tract that stops the normal detoxification that was being carried on.\n\n \r\nSo, there's never any progress toward better health from those things, there's just more contamination.\n\n When you get the fungus in the nails, whether it's toe or feet, or even fungus in the scalp cause it often happens around hair; in men it could be chest or back, butt.\n\n  \r\nThose fungi are mainly from antibiotics.\n\n They become reactive again, the molds have created sub molds to help break it down.\n\n Now, bacteria, parasites, fungi are all in nature to decompose waste products, reduce them into a substance that could be recycled.\n\n So, what do we use as fertilizer.\n\n We use excrement, we use secretion, urine?\n\n You know, the nitrogen that we put in the fields, which these big corporations put in fields.\n\n \r\nWhat they've done is they have these huge dairy companies that take urine from the runoff of urine from the cattle, they purify it and then go stick it out into the fields and pump it into the fields after they chemically process it.\n\n So, it's got this ammonia and nitrogen in it.\n\n And whats the other thing we use.\n\n Feces?\n\n \r\nAll part of nature to recycle, to fertilize.\n\n Same thing occurs in our bodies, the bacteria, parasites and the fungi have waste products.\n\n Well, what they've done is taken a mass amount of food and they break it down into a small substance.\n\n  \r\nParasite can eat a 100x its weight for about 20 hours, and reduce that amount into pieces that equal about 1%.\n\n So, it's like eating a 100 pounds of food and having a 1 pound shit the next day, 20 hours later.\n\n That's efficiency.\n\n  \r\nWhen you have virus working in your body, you don't have a reduction.\n\n You have more of a contamination.\n\n  \r\nBacteria can eat 50x their weight in the same amount of time and eliminate 3% to a 5% in a 20-hour period.\n\n \r\nFungi is a little different.\n\n Fungi is like a cross between a virus and a bacteria.\n\n There's a serum.\n\n They go, they mainly propagate on a mycelium.\n\n It's a liquid substance, which goes in and dissolves.\n\n**[unclear]**\n looking substances on it or liquidity white.\n\n That's the mycelium, the mushroom is the fruit of that, which creates the spore, so it could be thrown around when the rain comes and they wash into the earth.\n\n If they find dead roots, mycelium goes to work.\n\n  \r\nThat's the way the bacteria and parasites work in us and fungi.\n\n When they find something degenerative, they go to work.\n\n That's their job.\n\n It's just like the crows and the vultures when they find a dead carcas, they eat it.\n\n They consume all this massive stinky, smelly stuff, and reduce it to a small amount of fecal matter, which becomes fertilizer.\n\n \r\nWe want parasites, we want bacteria, we want fungi to do their work, to reduce this contamination.\n\n We get well faster.\n\n Virus, we get well very slowly and a lot of people will die from it, from viruses.\n\n And there's no antibiotic that works with a virus because antibiotics are the poison that kill bacteria, parasites and fungus.\n\n \r\nThey don't work on non-living substances like a virus.\n\n The virus is just a protein body.\n\n You spike a petri dish with virus, there is no multiplication of virus.\n\n It's all the same amount.\n\n If you put live cells in there, all of a sudden more virus will start appearing.\n\n Why.\n\n Because the virus is created by the cells intercellularly?\n\n  \r\nWhy are there 200,000 viruses.\n\n Because when a cell has to make soaps to clean itself, it's not gonna make a soap to clean everything?\n\n How many solvents do we have to clean different kinds of dirt, different kinds of particle, different kinds of oil.\n\n A cell has to make a particular virus to clean a particular part of the internal structure or the epidermal structure of the cell itself.\n\n \r\nSo, it's a very finite process, and there's no way that any human is smart enough to create a good balance to know what the human body or an animal cell is doing.\n\n So, the whole idea that we can balance and counterbalance whatever we do is a myth.\n\n  \r\nBut people have an inflated idea of what their abilities are and capabilities because it takes a live structure and all the internal life within the structure to do it.\n\n Oh, we have 60 trillion cells in our body.\n\n Each one is part of the whole structure and takes care of us and itself.\n\n And inside that cellular structure, you have 60 trillion micro life forms also making up that one cell.\n\n \r\nSo, it's infinite.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Toxins Go In Bone Marrow, Hands, and Feet \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe fungus is an important part of breaking down toxic substances, but they mainly come from antibiotics, and most of those antibiotics store in the hands, feet, joints, and the bone marrow\n\n  \r\nSo, let's say it starts causing some deterioration in the cartilage or in the bone or the bone marrow.\n\n \r\nThe body throws it off and where's it throw it off.\n\n \r\nBuilds it into the nails and out the cuticles?\n\n  \r\nHe had fungus all over and cracking.\n\n \r\nGangrene is a fungus.\n\n \r\nAnd in the book, I talk about when I'm talking with my son, we're working and that mold’s coming out of my tongue.\n\n What I found out it was penicillin coming out and I hadn't had penicillin for 20 years before that point.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Tribes & Bacteria, Companies Pay To Poison Them \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA lot of the epidemics in Hawaii and with the American Indians, they said, \"Oh, there were viruses they couldn't handle\"\n\n These Indians were wiping their butts without washing their hands just like all these primitive tribes, eating raw meat without cleaning it right out of the Buffalo.\n\n They were walking through horse shit all the time, dealing with horses and their tails fly all over and hit the flies and get E coli all over the place.\n\n\r\nTo think, to believe that these American Indians and the Hawaiians and all these indigenous tribes were dying because of some particular white man's disease, it's absolutely absurd.\n\n \r\nIf you look at some of the proper documentation, like if you read, I forgot the author's name, but he wrote savages and he talked about how the German, and British diamond mining companies, Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola would hire Brazilians in bars, arm them with automatic weapons and poison and go around and slaughter the natives.\n\n \r\nAnd if you put these particular poisons in their water hole, it looks like they got smallpox.\n\n A lot of your diseases will look like smallpox or measles.\n\n A lot of your poisons will look like that.\n\n \r\nSo, of course the thing is, \"Oh, they got some kind of bacterial infection and disease\".\n\n No, they were poisoned.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Unfrozen Meat and Butter \n \n \n \n \n### (54) Vacuum Packing Meat \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nStarting the diet here and trying to stock up on meat and stuff\n\n What's the deal about vacuum packing meat.\n\n Is that gonna be an issue to try and and extend?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it will extend the freshness?\n\n I put all mine in glass jars.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRight, I noticed that.\n\n That's why I'm asking the question.\n\n \r\nIs there a problem to vacuum pack it in the food standard plastic bags.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the problem with your plastic bags is that they all have a powdery film that they use in manufacturing, so the plastic doesn't stick together.\n\n It's petroleum-based chemical.\n\n So, if you wash the plastic before you heat seal it, vacuum pack it.\n\n That's fine.\n\n \r\nBut I wouldn't, unless you're going to take the meat out and wash it.\n\n Rinse it off with good cold water before you cut into it and utilize it.\n\n So, you do one or the other.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nYou are correct on that stuff.\n\n I had a food saver and I had the material.\n\n That material is very different from Ziploc bags.\n\n \r\nThat materials got a powdery film on all of it, because that's where they use it.\n\n They don't know where you're going to heat seal it.\n\n So, they cover the whole entire thing from one end of the roll of the other with that stuff.\n\n A little simple.\n\n What I learned iis and Aajonus knows this because for years at the beginning, when we were doing meat, we'd go to whole foods and buy meat within two or three days, it was already starting to go awfully smelly.\n\n \r\nThe reason why we found out mostly is because it's exposed to the air and the oxygen all day.\n\n So, when we cut up meat, we cut it up and undo it from the vacuum pack package that we have and put it immediately into a Ziploc bag and it lasts for 7 to 10 days without going off.\n\n \r\nBut you can do even better as he says, take it from there and put it into glass.\n\n It won't break down at all that way.\n\n No oxygen, no breakdown.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause if you pack it like that, the fat doesn't turn brown.\n\n If you, you leave it in the plastic seal bags, the fat will turn brown within three days, four days.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nIt starts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBy the, fifth, sixth day.\n\n It's brown.\n\n Not as tasty.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Vegetarian Lymph Congestion \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou were vegetarian for most of your life and vegetable oils in the human body harden, they crystallize because we don't have a high enough body temperature\n\n \r\nHerbivores have a body temperature, 100° to 101.\n\n6°.\n\n They run around with a fever, for us that would be a fever.\n\n Ours is 98.\n\n6° approximately.\n\n \r\nVegetable oils that are in the cellular structure or in whatever structure of our bodies over a 10 - 15 - 20-year period, crystallize and harden.\n\n That's what causes hardening of the heart and the arteries, not animal fats.\n\n Even if animal fats are cooked, there's no evidence of hardening of the heart or the arteries because the tribes that eat only cooked meat eat nothing else, but cooked meat and animal fats have no hardening of the arteries, and no heart disease.\n\n  \r\nOnly our society has high relationship to that, and it's mostly in people, including MS, people who have multiple sclerosis is a high vegetable oil diet, margarine, safflower oil, any of the pressed oils, except for olive oil.\n\n They start crystallizing and hardening at our body temperature over many years if our body is structured with them.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you're putting pressure on points where you already have dryness of circulation, whether it's lymphatic circulation or neurological circulation or blood circulation, you're going to cause breaking and cracking.\n\n  \r\nBut all you have to do is touch.\n\n Touch, that's it.\n\n Barely put your hand on a spine and you have the electromagnetic energy flow through to those centers.\n\n There's no pressing necessary.\n\n That's the best way to do it.\n\n  \r\nI mean, there's a lot of numb people out there, like to feel something.\n\n I remember when I was an actor, my publicity agent was the head of MGMs publicity department.\n\n When he reached 75, he cut his hand really badly one time and I wanted to help him stop the pain and everything.\n\n \r\nHe says, \"No, it's a sensation\".\n\n  \r\nI had to really stop and think about that.\n\n You know, what the hell did he mean it's a sensation.\n\n Do you get that numb when you're 75, 72 years old, that any kind of sensation is embraced?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nMassages are not good, really?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEspecially if they're gonna break tissue in your body?\n\n \r\nWhenever I go to Thailand, I usually have three massages a day, two hours each, and I only sleep at those times.\n\n So, I have one in the morning from about 9AM to 11AM.\n\n So that's a two hour sleep period for me, and the first one will be with the coconut oil.\n\n \r\nIt's gently rubbed into my skin.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Well Water \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, if that's well water, would we need a filter on the house water that's coming in for bathing\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't have any filter on mine, and I've got all those clusters of minerals all around my faucets?\n\n So, if you don't want that, you're gonna have to filter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it's not bad for you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're not using chemical filters?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe minerals that you have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's just that you're going go through fixtures about every 10 years?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the two things we're doing locally is that the behind contact in the water and they soften the water, which I'm assuming is salt processed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n They usually use potassium chloride, which is saltpeter.\n\n  \r\nSo, you might have a limp dick if you drink your water or don't use it at all.\n\n \r\nWhen I moved into here, I saw the bags of saltpeter, and I said, \"You're not filtering my water that way\".\n\n So, I, re-piped the whole thing and did it myself.\n\n So, I'm right out of the well into the house.\n\n \r\nThe toilet jammed because of the crystallization, so the water wasn't flowing anymore, except for the water just right down into the drain itself.\n\n So, I just had to have the toilet replaced.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does that potassium chloride do to you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose salts make heavier salts that base them into smaller molecules, so it doesn't dry out things?\n\n So, it doesn't make your clothes stiff and all of that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but like, is it toxic for your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yes?\n\n Very toxic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Where To Get Fluids \n \n \n \n \n### (58) Yoga & Longevity \n \n**[2005],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy question, uh, is the broad subject of longevity and re-youthing\n\n \r\nIn yoga, they talk about a number of ways of approaching this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet me attack that.\n\n You're gonna break this down into the stages.\n\n I'm gonna take one stage at a time.\n\n The Yogi shit is all bullshit.\n\n I've lived with seven masters and none of them lived anywhere beyond 80 years old, most of 'em didn't live that long.\n\n \r\nThey all had ill health.\n\n So, they can't even talk about longevity because these people lived in meditation.\n\n They lived in all kinds of transcendental states and they didn't improve their lives, they may have improved their lives, but they certainly didn't live without disease and they didn't live longer than anybody else.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nSo, all the talk about meditating to induce improve the pineal gland for purposes of,  regeneration is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll complete bullshit?\n\n In the vernacular anyway.\n\n I'm not saying that if you weren't on raw foods that your body would not be feeding the pineal gland, and the pituitary gland properly would extend your life.\n\n \r\nThere are hormones that the body can produce.\n\n Growth hormones are a part of the pituitary gland and if you can continue growth hormones, you can continue your life and live longer.\n\n \r\nMentally, psychologically, I have not seen any evidence of proof of that, even though it's written in all these yoga books and all these transcendental meditation books, it's all horseshit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Zinc In Zuchini \n \n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Adrenaline \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, why is adrenaline important\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the body uses adrenaline in emergencies many times?\n\n \r\nThis is something that I cannot laboratory prove.\n\n However, by experience, I've seen that people who have high adrenaline, produce a lot of adrenaline in the blood seem to be able to drink smoke, do everything bad and get away with it.\n\n \r\nSo, there's some properties about adrenaline that keep people numb to what they're doing, and also it keeps them from getting too ill.\n\n Now, still a lot of those people will all of a sudden to drop a hat die of a heart attack because the adrenaline dries their system out.\n\n So, they get brittle.\n\n All of a sudden they'll go like that.\n\n They'll completely healthy.\n\n Nobody has a clue that they have anything wrong with them.\n\n Then they'll have an aneurysm in the brain or a heart attack, and that's it.\n\n Because adrenaline dries the system.\n\n \r\nUnless they eat a tremendous amount of fat.\n\n Now you take somebody who, who has high adrenaline and eats a high amount of fat at the same time.\n\n Then they won't have that problem.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aids &  HIV \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe other thing was about the aids that you were talking about\n\n I heard a gentleman that I very much respect to say that it's actually a genetic precursor that can be balanced.\n\n Citing a lot of cases that HIV is not present with aids and HIV patients sometimes never get aids no matter whether.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n HIV is just, it's a breakdown of the immune system.\n\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with a virus.\n\n Aids is a virus.\n\n HIV is a lowered immunity, your breakdown of your lymph system, basically almost total breakdown of your lymph system.\n\n And some people will get all kinds of diseases for that Guillain Barre, you know, any number of diseases that can-\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Bad Butter \n \n \n \n \n### (4) Biotin \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm going to ask one question, I've read that raw eggs will deplete the biotin in your system\n\n That's one of the B-vitamins.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn my book, there's a misprint.\n\n There was a spellcheck that went through and changed avidin to albumin.\n\n So, it's the avidin that binds with the biotin and that only happens in a chemistry lab.\n\n It doesn't happen in the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying raw eggs don't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they do not?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, what you're saying the people who are saying that are saying it because of the laboratory-\r\n\n\r\nIt happens in the laboratory, but it doesn't happen in the human body.\n\n You use a lot of biotin in the process of changing over biocarbon's in the body.\n\n\r\nSo, when you get raw eggs, you're going to use that biotin- you're going to find avidin present within that complex, but it's not a deprivation, it's a utilization to transfer biocarbon's.\n\n And I mentioned that in the book, just remember when you get to that part that talks about albumin, it's supposed to be avidin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Cancer Patients \n \n \n \n \n### (6) Cheese As A Snack \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIs it okay to just eat plain cheese as a snack\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you don't have constipation, that's fine?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'm on the program.\n\n So, it's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUsually, I will always eat cheese with something to break the hunger like some honey or some butter or some milk with it?\n\n \r\nIf you have a tendency towards constipation, you don't want to eat cheese.\n\n If you're one of those people who do does beautifully with cheese, and it doesn't constipate you it's fine.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Chicken Fish & Beef Everyday \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow much olive oil do you put in your meat every day\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo with four meals, I'll have two tablespoons of olive oil, or maybe I'll have four tablespoons with one meat meal?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been putting in 2-3 tablespoons a day, one tablespoon at or time with my chicken or my beef.\n\n I take one tablespoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, one tablespoons.\n\n That's alright.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's two tablespoons a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's fine, but I'd have them at one meal, so you're not making solvents to do all that so much.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cirrhosis \n \n**[2000],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCan you talk a little bit about cirrhosis, treatment and causes and-\r\n\n\r\nWell, I didn't want to get into anything specific, any specific disease like that to a great extent, but cirrhosis, like I said in the book is basically the inability to reproduce cells to heal properly\n\n \r\nIt can have been from too many x-rays, too many pollutants in the body, chemicals, anything that destroys the body's ability to reproduce cells, to build new cells in it.\n\n\r\nOr the body can call out cells from other areas and deliver them to that area as scar tissue, as live cells, like an endometriosis.\n\n\r\nThose people who have liver spots.\n\n Those are actually liver cells on the skin.\n\n The liver no longer utilizes them anymore because they're not functioning properly as a liver, but they will still function as a cell somewhere else in the body.\n\n So, they'll act as a skin, so the body can send them there.\n\n If your body can no longer have those particular hormones to call out cells out of other areas to go to that area and repair that one spot, you've got a problem with cirrhosis.\n\n\r\nInability to heal wounds and it may be because a concentration of contamination is in that general area or the faulty ability of the lack of hormones to call out those cells.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Clabbered Milk & Kefir \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI've been experimenting with it for years\n\n  If you take the milk and you take about 3/4 of a cup out, 6 ounces out of the Claravale, you can do it in the Claravale bottle.\n\n However, poor Ron has to go there with a bristle brush, and clean out each bottle.\n\n\r\nRight.\n\n So it's better to put it in one that you can get in and clean it easier.\n\n So, get those quart jars with the regular mouth on it, and then pour about most of the quart into it and let it sit for three days.\n\n I think he said it took him two days or 8 hours less than the three days in his room temperature to get it to clabber to the point where it looked like yogurt.\n\n\r\nIf it's raw, it will actually look like yogurt.\n\n If you let it go longer, then the water will completely separate, and then you're going to have curdled milk, which can make cottage cheese with it.\n\n But the point is they have it at the point where it clabbers.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes it have the acidophilus, and all that in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, the bacteria that's more important is?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n acidophilus is not natural.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, all of those are created to help digest the proteins, the sugars, and the fats.\n\n So, each one of those will break down one of the substances, the milk naturally has those substances already in them.\n\n\r\nSo, if you let them work on the milk before you ingest them, you will infuse them into you to help you generate your own.\n\n If you take acidophilus supplements, bulgaricus into the kefirs, it will not help you regenerate your own.\n\n It will just predigest it for you, so you can get the value of the milk, but still will not break it down into the most appropriate molecular disassemblement that is for you, the individual.\n\n You let the milk do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you make your own kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just let the raw milk to sit in room temperature?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou can get it overnight.\n\n If you sit it on the top of the stove if you happen to have a pilot light.\n\n Take a little bit off so that the top doesn't pop cause as it starts to ferment.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you cover it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I cover it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI don't cover mine.\n\n I just put something on it, so the dust doesn't enter it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, stir it up, so it looks like a thick.\n\n Do you have a pilot light?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I don't, I leave it at room temperature, it takes longer?\n\n The reason I don't like to put it on top of the fridge.\n\n The reason I don't like to put it on top of the fridge is cuz the EMFS that come off the fridge are phenomenal.\n\n They're being broadcast like three feet.\n\n\r\nEMFS change the RNA and DNA structure in the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n So, you shake it or you just eat it all by itself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Yeah, but if you put it in larger, you can spoon it out and enjoy spooning?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust in between meals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Right.\n\n Or with meals, it's fine.\n\n As long as it's not with vegetable juice.\n\n \r\nThe only thing that you could mix with vegetable juice is coconut cream and raw cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut this clabbered milk can be eaten with meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Detox \n \n**[2000],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, the best thing to do if you have a problem, if you have a detox, don't panic\n\n On this diet I've found that you get you just have to be patient.\n\n Of course, those's people who've had tremendous radiation, chemo, and surgeries, and you have cancer, something like that.\n\n You may not make it, but like I always say it's probably better to die than to keep having the quality of your life reduced to the point where you're like I was where I could not stand up.\n\n I mean, I would basically pass out if I tried to stand up, so what I'd do is I sleep on the couch.\n\n When I had to go off the couch, I would roll onto the floor and crawl with my elbows all around the house.\n\n That's what the medical profession did to me.\n\n \r\nSo, basically, I'd rather not go with them.\n\n I'd rather die than to go through that again, cause it took me a lot longer to get well than it would have from the cancer.\n\n This time I was going through it again, and this was because of the radiation therapy that I was crawling around the room.\n\n I had spinal meningitis again.\n\n \r\nSpinal meningitis was nothing of what I had before they treated me and the radioactivity in my spine damaged my spine to do that.\n\n So anyway, in this last three weeks, it's the hardest detox that I've been through in about probably 10 years, and it was a rough one, but I'm standing up here today.\n\n \r\nI don't think that I can get very far down yet, just below my knees.\n\n It'll take about 4 and a half months to clean that up and to detox and get strong again where I'll be able to touch four.\n\n What I'm hoping for this time is my hamstrings have been so tight for so many years.\n\n I can't sit, you know, and touch my toes without bending my knees.\n\n \r\nSo, I'm hoping that when I get completely well from this one in about 4 - 6 months, that I'll have that flexibility, and that's usually what happens.\n\n I get more flexible and better every time I go through anything.\n\n I'm also hoping that spot that was on the spine will all be removed and it may light, or it may shrink, which means I may have to go through it again, but it won't know for about 4 more months.\n\n \r\nSo, people who go through heavy detoxifications, I know Melanie there was going to go through spinal meningitis once and the medical profession took care of her and stopped it cause they thought she'd be paralyzed and die or something like that, which is, the process if you have medical treatment, you can go into anaphylactic shock.\n\n \r\nNow, I know that I've mentioned this before, I'm jumping around because I want to get to your questions, but I wanted to make this as quickly as possible.\n\n I know that I've said this before, but there's some new people here.\n\n  \r\nA lot of people are concerned about the bacteria, the parasites and all the deaths that have occurred because of bacterial food poisoning.\n\n All of the medical reports that I've seen, the death certificates that I've seen of the people who died of so-called bacterial food poisoning like with the Jack In The Box incident, none of them died of bleeding to death or dehydration, which happens when you have an intense detoxification with bacteria or parasites, and the body's trying to flush it out.\n\n People vomit to the point where they bleed, or they have diarrhea to the point where they bleed and they dehydrate from all of that, as well as losing the blood.\n\n \r\nThese are the only things, blood loss and dehydration is the only thing that can naturally occur and can kill you and it happens 1 in probably10,000.\n\n All of those records that I've seen, every one of 'em died from anaphylactic shock, which means from the treatment of the diarrhea and all of that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWere those kids.\n\n Did you mean small kids?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEven the adults, they're dying from anaphylactic shock?\n\n \r\nSo, it's the treatment.\n\n The doctors are not gonna say, \"Ah, I'm sorry, you died because of our drugs\".\n\n They're not gonna even say that, they're going to continue to blame the bacteria and parasites.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, are you saying the kids would've survived had no treatment been given.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, as long as they were given good food and they didn't dehydrate?\n\n There's still a certain percentage of the children who would dehydrate and die.\n\n \r\nEspecially if the children were raised on high carbohydrate diets.\n\n They have all these advanced glycation end products that built up in their body on which the bacteria or parasites can feed, and it causes a tremendous detoxification and that is either the salmonella, E.\n\n coli or the campylobacter are working on that toxicity to remove it.\n\n \r\nAnd when they start having vomiting or diarrhea, that's the body dumping it quickly.\n\n If it doesn't flush it out, it burns the tissues like acid.\n\n So, that's why it has to flush it out in vomit.\n\n Now if people are on such a bad diet, like in third world countries where they're fed cereals, and grains basically, cooked grains.\n\n \r\nA lot of those people are going to die from dehydration and bleeding to death because they don't have any good stable proteins.\n\n There's no way for the body to recover from that.\n\n \r\nBut here in America with our meats, even though they're cooked will be more stable and they'll be less deaths from that.\n\n \r\nBut when the medical profession gets involved, then the rate of deaths are like a 100x greater.\n\n \r\nJust like people have automatic anaphylactic shock from vaccines, whether they're flu or whatever.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou're saying that someone that is on a raw food's diet is less susceptible to being harmed by bacteria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes.\n\n  \r\nWell, the bacteria never harms you.\n\n The bacteria is there to eat degenerative tissue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, it only harms you when it's involved with whatever bad stuff is in people's bodies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that's all that ever goes after?\n\n Bad stuff, degenerative tissue in the body.\n\n So, the bacteria's never a bad guy.\n\n It's just, if you are so full of toxicity that the detoxification is going kill you.\n\n \r\nThen it's a problem for you, but it's gonna be a problem for you if you're living in that state anyway.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Does Aajonus Drink Fresh Milk \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you recommend the clabbered milk all the time\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't digest it well when it's fresh, so I do it all the time, and when I drink it because I haven't bought enough to keep it going, and I drink it fresh?\n\n I drink more, a lot more of it and I dehydrate easier.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThat's why I'm so dry from the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou could be.\n\n Yeah.\n\n So, if you let it clabber, doesn't happen as much.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat do you mean by keep it going.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt takes three days for me to get it to the clabber point \r\n\n \r\nDo you refrigerate it after it's ready?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n If you're not gonna drink at all.\n\n You see, I stagger it.\n\n I take two out a day, as I drink two, I'll use two.\n\n \r\nI put two more out to start.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNow, why'd you say 3/4 of a cup of milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI said take out 3/4 of a cup so that you've got a jar with some air in it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Dry Skin \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about sexually transmitted things\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid you read my book?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Remember I talked about Byron in there who was with the woman with syphilis.\n\n She was in stage 3, he didn't get it.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo you think that people that get aids and die of it are susceptible to it because-\r\n\n\r\nNo, from what I've read, they were injected with it.\n\n\r\nIf they're passing needles and stuff like that, then they're probably getting it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut if their environment's clean enough, maybe they can get it from the needle, and they can resist it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, very possible.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut what about where gay men interact with other gay men, then have it, and one of their partners would get it, and the other guy doesn't, like what-\r\n\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Since I worked with quite a few of them for a long while.\n\n Everyone that I questioned had the hepatitis vaccine, and sometimes it took 15 to 20 years for it to come out on them.\n\n But everyone was blaming the partner.\n\n\r\nWell, I didn't have aids before I got together with him.\n\n And I said, did you ever have the hepatitis vaccine.\n\n Every one of 'em had had it, and those who hadn't had the hepatitis vaccine had been shooting up and changing needles with people who had?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow many aids people did you work with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbout 27?\n\n\r\nBut let me tell you, they have those people so scared.\n\n It's ridiculous.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDid you have success.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Very good.\n\n \r\nBut it's a long process because you have to understand that when somebody has got aids and HIV, well, basically when you've got hepatitis to go get the hepatitis vaccine in the first place, you've traumatized your body to the point where your liver is not functioning properly.\n\n\r\nSo, recovering takes a very long time.\n\n You have to get the liver and it takes 2.\n\n5 years to get the liver well enough to get the body regenerating.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut if you're saying, if you have the vaccine, so it's gonna take 2.\n\n5 years, even on the raw foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt could take 12, 15 years for them to recover from all the problems?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey probably get a lot of medical.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Oh yeah.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Endometriosis \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYes Melanie\n\n**[Melanie]**\n\r\nAt one time I was told I had endometriosis and this man that I was dealing with who was going to help me out, it wasn't a doctor, it was more like holistic route.\n\n And he said that I had parasites.\n\n That's what was giving me the endometriosis, and we had to get rid of them and he gave me black walnut tincture and all these different things that made my head spin.\n\n And it was really unbelievable for about a month I had to do this every day, and so he got rid of all my parasites.\n\n So, that means that I tend to get them.\n\n I saw them come out.\n\n Can I get them back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you did natural means to get rid of them?\n\n\r\nSo, it means you'll get 'em back as soon as you get those fluids, those serums out of your system.\n\n**[Melanie]**\n\r\nWell, this was a year ago.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt takes about 3 years to get all that out.\n\n But parasites do not create endometriosis.\n\n Endometriosis occurs when the body is lacking regenerative ability somewhere, and it needs cells from some other area and it happens to pick an ovary to take those cells and to plant them somewhere else, to borrow those cells.\n\n\r\nSo, when you go into a period, not only are your ovaries reacting, the cells that have transported somewhere else that are normally ovarian tissue, react on that same monthly pro cycle.\n\n So, you're having pains in other areas where those ovarian tissue cells are alive.\n\n That's what endometriosis is.\n\n That occurs from having some kind of damage somewhere in your body that needs new cells or live cells and your body goes to the ovaries.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Epstein Bar & Guillian Bare \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about other viruses like the Epstein bar virus\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEpstein bar, that's a natural?\n\n Basically, that's a natural one.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWould you say that was one of the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome or not really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n But Epstein bar is a natural one in reaction to chemicals in the body.\n\n Just like disease, which is a extreme form of anaphylactic shock.\n\n \r\nGuillain Bare is complete paralysis.\n\n You're actually a vegetable.\n\n That mainly happens after vaccines.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nFlu shot.\n\n What the Epstein bar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, Guillain Bare?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about the Epstein Bar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe Epstein Bar will happen under that situation too?\n\n It's chemicals.\n\n \r\nVaccines, mostly vaccines, any injection that can be- you can be allergic to penicillin and get the same kind of reaction.\n\n \r\nYou can get yellow fever from a polio vaccine.\n\n How your body responds, it depends upon its own nature.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow would you get rid of it though.\n\n The Epstein Bar, any specific tips?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I didn't want to get into that specific for Epstein bar because sometimes what they identify as Epstein Bar is not?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's such an unusual problem, it would be nice to hear at least an overview.\n\n  \r\nIt would be so good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEpstein Bar is basically a breakdown of the lymph system, and if the lymph system doesn't flow and have what it needs to pull out the toxicity, then the whole system breaks down and you have chronic fatigue.\n\n  \r\nIt can move into lupus, which is degeneration of the connective tissue.\n\n That's the worst place I've seen it go.\n\n  \r\nAnd people who eat a lot of carbohydrates like breads and pastas, it goes there often.\n\n \r\nLupus or Ms.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nLupus if you have pasta and what else.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBread, carbohydrates?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, high carbohydrates.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Fasting \n \n**[2000],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLots of fats and meats are necessary\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI did a three week fast in January and I noticed a lot of improvements from the fasting.\n\n My postures improved, my breathing's a lot better, liver is shrunk, my digestive system's a lot better.\n\n \r\nWhat do you think about the idea of giving the body of the break.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou didn't really fast?\n\n You went on juices.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo, actually I did the myo kill, which is a little bit of milk, an dried role such it's well known in Germany and in Europe.\n\n I've just noticed a lot of improvements and I just wonder what you'd say about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I've done a tremendous amount of fasts?\n\n Even up to a 41 day fast and with urine and a 31 day fast with nothing but water.\n\n And I've done lots of other fasts experimenting: juice, feasts and all of that.\n\n  \r\nI've always found that when you get the body narrowed down, it functions easier, but it doesn't get well, it doesn't get better.\n\n When your body gets the nutrients to start getting in there and tearing it apart, then it starts to work.\n\n Let me give you an analogy.\n\n Let's say we have New York city, needs repairing.\n\n So let's say get it lean, you take out all the people and you take out all those cars.\n\n \r\nThe city's still gonna rot, it hasn't changed.\n\n You haven't re-plumbed it.\n\n You haven't done anything.\n\n You've just leaned it out and that's basically what happens when you fast.\n\n You've leaned the body down, but that doesn't mean the cells that remain- because you're going to start eating your own cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about the body's regenerate tissue on its own.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt can't do that?\n\n I've never found it able to.\n\n That's why you keep getting thinner and thinner and thinner.\n\n Now, if you took somebody, let's say 100 years ago and you fasted them and they were out in the wild and let's say they were farmers, you would be dead.\n\n \r\nThey looked for women who were Husky, had something on 'em because if anybody got sick, they could not withstand the temperatures.\n\n Either the highs or the lows, and most of the people would die, but we are not exposed to those elements.\n\n So, then you lose weight and get feeling a lot thinner and, and easier and lighter and breathing better, everything better.\n\n \r\nYou think you're much healthier, but then we put you in an environment that's harder and you'll find out you'll be less healthy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut I mean a lot of cultures have used fasting in the past.\n\n Haven't they, over thousands of years, the health and yogis have used a lot of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey did it at certain times of the year like in Israel during Christ time?\n\n As far as what I've read from the dead sea scrolls that they would fast in the late spring and late summer, not in the two hot times and not too cold times \r\nThey had to do it because they had no other way to help them detox.\n\n They didn't have access to lots of foods.\n\n There are lots of Europeans who would use fasting, but they didn't do the normal fasting.\n\n Let's say Bealer used raw liver and, and vegetable juices.\n\n Basically, that's what I do to get people to lose the fat that's toxic in their system.\n\n \r\nI have the meat, the juice and the egg or the juice and the meat.\n\n I've got a little bit down because I know that the egg will take out some toxins that the meat won't, help get rid of certain fats better, but I've never found fasting.\n\n And I studied that for 30 years.\n\n I mean doing intense fast with myself and with myself and other people and I've never found it to be more helpful than detrimental.\n\n There was always detriments, it was like [.\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n]?\n\n That's what it is cause your body eats itself and you're not putting anything good into it.\n\n It has to exist on what is already in the body and if what is in the body isn't great already, then you're not getting it any better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, there's no benefit to giving the body a rest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, there is?\n\n Like I say, what I tell people to do is eat the juice, the egg, juice, egg juice, egg, right.\n\n Juice, meat, juice, meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you're getting the nutrient, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n Right.\n\n Like you see me, I'm at the end of mine right now, so I'm pretty thin than normal, but still, I'm pretty solid.\n\n I can't get much thinner than this.\n\n Then I'll go up to my larger size, I'll gain about 15 pounds and I'll take it off again.\n\n \r\nLaurie taught me how to do it fast.\n\n So, I do it faster.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Forced Vaccines & Homeschooling \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAbout a private subject that you went on earlier, you said something about hepatitis\n\n He going to a private school, and they want them to have their polio shots, their hepatitis shots, all these shots, now since it's a private school, they're kind of like a club.\n\n \r\nThey don't have to accept you.\n\n I want 'em to have a good education.\n\n Can I go to them with like zero assembly bill.\n\n Is there's something I can go say, \"Hey, listen, I don't have to\".\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou've got an escape clause if it's your religion.\n\n Seventh Day Adventists have a form that says, it's against my religion.\n\n \r\nI do not believe this.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHe's going to a private Christian school though.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nYou can say you think it's against God's law to do that, \r\n\n \r\nI did speak to his current school about that, a preschool, and they're saying that they could accept us or they could decline for another reason and they don't even have to say that.\n\n \r\nI've been to all the other schools and for education purposes.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHave you gone to Highland Paul up in Northridge.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'm gonna try it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut then you have to have a doctor support that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, he's got, he's got medical proof since he has asthma and all that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThen you could say he's highly allergic to.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWith smoothies he hasn't had his problem anymore.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n We took him off of the nebulizer, and all those things.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIf he gets sick now, right now he's not on the total raw diet, just cause it's been hard transitioning him into getting into anything like that right now, since we're so new at it too.\n\n \r\nSo, if he gets ill and where he's gonna have a lot of complex carbohydrates, a lot of, a lot of that bad stuff or certain bacteria to feed on how would treat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou just feed him lots of smoothies, just keep it up to keep and then give him some raw chicken.\n\n So he'll, he'll go properly through it.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nSo, we're saying if a child that's on all these carbs in them or something gets E.\n\ncoli or something.\n\n It would be hard to treat that child naturally though, wouldn't it.\n\n What was it that you were saying?\n\n That the carbs would block?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf children only live on carbs, like in third world countries?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nOh, I see.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou can get lupus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can get all kinds of things.\n\n It can go any which way.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nBut still treating him naturally would be the way to go.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nWhich is what we're doing now anyway.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTreating only doctors can do, only doctors in the state of California can treat anybody.\n\n \r\nSo, you don't treat your son, you nurtured your son, okay.\n\n Because you saying that in public, the state of California medical division of the government can come after you for practicing medicine without a license.\n\n So, remember that you don't treat yourselves, you don't treat anybody.\n\n You nurtured yourselves.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nDon't we have the right to medicate ourselves.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you do not.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nNot unless you're sovereign.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs*, but then you still have to fight the law and they can put you in jail and you have to prove that you're sovereign.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nLike the recent email that you sent me about those people in Texas, they had a kid and they were trying to refuse some kind of radiation.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey wanted to refuse all those treatments.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd you can't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, the state went and got a judge to take the child away from the parents to treat him.\n\n \r\nBut that happens all the time.\n\n I witness that with one of my clients, she had twins and these two boys we're on this diet and they were so healthy.\n\n They never had a cold; they were a year and a half old and somehow the state got involved.\n\n That's a whole story.\n\n \r\nThe state got involved, came and took the children away.\n\n The judge had had polio.\n\n So, he was brainwashed that it was because he didn't get the vaccines in time, and he had already had three.\n\n Why didn't he get him in time.\n\n So, he was prejudiced against this woman, having these two children and not getting vaccinations?\n\n \r\nSo, he ruled that these children had to get vaccinations.\n\n They were sick, sick, sick.\n\n I watched one twin die 10 days after getting injections.\n\n Some when you're that inundated, they were giving these children seven vaccines within a two-week period.\n\n The normal is three, but they wanted to get 'em into the children before the mother got the custody back.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nAnd one of 'em died.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot one of this one, another family, but these children were sick for weeks?\n\n Well months.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThere's an accredited school called Highland Hall up in Northridge.\n\n They will not require that they're very homeopathic and health and artistic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, there's also a man who out of New York city was a teacher, an accredited teacher for 27 years in New York.\n\n \r\nOne of the most accredited teachers have come out of an institution in all of time.\n\n He wrote a book that said if you want your children to learn, don't send them to school, homeschool them.\n\n It only takes a hundred hours to teach the normal child reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\n The only thing the child's gonna learn in normal school is how to be emotionally dependent, how to be drug dependent, how to be every dependent except, the one dependent you want is love.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Guillan Bare \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCan I ask a question that you mentioned about Guillain Barre\n\n My mother's had it for many, many years and recovered a little bit, but now has tremendous pains still in her legs to where she takes pain killers hourly, every two, three hours?\n\n I\r\ns there like a simple remedy for someone who won't eat raw meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I just don't know where you way you can get rid of it without raw meat?\n\n\r\nI mean, you could try to ease that by having lots of raw cream, and eggs, but cream isn't available.\n\n Avocados won't do it.\n\n you know, avocados won't do it.\n\n \r\nRaw eggs, and raw cream.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) High Meat With Poop \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAre there any do's and don'ts to aging\n\n Not only me, but meat also?\n\n I mean, do you need to keep giving it fresh air regularly to keep it aerobic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt will not rot?\n\n It will stop at a certain stage.\n\n \r\nThere are 17 stages of a cycle.\n\n So, if you want all cycles of them, then you eat 'em at all stages.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd are there specific advantages to each stage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n There are different stages that create different things.\n\n \r\nIt's better use your intuition because when I tried to do it on a scientific basis, there's too much to know that you can't know unless you're very psychic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut it's very important to keep the rotting process aerobic.\n\n In other words, fresh air?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAt my stage I would have to have the fresh meat rather than the stinky meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you need both.\n\n For cancer people, I say eat shit, really.\n\n If you want to get well quickly from cancer.\n\n E.\n\n coli, salmonella, all of those shrink tumors and reverse cancer.\n\n \r\nThe University of Toronto in conjunction with the hospital for sick children of Toronto did research for 20 years on the Aflatoxin produced by E coli.\n\n They found and they showed the research and the papers on it and all the data, the graphs, the pictures of the mice that were used.\n\n Shrinks tumors, dissolves tumors, and reverses cancer in 7 to 15 days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhere were they getting it from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey were culturing it from bowel movements?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you're saying E.\n\n coli, it would develop in the rotten meat, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no, E coli doesn't naturally exist?\n\n E coli is a natural bowel thing, like manure from cows or anything like that.\n\n \r\nI recommend people do ingest it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'm asking how, in what form.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nWell, you know what I told them?\n\n I said, if you really want to get well quickly, take some of those meats that you're rotting, wipe your Fanny with your finger after you go before you, and then rub it on the meat and let the E coli go on the meat, if you want to do it.\n\n \r\n[This is no longer recommended.\n\n You should use fresh fecal matter from a healthy animal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd how does the meat taste.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs intensely* \r\n\n \r\nIt's so bad smelling as it is, there's no distinguishing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou just hold your nose and swallow it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou wanna tell 'em how you get it down?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nVery quickly?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nI just cut it into very small pieces and I have my glass of milk and I put it in my mouth and drink it.\n\n Just don't even taste it.\n\n \r\nVery small bite.\n\n Just drink it right down, don't even chew it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nSmall amounts, small amounts at a time?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDaily or weekly.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nIntuitively whenever I feel it?\n\n I'm not on a regular program.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat's a small amount.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nTablespoon?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can do this after you go to the bathroom or just any time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* you take the meat that you want, whatever little amount it is and right after you go, before you wipe yourself, I suggest that you rub it on the meat?\n\n If you want that E coli to work for you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAnd then how long would you leave it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n7 to 15 days?\n\n It works then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd then do it every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUm, no?\n\n Well, it depends on how quickly you want to get well and how much you want to be a guinea pig for yourself.\n\n \r\nThere are lots of people who eat fecal matter.\n\n In fact, a lot of the Tibetans and the Hindu religions.\n\n \r\nAlmost all of your masters and your so-called avatars eat manure.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThey turn it into holy ash.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no, that's in this culture they've said, okay, this is what we do.\n\n We turn it into holy Ash.\n\n  \r\nThey eat it directly fresh.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nFrom the cow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFrom the cow and from other humans that are healthy, they always go for someone healthy to get the fecal matter from?\n\n \r\nSo I used to stay away from this subject like crazy because this is something that is in a very selective network.\n\n But since the University of Toronto last June came out with the research how E.\n\n coli dissolves tumors and reverses cancer in 7 to 15 days.\n\n I thought I don't have to, and then the salmonella with the Yale.\n\n  \r\nI'm not holding it back anymore.\n\n I've got some credibility there; people just don't think this guy is really gone.\n\n We thought he was gone with the raw meat.\n\n Now he's talking about eating shit.\n\n  \r\nWell, urine's been around for a long time.\n\n I did mention that in my book.\n\n \r\nBut I know people who've had terrible constipation problems and they said, \"Well, how do I get that environment back\".\n\n And I said, well, you can do it two ways?\n\n You can take clabbered milk, inject it into you, about four ounces.\n\n Get on all fours, get it in you.\n\n Then go down on your shoulders with your butt up.\n\n Roll your stomach, like a belly dancer.\n\n Get it to move up into your transverse colon.\n\n Then lie on your right side and roll your belly again to get it going down into your ascending colon and then the bacteria can feed on it.\n\n \r\nIf you want to do it even faster, eat somebody's fecal matter that's very, very healthy and preferably a carnivore like a dog or something.\n\n Dog looks for human to regenerate theirs.\n\n So, in fact, a dog will eat any fecal matter from any animal, as long as it's healthy to keep their bacteria levels.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do you know when it's healthy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I sell mine?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Intense laughter* \r\n\n \r\nI have given mine to several people and I'd gone on a particular diet for them, for the day before I go for that.\n\n And let me tell you, one time that they ate the fecal matter, it corrected the entire problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHave you experimented with cancer with the 7 - 15 day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUh, no?\n\n I've not found anybody who would do that.\n\n Laurie has just now started to do it with her cancer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd how often do you do it Laurie.\n\n Once every month or something?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, she's only done it once so far?\n\n**[Laurie]**\n \r\nWell actually eating the fecal matter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI mean rubbing the meat on the fecal matter.\n\n**[Laurie]**\n \r\nI just ingested the fecal matter.\n\n I rolled it in a little piece of meat.\n\n I didn't taste it at all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou made a joint outta it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe washed it down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat kind of cancer do you have.\n\n**[Laurie]**\n \r\nUm, kidney, breast, and hip?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHave you had radiation for it.\n\n**[Laurie]**\n \r\nNo, I haven't done any medical therapies for the cancer, but I have had other things gen, injections and chemicals, things like that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow long ago, when did you find out you had it.\n\n**[Laurie]**\n \r\nI've known for about four years?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) How Many Eggs Per Day \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow many eggs a day\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends upon the individual?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, because I thought that makes crystallization, the egg.\n\n It almost feels like the white of the egg that's settling every hour on the inside of the nose, and I thought maybe I'm eating too many eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that's when that serum from the cancer cell dies and sets out a serum, which dissolves a surrounding scar tissue.\n\n That's that substance melting those tissues.\n\n It doesn't have to do with the egg white.\n\n You'd be so lucky.\n\n That's mucus that it will create to flow it out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, six eggs a day is pretty average for someone like me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUh, no, I usually have them eating more if they can get raw cream at the same time, but it depends on how much weight you're willing to gain?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI already gained 35 pounds.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it's also time to take it off.\n\n Like I say to people, I like people to gain, you know, overweight.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Illegal Milk In California \n \n**[2000],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe don't have milk easily available\n\n In fact, it is illegal.\n\n This milk Claravale milk is illegal in Los Angeles County.\n\n They can call it off the shelf at any time.\n\n \r\nIt's the only county in California, that is illegal.\n\n You can get it any other county in California.\n\n\r\nNow I've been fighting this for about a year and a half hard.\n\n I met with Zeviar Slosky's.\n\n health deputy last week or the week before, about 10 days ago?\n\n We were talking about the whole issue because I think that they should just dissolve the Los Angeles medical milk commission because we have the warning label on it.\n\n \r\nWe don't need a commission to look over the bacteria level because we know it has bacteria in it, and we want it to have a bacteria in it.\n\n So, get rid of the medical milk commission.\n\n They don't want to do it.\n\n Everybody's afraid of the bacteria, but they listened to me and he said, you know, you've got a good point.\n\n\r\nYou have the bacteria label on there.\n\n It should be released.\n\n It should be, that's a good argument because they let alcohol, they let cigarettes out, they have all that, and those are known problems, and a lot of the people that I speak with in the health department who MDs say that milk is a problem.\n\n\r\nI said, okay, so that's a problem, we've got a label on it.\n\n Let's have our problem.\n\n \r\nSo, it may come down to another demonstration.\n\n Now I've had two demonstrations a year apart.\n\n The first time 8 people showed up, the second time 20 people showed up.\n\n If you give a fuck, show up.\n\n\r\nAnybody that comes here and gets on the mailing list will get a notification.\n\n You've got to show up because if there aren't a hundred people to show up, the media will not attend and nobody cares.\n\n Nothing will change and we need to change it, which Zeviar Slosky's.\n\n health deputy Ron Hanson said to me, he said, \"You're able to get milk here, Claravale milks on the market\"?\n\n And I said, \"Yeah, even though you're not enforcing the law.\n\n Anybody at any time could say pull it and that's it\".\n\n \r\nI want insurance that you are not gonna enforce the law because I don't want the law to exist.\n\n\r\nThe only way we're going to be able to do it is to show up in numbers.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I'd like to do it in June?\n\n It's a hot time to be downtown Los Angeles, but to organize everybody, it takes a few months.\n\n Maybe the end of May or mid-June, it'll be on a Tuesday.\n\n Tuesday is when the board of supervisors, who is the boss for the LA medical milk commission convenes on Tuesdays.\n\n\r\nSo, you've gotta show up at 9 o'clock in the morning, and you've got to be there till 2:30 - 3:00.\n\n I had some people that would come in, drop in for two hours and then take off.\n\n We did not make an impact.\n\n They didn't give a shit.\n\n Only one network showed up and it was a Spanish speaking network and I don't even think they aired it.\n\n\r\nSo, if you care about having milk and the freedom, you've got to speak up.\n\n I can't do this alone.\n\n I've been fighting this battle alone.\n\n I can't do it.\n\n You guys got to help me and help yourselves.\n\n So, I hope I have everybody's name and number.\n\n If you haven't received a flyer from the people who mail, then you're not on the mailing list.\n\n\r\nIf you received a flyer for this, then you're on the mailing list.\n\n If you didn't receive a flyer, get on the mailing list, it means leave your name and number with me.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Ionizers \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about ionizers\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI did research on ionizes in the seventies, in the early seventies and at that time what it caused was toxic molecules, including tars in the air to solidify and harden, and if you're breathing those, it's not a good thing?\n\n \r\nSo, I found it was okay if you had the ionizer on when you're not in the house.\n\n\r\nWhen you're in the house, don't have it on.\n\n If you have an ionizer in your house and you have a picture, and you remove the picture and the whole wall's black, except for the where the picture is.\n\n That's what it does to your lungs, but it's only while you're in the room.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIonizers clean the air.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what they say it does, but what it does is it cleans the tars out of the air, but then the molecule shoot right into something hard?\n\n That means it's gonna go into your body.\n\n You're inhaling.\n\n It's gonna go right into your lung walls and that's like smoking marijuana.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Kidney Stones & Gallstones Healed From Fasting \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSome experience of mine, I had kidney stones, I had gall stones, I had an ulcer in my stomach and I got rid of it fasting on water and that's very good\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I've seen people do that, but I also see the damage done to the rest of the body for fasting.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell for a long time.\n\n Sometimes 30 days, sometime 21 days.\n\n I, I think I fasted more and anybody in this room and I really came out in a good way.\n\n\r\nMy eyes got better.\n\n My vision got better.\n\n I couldn't hear good, this cleared up.\n\n So, I got very good results.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said, people who fast get better about their conditions, but not necessarily over the whole.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou don't think fasting might be good for certain kinds of people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUm, I've not found a situation where I saw it better than the side effects.\n\n**[unclear]**\n is fine for.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nFor 24 hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it may be for years, but then it comes to that point where the damage done may be.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Mercury Filling & X-rays \n \n**[2000],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah\n\n I wanted to talk to you about dentists and how, how they take x-rays of your mouth and all that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't let 'em.\n\n I do not let them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey could still do their work and all that.\n\n Can you refuse that.\n\n Do they freak on you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI find a dentist and I've always been able to find a dentist who will do it?\n\n\r\nThey'll just say, if I do that and I can't see a cavity that's not visible.\n\n I can't be held responsible.\n\n You say fine, I'll sign a waiver.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about getting the mercury out of your fillings.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI think it's a good idea once you've stabilized?\n\n\r\nI had one of my clients who was in critical condition with cancer all over and two weeks ago, she went and had a mercury out, she's on her deathbed right now.\n\n She hasn't been out of bed since.\n\nShe only had two of 'em removed at that time, and I told her, wait a year and a half.\n\n And people kept telling her your Mercury's one of your main problems, it's killing you.\n\n\r\nAnd I said, no, it's not,\r\nNow it's released into her system and all of a sudden, all the injections that go along with it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe Novocain.\n\n Is the Novocain that bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it's terrible?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat do you use.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't, when I got, I had my teeth drilled on for eight hours and I didn't have anything, but marijuana?\n\n\r\nI ate some marijuana and had the pain formula.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about nitrous oxide.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a gas?\n\n It can really damage your system.\n\n\r\nI'd say the nitrous oxide is a little easier to detoxify than the Novocain because one molecule of the Novocain- because it's not from cocaine anymore.\n\n The Novacain used to be created from from cocaine.\n\n Now it's a synthetic product, and it takes 40 to 60 molecules of fat to bind with one molecule of that Novocain to get it out of your system.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow effective is your pain formula for dentistry level pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUh, it's pretty good?\n\n It's very good.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBring a couple quarts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* well, you drink nothing but that for a whole day before you go?\n\n That and the cheese, and then you you probably won't feel much of anything.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Wheat GRass & Growth Hormones \n \n**[2000],[Barbara]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAajonus, I need to ask a question about wheatgrass\n\n\r\nIs it something that we should do because it's not anything that's on my diet, but somebody said Barbara, you should be drinking wheat grass, and I thought I would check with you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I've been experimenting for the last year with wheatgrass juice because of the people, Owanza and other people who were using growth hormones.\n\n\r\nNow, a lot of people are using these human growth hormones, which are extracted growth hormones from plants, usually grasses, and they were claiming incredible results.\n\n However, the people that I tested them with that would be helped the most with Ms, MD (muscular dystrophy), and other problems, chronic fatigue, reacted so badly that there was something wrong with it with.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\r\nFrom the wheat grass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, from the human growth hormone?\n\n So, I decided that if I'm going to have to give some people an alternative, I would have to try to invent something.\n\n So, I was looking at the wheat grass.\n\n They used the wheat grass because it grows so rapidly.\n\n\r\nSo, it has high growth hormone ability.\n\n So, what I did was I decided to stabilize it in milk.\n\n So, if you add like three ounces of wheat grass to 29 ounces of milk.\n\n You'll get a good proportion, and that helps the growth hormone stimulation.\n\n I've only been working with it for about a year now, but it seems to be working pretty well.\n\n\r\n[This was later discontinued.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n29 ounces of milk.\n\n That's a lot of milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you take a quart of milk, you drink three ounces out of it and then put three ounce of wheat grass in it, you shake it up and you drink it over a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does it stabilize.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt stabilizes the growth hormone properties?\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\r\nWhat is grow hormone.\n\n They're doing some stuff with that and it's more natural?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but I got it completely natural HG1.\n\n And let me tell you, terrible.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\r\nWith cancer, do you want growth hormone.\n\n I mean, anything that growth scares me?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I haven't been using it, but with one cancer client for the fear of that.\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I better wait.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would wait.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you drink a quart in the day or just a few ounces.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI drink the quart in a day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, usually the growth hormone supplements, you take them twice a day, every day.\n\n So this is you just do whenever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I do it maybe three times a week, two times a week.\n\n That's all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that liquid wheat grass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, but you need to put the wheat grass in the milk immediately?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Why Women Liver Longer Than Men \n \n**[2000],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nTowels\n\n Those were my handkerchiefs.\n\n My handkerchiefs were towels because I was putting out so much mucus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCame out through your nose.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n Now, like I said in the last two, your bowels are your whole body.\n\n You're all one big asshole, everybody, because basically the body is gonna use every means it can to dispel the toxins that are in the system.\n\n \r\nIt's going to use the mucus membrane.\n\n It's going to use the skin.\n\n It's going to use the ear wax.\n\n It's going use the salivary glands.\n\n It's going use the tear ducts.\n\n It's gonna use the vaginal cavity in women.\n\n It's going use the penis in men.\n\n It's going to use every hormone it can to throw off everything.\n\n \r\nBecause the vaginal cavity in women is so large and the mucus membrane is so great.\n\n Women have the ability to detoxify that way, they have that extra bowel that men don't.\n\n I think that is why women live longer, almost 20% longer.\n\n So, all of you, women who say, oh God, I wish I didn't have that period every month.\n\n You know, it's such a hassle.\n\n  \r\nLet me tell you, get on a good diet, so it isn't so rough you're not going through so many headaches and so many cramps, after a few years, you'll be glad you have that.\n\n Because you're a lot better off than men are, a lot better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCouldn't men dispel through their semen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo.\n\n Well, if you were ejaculating six, eight times a day, sure.\n\n \r\nYou'd probably keep up with that.\n\n But then you've got eating problem that has to keep up with that because there are some pretty rich nutrients that have to be utilized for semen.\n\n You know, because of the quality of what it has to be.\n\n  \r\nAnd all men who are sexual live a little bit more.\n\n You hear about those men that still have sex in their nineties.\n\n They smoke and drink.\n\n They do anything, but they just keep that, but a lot of that has to do with adrenaline too.\n\n \r\nAnd adrenaline has a tendency to be able to nullify a lot of the toxicity of the system.\n\n Yes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes that mean that like adrenal discharge, that's sign of detoxing, releasing stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCorrect.\n\n Now I've known women, when they start on the diet, they start detoxing heavily out that canal, and they'll actually burn holes in their underwear from it.\n\n That's how bad.\n\n \r\nOne woman I have the diet right now, she is discharging brown and green fluids, and its tearing labium up.\n\n Burns it, swelling and this is pretty toxic stuff.\n\n She has cancer, so she's discharging out that canal.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) X-Rays Prevent Healing 6 Months \n \n**[2000],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDon't get x-rays because one x-ray can prevent healing for up to six months\n\n You cannot regenerate cells if they've been irradiated.\n\n That's the point of radiation therapy.\n\n It's to make sure cells don't regenerate.\n\n Well, sure.\n\n That's fine.\n\n You have one cancer cell to about 5 billion cells.\n\n So, how many are not gonna regenerate.\n\n\r\nAnd if those cells can't divide?\n\n You are not going to heal that area.\n\n So, you don't go running to a doctor and get an x-ray.\n\n If you have to know something, demand that they do it with a sonogram, as long as you're not pregnant, you will be fine.\n\n Sonograms will not hurt you.\n\n If you're pregnant, they could hurt the eardrums of the child.\n\n\r\nIt may have tone deafness, something like that, but as long as you're not pregnant.\n\n A sonogram is the best way to know something, if you want to know something.\n\n The only time I ever want to know something, is if I have a broken bone and it needs to be reset and it would have to be a pretty serious bone for me to go to a doctor to do it cause I would do it myself.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Cheese With Other Foods \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n I've said all this stuff already\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot about cottage cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Any kind of cheese, it's the same.\n\n There's no enzyme activity, even in cottage cheese, it's too dry.\n\n So, there's no bacteria that is alive to help utilize the enzymes.\n\n So, it's an absorbent, unless you eat honey with it directly.\n\n\r\nNow, you can eat cheese with a milkshake and still, the honey is already united with and chelated and bonded with the fats and the proteins and the other sugars in the food that you're eating.\n\n So, you eat cheese with a milkshake, the honey in it is not going to change the ability of the cheese to absorb and pass out without digestion.\n\n You have to put the honey and the cheese together in the mouth to do that.\n\n\r\nCottage cheese isn't different, just a little dryer.\n\n That's like if you were dead and you were dead and you were half dry, are you more alive when you're half dry than completely dust, a hardened leather.\n\n So, it's like that?\n\n Once you've reached that point of cottage cheese, there's no live bacteria in it anymore to facilitate digestion.\n\n\r\nI won't put it in the light, because the light has a tendency to cause fats to go bitter.\n\n Pardon.\n\n I put it in a dark cupboard?\n\n \r\nJust get more oxygen in, it'll dry out a little bit more.\n\n It gets the aerobic bacteria to grow faster.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Colon Cleans, Prodbiotics \n \n**[2006],[Dave]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI did a three month colon cleanse right before just happened and then I kinda started changing drinking a lot of milk and went into the bathroom, really hard like a brick\n\n So, butter will help that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well, the colon cleanse destroyed all the bacteria.\n\n**[Dave]**\n\r\nYeah, I washed it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, destroyed it.\n\n**[Dave]**\n\r\nSo, to rebuild.\n\n Can I use worm probiotics.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't really work, it's not the same bacteria?\n\n Worm casings isn't the same as your own bacteria, E coli.\n\n**[Dave]**\n\r\nWhat would rebuild the intestine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEating shit?\n\n Eating buffalo shit or cow shit, something like that would get it quicke.\n\n\r\nIf you want to do it another way, take some soured milk and put it up there as a suppository like you would a light enema.\n\n Only you use soured milk and you put it up in there and you keep it in you, and that would help build the e coli again quickly, they could feed on it.\n\n\r\nHigh meat is also helpful because it's broken down to a point where the bacteria can feed on it readily by the time he gets to the bowel.\n\n\r\nYou can do it in about two weeks if you don't put it in refrigerator.\n\n I explain how to do that in the recipe book.\n\n You have to open it every 2 days, instead for every 3 - 4.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) COlostrum \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nJoe, do you have a question\n\n**[Joe]**\n \r\n\r\nColostrum, is that better than regular milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends?\n\n Colostrum is the milk produced by the cow for the first five days after giving birth.\n\n Most of the fat is not in a cream form, it's in a butter form.\n\n Liquid butter form.\n\n So, it is much easier to digest.\n\n \r\n\r\nRemember I stated before that cream has to go through quite a process, two-thirds have to go through quite a process of the enzymatic activity to separate the H2O from the fat to make it into a butter, to lubricate and strengthen two-thirds of the body's needs.\n\n Only a one-third of the cream can be utilized to help the nervous system, but the other two-thirds of that fat has to be made into like a butter fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, the first five days is a butter fat and not a cream, so it stabilizes that baby as soon as it's born, that calf, as soon as it's born, gives it five days to firm solid, make things more solid in its skin and its hair, everything.\n\n And if it just had cream, it would be anemic.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou having had psoriasis, I'd be eating, butter and cream.\n\n I'm eating sheep's cream right now.\n\n and sheep's butter.\n\n So, you need that lubrication formula.\n\n**[Joe]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm having it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOne a day.\n\n**[Joe]**\n \r\n\r\nSometimes two?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nKeep up 2, as long as you have dryness, you need two a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThe money you pay for the extra colostrum is not worth it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, for some people it would?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhich conditions is it recommended most for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDigestive problems and skin problems?\n\n Those are the main.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nHow do they get it when they're not having calves or are they having calves every week.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, they've have calves all year round in California?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nBut only for the first five days does it produce colostrum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey have 450 cows?\n\n They're having cows born every week.\n\n The Amish community, they may have, in their whole community, may have 50 calves born a week, all year round.\n\n It's a little warmer here than it is in New Zealand.\n\n New Zealand has all those high mountains that bring a hell of a cold front.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd here in California, it's year-round, there's lots of them.\n\n There are some months though in winter where they don't have many calves as far as our Amish in Pennsylvania, getting it from them.\n\n They're very limited supply.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut organic pastures, when I was there, they dropped five calves that day.\n\n I was there three years ago in December, first week in December.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut only for the first five days does it produce colostrum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey have 450 cows?\n\n They're having cows born every week.\n\n The Amish community, they may have, in their whole community,

\n### (4) Detoxing Toxins From Cereals \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm experimenting for the detoxification book still\n\n I had a month before I had to travel again, so I went on a heavy detoxification trial run.\n\n And again, I was trying to get rid of a lot of the toxicity that was built up in cereals cause I was an addict cereal eater as a child.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSugar crisp.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSugar crisp, and 4 tablespoons of sugar in the sugar crisp?\n\n It was already deadly sweet.\n\n So, all that heavy, heavy sugar with the pasteurized dairy, and I'd go through a half gallon to a gallon of pasteurized milk a day.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to work at detoxing that again, and I thought, I got my first parasite almost two years ago, be two years ago in July when I forced that milk and fermentation and the sugar cane juice fermentation.\n\n And the tapeworm lives on sugar byproduct and mainly the people who have tapeworms are people who eat lots of grains, lots of cereals that have no value.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey've been processed like children in Africa that have no food and we give donations to these companies to feed them and then the companies go and give the money to Purina or General Mills or somebody like that, and they send over the worst cereals possible.\n\n Cereal, and water.\n\n So, they make these hundreds of millions of dollars from all these donations and give the worst food they can to these children and all that sugar product forces a tapeworm to eat up the excess sugars, cuz if they don't, they'll just rot.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, the tapeworm is a good thing for that environment.\n\n So, analyzing that, I thought, well, that tapeworm, I got the tape worm when I was in Cambodian and Vietnam and eating fermented sugar cane and fermented milk and that forced the tapeworm that I had.\n\n And like I said one other time when I talked about it here, I got this craving about three weeks later, I think it was three, three or six weeks, I have to look at my notes and I had craving for onion, so I sat there and ate a half of an onion and next morning, you know, I shat out 45 - 48 feet of a tapeworm and I was devastated cause it took me 38 years from after having the chemotherapy and radiation to get a tapeworm or any kind of parasite because I was so poisoned from the radiation and the chemotherapy that no parasite could live in my body and very few bacterias.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I had to do everything in the relationship of solvents, which are virus and that's much more toxic and takes longer and it isn't as efficient.\n\n So, I decided, well, let's see what happens if I go on a milk diet with lots of honey in it and let it get about 24 hours old before I do it and I put it in a bowl of hot water, only about 105°, but that's the highest a cow's body temperature gets, unless it goes into fever.\n\n So, I had to leave it in there for about two hours and keep warming the water every 20 - 40 minutes, I did that, added a little cream to it also, so I was drinking anywhere from a half gallon to a gallon of milk a day with that honey in it and after about five days, if you go on the internet and look under dermatological diseases or skin diseases, and you ask for photographs or pictures, you come up with all these different rashes, these different things coming out of the body.\n\n And one of them, it says fix drugs and it has areas, it could be on the penis, it was on somebody's back and on their sides.\n\n That's what I started throwing off, all of these drugs, like chemotherapy and everything, I had lots of diarrhea from it, and it smelled like the chemotherapy I had, which was AZT back in those days.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt was outlawed, the year after they gave it to me was outlawed and then they brought it out of the vaults again when AIDS came up cause they had billions of dollars of it in the vaults and they deemed it too toxic to give to cancer patients.\n\n So, without any testing they said, \"Oh, it works for aids\", no testing.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey just wanted to get rid of this drug, make money and kill people with aids.\n\n So, anyway, I started detoxing the AZT and I still have it coming out.\n\n Big dry patches all over the place.\n\n My chest and back were just riddled with all these hard sores and then they would come up as hard spots first and then, like this one, comes up as a hard spot and then it'll turn into a scab and it goes deep too, rip it off.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I took a few of them, lots around here right now, dissolved them in a distilled water solution and then put 'em under an electronic microscope and then there was lots of crystallized structures that looked like the AZT and other chemicals that I've had, and even mercury molecules in it.\n\n So, started pulling outall this stuff.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I've had this for a month now, and sometimes it gets so itchy, especially in my back.\n\n You'll see me rubbing my back up against the wall or a hole going like this because it's so itchy.\n\n Get some sun on it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnyway, two weeks ago it was intense.\n\n See how these hard things come out all over and then they'll scab.\n\n Got coming on my arm.\n\n All over my legs, all the way down to my legs and feet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, the detoxing things that you've done up until now were not sufficient to bring this up to the surface.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDrugs are hard to get removed because they're so toxic?\n\n So, that's what I was trying to see, how much I could get moving with this and then the parts of the tapeworm came up a few, maybe a month or month and a half, six weeks after I dispelled with the diarrhea after eating the onion.\n\n Then I saw segments again, and then after about probably a total of four months, a shat out another 45 - 50 feet.\n\n I never saw him again, that was the end of it.\n\n No sections, no anything, until I did this milk, fermented milk cleanse again with all that honey in it.\n\n And I was putting a half a cup of honey per half gallon of milk with a little cream in it to force this thing on.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd guess who came up.\n\n Tapeworm showed up again?\n\n About a week ago I saw sections of him coming out again, and every time I have a bowel move, I see a few sections, so he is in there helping me eat up all the sugar damaged tissues, it's dumping into my lungs.\n\n That's just not drug related, it's coming through my skin.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd it's coming out everywhere here, I used to have psoriasis, Joe, you recognize this kind of thing.\n\n I had psoriasis so bad, like when your hands, I had all my elbows, I had on my knees, ankles, everywhere, and I haven't had this kind of condition for what, 30 years.\n\n Something like that?\n\n  \r\n\r\nI didn't know that it was so much chemically related, the psoriasis, because I thought psoriasis is mainly an organic disease that was from mainly cooking foods, especially cooking meats.\n\n It's like causing gout in some people and causing arthritis and rheumatism in others.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I found that when I did this and all the drugs started coming out and this started happening, in the tissue, the whole area was hard.\n\n Like there were no nerves in it or anything, it just deadened everything and the scraping from here, this was the worst area, and the scraping from there showed the same kind of AZT and the other crystalline toxicities from chemicals.\n\n This is mild to what it was.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy did it create the hardening.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy do you think it caused the hardening?\n\n Did you think it was the burning, any of the chemicals coming out or, yeah?\n\n Well, a lot of you have to understand with a chemical like that is already attached to dead cells.\n\n It's already a part of dead cells.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe dead cells just moved out of the bones and out of the other tissue and the, and the, um, ligaments and the tendons moved out to the skin to be, uh, to drop off.\n\n Cause you know, it.\n\n It doesn't come off easily.\n\n It's gotta flake off and die.\n\n But this whole area here is numb.\n\n So, you think detox and then you work on your, your filters first and over a long period of time, you think detox comes out in the cellular level.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs that, well, that's the, I mean, you can take it after the intestine, but can you imagine this going out through the intestines?\n\n You'd have peritonitis and you'd be very sick and probably die?\n\n So, it has to come out the skin and that's what I've been trying to do is get things out just to see what would happen.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm not one that believes in forcing detoxifications, but I think it's just be patient, let it happen over a 40-year period, rather than forcing it.\n\n But when I see the damage that out that chemicals have done in people's bodies from medication, I started thinking, there's some things that are not going to be able to be removed unless you help it.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I knew that if you take a food that you've eaten a lot of in a cooked for pasteurized form, where all the bacteria and natural products in it that allow it to break itself down and ecologically recycle itself, all those are destroyed in cooking.\n\n So, if a compound in your body, if the structure in your body is made of that kind of compound, there's no way to get it out, unless your body goes through extreme measures like creating virus, which are not alive and are just solvents made by intercellular.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, that's a long and hard process and can the cells do it with those kinds of drugs and chemicals in the system, which are meant to poison the body.\n\n AZT chemotherapy is meant to poison the body to kill cancer cells, but like I said in We Want To Live, for every one cancer cell, kills 1 billion - 2 billion healthy cells.\n\n \r\n\r\nDoesn't make any sense.\n\n So, that's why I decided in the last two years experiment with detoxification regimes off putting fermented products in my body that I eat heavily to detox them from the system.\n\n And boy, it sure is working, it works like a charm.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNow I did that a little bit of that in the 70s and 80s with grains.\n\n I'd ferment grains and then take the fermented juice and sometimes a little bit of the fermented grain and eat that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs that the rejuvelac thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's like a rejuvelac, but I'd let it go further until little molds would form?\n\n They usually don't let it go that far because molds clean your body naturally like bacteria and parasites do.\n\n \r\n\r\nYour body resorts to making virus, which are not alive to dissolve things that are too toxic that would destroy and kill any bacteria, parasite, or fungus.\n\n Like candida, giardo, all of those.\n\n Those are natural, those are healthy, but they're for detoxification, even athlete's, foot, all of that stuff.\n\n \r\n\r\nI've been employing those things for the past two years actually to experiment and see what would happen and it is speeding things, obviously, I didn't know I still had this much in my system and I did not know it was systemic.\n\n Of course, it's gonna be systemic, it goes right into my vein, so it's stored everywhere.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe only place that hasn't broken out was on my face.\n\n I had a few spots on my face and just a few right here on my neck and some bleeding ones here, and then one on my ear here, which bled.\n\n But other than that, no, it wasn't.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (5) Different Dairy Products For Dif Remedies \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you can get raw milk and you just have to separate it\n\n You get the milk and you separate it.\n\n You get the cream, and then you make cheese with the other and drink the whey.\n\n That's a good balance.\n\n \r\nIt's funny how dairy can be, you can take milk and you can separate the cream and have the cream or make it into butter, and then you can take the whey from the butter milk\r\nAnd you take the whey from making the cheese and each one of them favors a particular disease.\n\n And if you separate them, they become an individual remedy.\n\n Like the whey is great for arthritis and rheumatism, gout, stuff like that.\n\n You get sore, you get stiff; you drink a cup of whey, almost gone by the next day.\n\n And then you have a 1/2 cup a day after that to keep it away completely.\n\n Depending if you're detoxifying a lot of urea in your body, then you're gonna need 1/2 - 1 cup a day, depending upon the size of your size of body.\n\n\r\nAnd the cheese absorbs toxins cuz cheese is dried, there's no active enzymes in cheese, so there's no bacteria to help the enzymes facilitate enzyme activity.\n\n So, cheese is a detoxifier.\n\n It'll absorb poisons, it'll help magnetize them out of the blood, the lymph and the neurological system, as those fluid channels run through the stomach and intestines.\n\n\r\nSo, it just attracts it out, and you get all those heavy metals and toxic substances into the bowels or in stomach or in the small intestines, locks onto them and will pass it out without digestion.\n\n If you add honey to the cheese and eat honey directly with the cheese, it turns it into a mineral supplement.\n\n\r\nAnd then of course, the butter is the only thing that'll lubricate the bones and the skin and the tendons and the lymph system very well.\n\n\r\nAnd the cream is the only thing that will sooth and completely take care of the nervous system.\n\n So even though you can other elements of food, you can't separate like that and then have a favorable thing happen.\n\n\r\nNow, if you take a tribe like the Fulani of the Samburu, and you start separating those too much and too often, and then it'll cause them imbalances.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Don;t Eat Seaweed Or Nori Sheets, Salt \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd you were eating seaweed with it every time\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, it did have this like sprinkle?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, that's salt.\n\n That's what's causing your mind to go, hyperactivity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then I went out to the Volcano National Park and they have all those sulfuric ephemeral holes and checking out those.\n\n And then I went out for a hike and I was just like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, you breathed in some sulfur.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWoo.\n\n And you had already had the salt, which dries out the system and then your brain must have just closed.\n\n \r\nDon't ever have seaweed, high in salt, dry your system and cause you to be hyperactive.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt doesn't have mercury.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they have some, and again, when it's cooked and dried like that, it's cooked?\n\n And it releases all the heavy metals in it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut when the seaweed is growing in sea, it's incorporating that just like it is you utilizing anything in the garden.\n\n That salt has been taken through and changed.\n\n It's like the minerals in the soil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut it lives in a salt water environment.\n\n That's a different environment.\n\n The concentration of sodium in that plant is very different from a plant you'll have here on the earth.\n\n\r\nYou put that concentration of sodium in the soil there, and it will kill everything here.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, when I use sea salt on my plants it doesn't do that, it does the opposite.\n\n It doesn't kill them at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhere.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI've been doing it for years?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no.\n\n I'm talking about a salt water environment.\n\n I'm not talking about putting a little bit of salt.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI mean, I used to get it by the trailer load and put it around the farm closed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn those mulch that you buy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n Off the beach.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're buying it and you put it there.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI've done that for years?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat plants did you fertilize with it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAll my vegetable done have been done with seaweed?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd how did you mulch it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nChopped it, and put there?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou didn't mulch it first.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI do both?\n\n I used to make compost and I used to put it round the plants.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n If it's composted, it'll break it down.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, I understand, but I just put it round the plants and I had friends have done it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you put it on top, it's just gonna dry up.\n\n It's not gonna leak  down into it till it breaks down.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, but you put straw on top so that it won't dry out.\n\n Otherwise, it doesn't lock down as quickly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut it's gotta break down to release the sodium.\n\n But how much of it going to hit the plant.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, it all does cause you do it all the time gradually?\n\n But I mean, it doesn't kill it.\n\n I don't even wash it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but we don't have dirt in our body to filter it out.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI realize that, but what I'm saying is that much, you only have a little bit of salt.\n\n\r\nIs it really that bad for you for all the minerals you put it with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're asking what I've seen?\n\n Yes.\n\n It causes what it did with him.\n\n It causes dehydration of the brain.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Eggs, Milk and Meat Digestion Time, Eat Eggs and Sulpher In Eggs and Milk \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, usually when somebody is very, very ill, they're not digesting their food properly, so they can't digest complex nutrients\n\n They can't digest meat, they can't digest sometimes even milk, even though that's already liquid, when you look at an egg, all of the fat and all of the proteins are in complete liquid form.\n\n\r\nSo, there's just a fraction of the digestive time.\n\n It takes 10 minutes to completely digest an egg.\n\n Completely digested, absorbed, and already in your blood, in your nervous system, everywhere in your system.\n\n Milk can take hour, couple of hours, 5 or 6 hours, even meat, 16 - 20 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRaw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven raw, because it's a hard substance, has to be broken down?\n\n\r\nSo, if you're eating eggs, you don't have to spend all that energy and digestion and you going to heal and you can cleanse and you can recuperate.\n\n \r\nThat's why that woman I talked about that gave us an example in the Recipe Book that had emphysema that was supposed to die that weekend and she'd been on oxygen for almost 2 years and had been diagnosed 7 years previously and hadn't been out of the bed much in two years was out of the bed and walking around and off the oxygen in two days of eating eggs, 66 eggs over a two day period, 33 a day.\n\n \r\nThe eggs can do that, but that's the only food that I can see that can create that miracle kind of experience with almost everybody who eats them.\n\n There are other people, you you can give them combinations or selective foods and it'll change her whole life instantly, but it doesn't work on everybody or most people.\n\n\r\nBut the eggs will work on almost everybody.\n\n People with environmental sensitivities that come to me and they can't eat anything.\n\n They can maybe drink water or they'll have an allergic reaction to even water, put 'em on the eggs and they can live on the eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the sulfur in the eggs, is that a problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not a concentrated sulfur?\n\n It's a lot of sulfur, but it's within the balance with the fat and the protein.\n\n If it were a problem, you'd better believe I would be a mess.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm trying to understand why it's not a problem, so I can apply that logic in situations.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe milk's very high in sulfur too, but it's not a problem.\n\n It's just not as as digestible as easily absorbable and utilizable an egg.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Esophageal Cancer \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I didn't mean not to give your sister-in-law any hope, but it's one that scares me because it's so difficult, it's hard\n\n When you see a cancer patient with lung cancer trying to get up the stairs or exhausted.\n\n Their lungs are filling up, they can't breathe.\n\n They're stopping and panting, and that's the way it is.\n\n And it could take 3 - 5 years to get through that stage.\n\n Will they get through that stage without running to the doctors and the doctors are promising this, \"Oh, well, we will cut it out and you'll be okay or we'll give you radiation therapy and you'll be okay or chemo and you'll be fine\".\n\n\r\nAnd they always tell them this.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Finding Raw Dairy In Asian Countrie, Get From Muslims \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou'll find a lot there\n\n If they don't have it, you ask, you find out what is the word for raw.\n\n If you go into, let's say Thailand and you say, um, let's say, neux dib, raw meat.\n\n Now, neux dib to them can mean usually by the way they eat now, Old tribes, people would know neux dib means raw meat, like we eat it.\n\n\r\nBut neux dib to most of the younger Thai's means you're eating meat alone without anything dressing with it, but it's still cooked.\n\n So, I have to say neux dib, suit suit, my suk, means no cooking.\n\n  I have to go through this whole thing to describe it.\n\n So, you have to learn how to say to get exactly specifically what you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBrush up on your Hindi.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah and let's say you learn 50 words and you can get all the foods you need that's all, ask for the food correctly.\n\n And in Thailand it's very difficult to find milk, unless you ask and almost all of the Muslims.\n\n Lots of Muslims in Asia, tremendous amount of Muslims, they do dairy.\n\n They've got goats, they've got cows, they've got milk, but they never take it to the markets.\n\n So, you see somebody you know wearing a a Muslim outfit they always have the best meat too.\n\n\r\nI always buy my meat from them cause they knew how to raise those animals.\n\n They're healthy, they're hearty, the people and their animals.\n\n So, I always buy from them and  I'll say, can I get some raw milk.\n\n I say in Thai and they bring me goat milk or cows milk?\n\n They'll have a certain day that they'll bring it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Getting Sick In Other Countries, Vaccines \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you're already used to bacteria, so when you start getting bacteria in other countries, it's not foreign to your body, so it just adapts to a new bacteria\n\n Also, there's the issue that when somebody goes to a foreign country, they're told not to eat anything raw, so they'll eat everything cooked.\n\n\r\nThen they have no enzymes, and they'll go into diarrhea, sickness, and cold.\n\n For example, there's a movie called Latino that was shot in 1984, and it was written and directed by Haskell Wexler and one of my patients was the third lead in the movie Tony Plano and Tony Plano got this legalized legal size sheet of paper, both sides with literature on it.\n\n It was everything was kind of like this, everything was centered, so it didn't take up all of the page, it would've all fit onto one page.\n\n They weren't so creative in the way they designed it.\n\n It was everything you should not do, and it's everything that you do on this diet was not to do.\n\n\r\nYou don't drink the water, unless it's boiled.\n\n You don't eat any food, unless it's cooked or steamed, including fruit.\n\n Even watermelon, you steam everything.\n\n If you go outside, you always wash your hands before you touch your face.\n\n It was endless about what you cannot do.\n\n \r\nSo, he is handed me that and he says, what do you think.\n\n\r\nI said, \"Tony, if you do the opposite, if you drink the swamp water, if put all that bacteria everywhere?\n\n You eat your raw meat, you eat your raw eggs, you get some raw dairy\".\n\n And they shot it in Nicaragua.\n\n And it was about the American interference in Nicaragua at the time, uh, by Bush and Reagan.\n\n\r\nAnd, and he did exactly as I said.\n\n He was the only one out of the 42 people on that set, we're talking about cast and crew.\n\n Only one who did not get sick.\n\n Robert Beltran, who was the lead, got so sick he lost 50 pounds.\n\n They had to write a whole new segment into there showing he got sick cuz he lost 40-50 pounds, could have been more.\n\n Shut down the film for two and a half months he was so sick\r\nRobert did a little bit of the diet before he went down there, but he didn't eat anything raw while he was down there and everything was processed and cooked.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhether it's Africa, Asia, South Africa.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGetting that indigenous bacteria in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's fine.\n\n It just adapts as long as you're used to eating bacteria.\n\n You're already adapted, this whole garbage about, \"Oh, let's vaccinate you, but watch bacteria\".\n\n Wait a minute, you're injecting disease into me and you want me to adapt to that, and you don't want me to adapt to the natural bacteria that's in everyday life.\n\n What are you crazy?\n\n Precisely, they are nuts?\n\n They're out of their mind.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) How To See If Honey Is Heated \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust remember, always take it and put it on your tongue and let it sit in your throat\n\n If it eats at your throat, it burns your throat almost starts you coughing.\n\n It is definitely heated and that's the way I test it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Isolated Nutrients, Plants Eat Rock \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, yeah, it has to do with all of it\n\n Very complex.\n\n A man has his head up his butt because he can't even make anything grow.\n\n He can't make an apple from scratch or seed from scratch that grows.\n\n He always has to use other elements of nature and to think that he's smart enough to make something a balance is absolute stupidity because their intelligence, micro intelligence, microcosmic and macrocosmic intelligence that are all partaking in the exchange of building something.\n\n Isn't this one human brain that's working it all out, that's pure stupidity.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd when you cook something and you chemically treat it, you've gotten rid of all of those other cosms and you're just working on one and that's mainly where plants live.\n\n Most of those things you can feed plants, but if you put too much sodium somewhere, you'll kill certain plants.\n\n You put too much sulfur somewhere, you'll kill.\n\n Plants do the same thing, but plants eat rock.\n\n That's what they do, they eat non bioactive substances.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe rain comes down, dissolves rocks and they eat it.\n\n But we know that trees and plants will grow even faster and fuller if you're using biochemical mulch where there is decaying vegetation or human excrement or animal excrement around, it'll thrive.\n\n  \r\n\r\nFor example, I have a fern that was an indoor fern.\n\n The container was about this big, and it was about this full and I planted it in my garden because the deer and the golfers eat everything.\n\n They don't leave anything for me, the only thing I can grow is peppermint or spear mint.\n\n \r\n\r\nI got spearmint growing all over and this fern and the jasmine, they don't seem to eat- the one year they loved Jasmine, most of time they don't.\n\n So, I planted this one little bitty fern out there about three years ago, so I didn't fertilize it at all the first year and it grew, it probably doubled in its size as ferns spread.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd the next year I thought, hmm, I'm gonna see what will happen if I punch it with a lot of human nitrogen.\n\n So, I collected my urine and I collected my eggshells, and I blended the eggshells, until they were a powder.\n\n I mixed it with my urine and took some Terramin clay and put a little bit of that in there and then I went around.\n\n I took a container with a lid and poked holes in, went around, sprinkling it all over the dirt around there.\n\n Everything doubled that year.\n\n So then last year, I'm not gonna put the hole in the cap, I'm just going to dump the stuff.\n\n \r\n\r\nI always do it in February, low season when it's cold and when things aren't thriving at that time, they're all about to come out in the springtime, about to blossom.\n\n I'm just pouring it on the dirt and it quadrupled.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe fern now goes from that wall to here and it goes from that post to here.\n\n That's one year growth from when I just poured it on.\n\n Now, if you take urine from an animal that each cooked food, like human urine or dog urine that's grown up on Alpo and canned foods, it will actually burn and ruin the roots not help it grow.\n\n It will destroy growth.\n\n And here I saw mine was causing all this tremendous growth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat fern is getting water from an irrigation system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nUh, no?\n\n It has a sprinkler system.\n\n So, it gets water about every three days.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (13) Lung & Esophogeal Cancer \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's a hard one, it's a very difficult one if it's advanced\n\n The two that I don't like to handle because they're so difficult is lung and esophageal.\n\n  \r\n\r\nLung, because the lungs keep filling up with fluid and it takes medical intervention to get the fluid out of the lungs and they'll usually puncture the lungs and then pull it out and you keep poking the lungs like that, it doesn't help.\n\n So, it's very, very difficult.\n\n Only 60% of those that I've worked with reversed, medical profession, none reverse unless they remove the lungs.\n\n And then there's usually a 5 - 6 year period when they're dead.\n\n That's the longest they live, but about 90% of them die within a few years of getting lung cancer.\n\n \r\n\r\nUsually, if they get treatment, they'll die within a few months, unless they have surgery.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nShe's against any kind, chemotherapy or stuff like that or radiation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut still, if her lungs keep filling up with fluid, which it does to help eliminate it, she has to be able to cough it up to get it out of the body or else it has to be aspirated through medical needs and that's complicated and that creates sores, which makes more fluid collect in the lungs, so it's difficult.\n\n  \r\n\r\nEsophageal is bad because it'll choke off the vocal, the esophagus, the ability to breath and eat.\n\n You can't breathe and eat, you're dead.\n\n So, that's a difficult.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe worst case I had was after it was removed, the man had esophageal cancer all the way down, so what they did was they, they had maybe three inches of esophagus left.\n\n So, they cut it all out, put his, put his stomach up in his shoulder, and his lungs way over here, so it was all attached right into his throat.\n\n So, the guy was on constant meds, and he was in constant pain and he died even though he went on the diet and did it 100%, it only allowed him to live for another year and a half, year and three months.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHe should have been dead probably within a month, month and a half.\n\n But he suffered that whole time, even on the diet, it reduces pain by 50%, so he's taking less meds, but it was still very difficult.\n\n A difficult situation.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen there's some people who catch it early enough and they go on the diet and they'll get colds and flus and keep bringing the stuff up properly with the mucus, instead of water.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWell, if she has fluid already collecting, then egg every half hour or her waking hour, little honey and butter in between.\n\n And that's what she should eat until she gets the strength, until she builds the mucus instead of fluid, should be all the almost exclusively that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nRaw eggs, one every half hour and maybe a teaspoon of honey and butter, equal parts of honey and butter.\n\n 1/2 teaspoon - 1 teaspoon every 15 minutes after each egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow about vegetable juice like celery.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCause water to build up in the lungs, unless she sips it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs there any way you can have a consultation with her if she comes to this space.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, it depends on when she would come.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (14) Lung Cancer and Surgery Is Best Medical Therapy \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSurgery, I've seen with lung cancer, I've seen less deaths in probably the medical therapy, the surgery helps people live a lot longer\n\n One woman had, I don't know if you remember who she is, Laurine Tuttle, she's like my second grandmother and very good dear friend of mine, and she got lung cancer in 1969 and she had, this is just when I was barely a cripple myself.\n\n\r\nShe wouldn't eat the raw meat, she would eat it rare, but she wouldn't eat it completely raw.\n\n She only had three lobes of a lung, half of her lungs gone.\n\n And she did quite well.\n\n Also I knew John Wayne and John Wayne had just one lobe left, and he lived three years with just one lobe, but he was an alcoholic.\n\n\r\nHe just stayed numb all the time, destroyed all bacteria cuz he was drunk all the time.\n\n But he was able to survive that.\n\n But he was not a happy person and nobody liked him because when he was drunk, he was just obnoxious, constantly obnoxious.\n\n \r\nSo, people can survive with medical therapy, but what is the quality of life.\n\n But the surgery, although Harbin B?\n\n Jones says that he thought that surgery was the worst therapy that you could do, I think that surgery is the least harmful of the therapies in my experience of medical intervention.\n\n\r\nIn a case of cancer, there's definitely 60% chance you'll live doing this diet.\n\n And if you go with the medical profession, probably 17% chance you'll live over 5 years.\n\n \r\nAnd that's why the medical profession pulls out this magic number 5 years.\n\n Do you know that if you reached the magic number 5 years, you're considered cured of cancer.\n\n\r\nNo matter if the next day or next year, you get it again, they consider it a whole new case of cancer, which they cured you the first time?\n\n \r\nIt's all pharmaceutical double talk to get you to do what they want you to do.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Malaria \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\n I've gone to the swamps; I've swam in and I drank the water\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHave you been bitten by mosquitoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I don't get bit by mosquitoes very often, unless I eat watermelon?\n\n And if I eat watermelon, they're on me within 5 -6 hours.\n\n I end up eating a piece of watermelon every time I'm in Asia, so I do get maybe 10 bites out of two months, which is nothing.\n\n They get eaten alive and I've never gotten malaria, it's all absolute stupidity.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (16) Msm & Sulphur \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nMSM\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's a terrible thing?\n\n It's sulfur and sulfur dries out the system, it's like an antibiotic.\n\n They used to use sulfur as an antibiotic for kidney diseases and stuff like that, sinus diseases.\n\n MSM is a dangerous substance.\n\n Sure, it'll stop detoxifications and it'll get rid of your symptoms, but it makes the body worse.\n\n \r\n\r\nSulfur stores in the body, can't break sulfur down, especially when it's that concentrated.\n\n I find in people all the time, it creates serious mental problems later down the line, or intestinal.\n\n Sometimes it's systemic.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut it just dries out the system and back in the early 70s, there was a- it was 60 minutes or 20 minutes, one of those.\n\n They did a segment on women who spontaneously combust.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nThey showed it recently.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nReally.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOnly women were taking that kind of sulfur drug to do it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat would happen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat would happen was they'd be standing there and they spontaneous went up into flames?\n\n Not around any fire or anything, just went up in flames.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs this real or science fiction.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, this is real?\n\n And they showed the burns of the body and everything.\n\n One woman, 2/3 or 3/4 of her body had been burned.\n\n It was pretty bad, third degree.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDid she die.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, she survived and this was, I think somewhere around 1967-1969 that happened to her?\n\n This show was built and aired about 1972.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd then they showed other women, two other women who had gone through the same experience, but not as much as their bodies.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I was racking my brain out at that time trying to figure out what would cause those women to spontaneously combust.\n\n I knew it had to be a chemical related to nitroglycerine, that if it had a certain sulfur base, as soon as the oxygen would touch it, it'd go up in flames.\n\n So, that was a year later when I figured that out.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I thought, Hmm, I wonder.\n\n So, I called a friend of mine who was the head of publicity at MGM and I said, \"Listen, I need this to find out who these women were.\n\n I need their names or phone numbers or addresses where I can write or call them\".\n\n So, he gave me the number of the show.\n\n  \r\n\r\nLike I said, I don't remember if it was 60 minutes or 20, and I called the show and they got permission to give me the numbers.\n\n So, I called the three women and the one who had had the worst burns had been on sulfur drugs for 32 years for kidney problems.\n\n The other woman who was next, I think a third of her body burned, she had been on the drugs for 27 and the woman who had burned about a quarter of her body or a little less, 20% of her body had been on for 13-17 years.\n\n Something like that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSulfur is not a natural thing.\n\n No element in nature is high in the body, except for calcium, potassium, and phosphorus.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut the potassium and phosphorus don't hold up in the system.\n\n They're very transient.\n\n Calcium is more stable in the system, sulfur is a very small part of the human body or any animal's body, and if it gets high, it will cause dryness, severe dryness.\n\n Most of your Dristan's, your antihistamines are full of sulfur.\n\n \r\n\r\nCan you imagine, the body's trying to get rid of the poisons through the mucus discharge, and you're gonna dry it up with sulfur.\n\n What's going to happen?\n\n The poisons that the body is trying to reject with the mucus are going to remain in the tissue.\n\n So, you're going to have more advanced and chronic disease as the years go by cuz you're not gonna be cleaning out the system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat is why my father that's got these sinus problems, he did all the antihistamines and keep making it worse.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (17) Next Book On Detox \n \n \n \n \n### (18) Nothing Is Theoretical \n \n**[2006],[Attemdee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nActually Aajonus, I've been on a track similar to yours, but not nearly as long, and, and I've studied several different people and so I'm really just interested in the parallels that you have to offer to all the other people I studied\n\n I've taken a lot and thrown it away and taken the good and saved it, so I just have to compliment you.\n\n I think you're on the  track.\n\n If I could say anything at I'd say, I've learned that that life exists on a physical, a mental, emotional, and a spiritual plain, and then you can be balanced.\n\n So, I would treat everything in a balance like that.\n\n So, it's not really a question, it's just a compliment.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I'm interested in what works, not with theoretical.\n\n Like I said, when I wrote the book, all of my books, I was putting in there what works, and all the explanation was just theory.\n\n This is probably why it works, but we're not that smart to be able to say this is absolutely what it is.\n\n \r\nPeople like science, they like logic, and they like rationale.\n\n So, to me it's all bullshit and I'll give it to them.\n\n If that's what they need, but that doesn't really mean that is the reason\r\nThe meat works, hhe meat helps heal the body.\n\n The eggs help rebuild and revitalize the body faster than anything else.\n\n The butter helps lubricate the body and keep it good and solid firm and the cream soothes and relaxes the body.\n\n \r\nSo, these things are the key answers that I have and how to combine it to get people out of the diseases is how I've been.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Org Pastures Milk To 32 Deg \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWe get all of our dairy for our group, our buyer's group from the Amish\n\n We don't buy anything at Organic Pastures.\n\n Cause when he went to 32° for everything, his milk, now he's denying it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAs soon as it comes out, he puts it 32°.\n\n I told people about it and now he's lying that he doesn't do that.\n\n He does.\n\n temperature.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat temperature should it be.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI like I told him it shouldn't go below 45°?\n\n \r\n\r\nMilk won't freeze at 32°, unless it's held there for many hours and it's not churned.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy do they do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBacteria?\n\n Bacteria.\n\n Afraid of bacteria.\n\n So, Mark McAfee, who owns and runs it, he put all of it in his son's name, so he doesn't own anything now cuz he knows he owes me, he owes James Stewart.\n\n He owes Martin Sheen, we got these people, Martin Sheen, his wife put in like 40 grand and he hasn't paid him back a dime.\n\n He keeps saying, oh, we'll pay you, we'll pay you.\n\n He just keeps getting bigger and he goes around bragging he makes $3 million a year already and he doesn't pay us.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd he went from glass to plastic and then he went from 39° - 32° and chilling.\n\n It just gets worse and worse.\n\n And he goes around the world, he goes around, literally around the world bragging that he has the best dairy in the world.\n\n He's nowhere near the Amish, any of them.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey're very good because they are on my diet, those farmers are on my diet.\n\n A lot of the Amish are on my diet now too.\n\n A lot of those people are supplying us with foods are getting on the diet cuz they're finding out it's working for them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDoes Amos Miller.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAmos doesn't, but some of the others around us, Amos has talked about it and he says he's gonna start doing it and I think he has, but he hasn't come back and says, yes, I'm doing it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI didn't realize the fact that you said it was all cooled.\n\n We didn't know that.\n\n I was trying to support the Californian dairy, but I didn't know that they took it to 32°, you hadn't told me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI said it here.\n\n, it's the second time I said it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nOrganic Pastures, that's from Whole Foods, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it's California dairy?\n\n It's still better than nothing.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHe also goes around bragging that he's purely grass fed, he feeds them grain at the time of milking, and he was feeding them cooked grain for a while.\n\n He was giving them rolled oats and then he was giving them a rice bran one time and it was making the milk really bitter and nasty because there's gibberellic acid in rice bran, and this guy, even though he was raised on a dairy farm, has no clue about dairy farming.\n\n \r\n\r\nHe left it as soon as he got out of high school, cuz all he did was milk, that's obviously all he paid attention to from his father and mother, cuz when he decided to make a lot of money and a killing going into the raw, organic dairy business, he saw big money there and didn't learn as he should.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy can't somebody else do it in California.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou know how much it costs to set up a dairy?\n\n Extraordinary?\n\n Extraordinary amount of work.\n\n Extraordinary amount.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow about converting one of the other commercial.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you can get 'em to do it?\n\n Very difficult.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I tried to get one of the Stuvy Brothers up in Northern California, you know, Stuvy used to be the raw dairy here, and they kept promising that they would do it and they didn't.\n\n And then Mark Mcafee came around and got all this money together for him, and he did it and now he doesn't give a shit about us.\n\n He wouldn't have never been in the business without us.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow much did you guys give him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, altogether we gave him about, well he had already had the dairy going, but he was selling to Horizon, but he doubled his herd and plus he started making cheese, so we loaned him almost a $100,000 altogether and he hasn't paid, I think, but maybe $15,000 of it back?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, what can you buy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou'd have to go to Arizona to get it or have them ship it to you?\n\n That's why I have everything shipped to us, we truck it to us every week in LA, but I've got these Amish people who send it to Aruba.\n\n I've got patients in Aruba that have it shipped all the way there.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nYou know everything that's available in LA, it's available up here.\n\n We have a Co-op; you order once a month.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd you're getting the same dairy we have up there, so we're getting it from the Amish in Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow long would the milk last.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt'll be sour?\n\n Raw dairy never goes bad.\n\n It just turns into bitter cheese.\n\n So, if you don't mind eating soured milk, it's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you put honey in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou can put a little honey in it, it'll last couple of weeks without starting to turn?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut at the turn will it be a little bit sweeter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it's sweeter?\n\n Yes, definitely, it's sweeter and it's more digestive.\n\n More sour it is the more digestible it is, so it's fine.\n\n Just may not be as enjoyable.\n\n \r\n\r\nOnce it's kefir and it separates, all you do is shake it and it's right back emulsified again.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (20) Psoriasis \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI didn't know that it was so much chemically related, the psoriasis, because I thought psoriasis is mainly an organic disease that was from mainly cooking foods, especially cooking meats\n\n, it's like causing gout in some people and causing arthritis and rheumatism in others.\n\n\r\nBut I found that when I did this and all the drugs started coming out and this started happening, in the tissue, the whole area was hard.\n\n Like there was no nerves in it or anything, it just deadened everything.\n\n In the scraping from here, this was the worst area, and the scraping for there showed the same kind of AZT and the other crystalline toxicities from chemicals.\n\n\r\nThis is mild to what it was.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Recommended Water \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n I have a couple short questions and then like one that I'd like to elaborate for, like sun exposures, is that fine\n\n Do you encourage that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, sun is very important?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then weat germ, do you like wheat germ.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWheat germ, like I said in the book, there's no pure wheat germ?\n\n\r\nTthey have to solvent process or heat process.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much water do you recommend people go hydrate with.\n\n How often and best sources of glass water?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGerolsteiner is my favorite, but that's higher in carbon dioxide and it's the carbon dioxide from the well?\n\n Well, it looks like now Perrier is no longer buying the gas that they've lost in their well from them, so they're using an artificial.\n\n\r\nSo, there's still Gerolsteiner, there's Ramlosa.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd sometimes that will come in plastic, but you don't recommend any plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n I don't get any water in plastic and water's the worst thing you could do besides the acid juices in plastic?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Vegetable Juice With Eggs, Vegetarians \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I found that if you have lots of eggs that it causes a certain amount of acidity cause of the dryness and it starts pulling out a lot of toxins\n\n And by having the green vegetable juice, it helps replenish and rebalance the system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut you don't want too much, you didn't want it every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause it interferes with the digestion of the eggs?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause it's two alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI can theorize that, but I don't know?\n\n I can theorize why.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut you found once every four days it's better than once every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends.\n\n Three days, three to four days.\n\n Some people can go five days without having a juice.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI found that it does interfere when you're eating like an egg every half an hour to an hour and that's mainly what you're eating.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nJust quickly then from the following on from the alkalinity, everyone now writes books and says if you're drinking alkaline pH water, like 7.\n\n4, you're not going to have cancer, etc cause cancer and all the chronic diseases of the day are result of acidy in the system that there's less oxygen in the system.\n\n Can you just quickly, because everyone who comes to people who own themselves and say this, this is what's being spread.\n\n What do you have to say about this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nTheoretical bullshit?\n\n You said a short answer, that's theoretical bullshit.\n\n There's no evidence of that.\n\n You take a look at the clinics like The Optimal Health Institute, here near San Diego, or where is it.\n\n Lemon Grove and you've got one in Florida?\n\n \r\n\r\n2/3 of those people drop dead in less than 5 years.\n\n 2/3 dropped dead within five years from that experience, and most of them do very badly.\n\n There used to be several therapists there that found out my method worked better so undercover they had their meat and everything illegally in their rooms and little coolers or little bitty refrigerator and they were sending people to me.\n\n One woman they sent had multiple myeloma and she had just come from the ISL clinic to there, and nobody gave her hope.\n\n I put her on a diet in 30 days, her multiple myelomas reversed.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat kind of alkalinity, that whole idea is a stupid concept, it is really a ridiculous concept.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAcidic conditions can cause problems, so you're saying it's a balance between the two, not just extremely one or the other.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, I would say probably you're going to get more disease if you go on alkaline for a long time for the human body cause the human body is like all other animals?\n\n All other omnivore and carnivore animals are mainly acidic.\n\n Their urine, their saliva is acidic.\n\n \r\n\r\nChildren should not have vegetable juice under 16 years old unless they absolutely crave it, and it will disrupt their whole digestion because it causes over alkalinity, your digestive juices and bacteria must be acid in your digestive tract to digest any animal products.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWe know we're not vegetarian, very few people can sustain human life on vegetation.\n\n That's why there are very few vegetarians that don't get cancer and do very well, and I've only met 8/3000 people who could accomplish being pretty good vegetarians, they were even athletic but that was cuz they had all this high testosterone, high adrenaline, and high thyroxine, and even a couple of 'em had high thymus productions, but that's what generated their health.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they were naturally very over acidic because of those hormones secretions so they could take all that alkaline food and do okay with it.\n\n But the longest term one I met, he was on that raw food hygiene program, raw food alkaline with no meat, no eggs, no dairy for 52 years, and then all of a sudden, his whole spine started disintegrating.\n\n \r\n\r\nHe used to come to the health shows that I did, and he'd be one of those hecklers of the audience.\n\n And he said, \"Well, I've been vegetarian for 47, 48\", every year he'd show up that I was speaking, and then all of a sudden, it's 52, he didn't show up anymore because he was doing my diet, because his spinal cord just started disintegrating.\n\n \r\n\r\nHe was in excruciating pain, he couldn't live.\n\n He became an invalid and then when he started eating the raw meat and raw dairy, well, he mainly eat raw eggs and raw meat and kept the dairy down, he still has a hell of the prejudice against dairy, but he'll use the butter and he was back on his feet within about six months.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, but he doesn't tell people, he tells people to still do the hygiene and vegetarian die.\n\n He eats the meat and eats some dairy, but that's a mentality.\n\n So, we're not vegetarians.\n\n We need acid bacteria, we need acid digestive juices to break down meats and, and dairy and eggs, that's the nature of it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd if you're trying to digest fiber, it's not going to happen because we have 2.\n\n5x less digestive tract than an herbivore.\n\n We have one stomach, the duodenum and the herbivores have from 2 - 4 and they have 60,000x more enzyme to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the protein and the fats.\n\n \r\n\r\nWe can't do that, so their B12 goes down and they're sucking up this processed soy garbage as they're protein.\n\n 50% of my cancer clients were long-term vegetarians, 50%.\n\n It was people like Linda McCartney.\n\n \"I'm vegetarian and I'll never get cancer\".\n\n She died of the most aggressive breast cancer there is.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAre you linking her cancer to your vegetarianism.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n You're alkalinizing the body and you're feeding it bad proteins, processed soy and nuts, grains that you can't digest.\n\n If you're a bird you can digest nuts or you're a squirrel, but we're not those.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (23) Vegetable Juice, Vegejuice For Children \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, all that alkalinity is not what we're supposed to be\n\n I used the vegetable juice cause we're so toxic.\n\n We have so many acids, we're over acidic from all the cooked foods that we've had.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSee, that's confuses me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, that helps balance it a little bit, we put in those alkalizing minerals, they attach to the acid minerals and could neutralize them so it doesn't interfere with us.\n\n\r\nBut children, even though they're eating cooked diets only need maybe 1/2 a cup once every two weeks, even if they're eating cooked foods.\n\n If they're eating raw foods, unless they were born to a very, very toxic mother, and those toxins went from the mother to the infant to the fetus, only they should have just a minute amount of vegetable juice.\n\n \r\nI got one two year old on the diet and she has signs of she looks like she was born to a vegetarian woman.\n\n Now, the mother had been vegetarian for six years before she went onto my diet, ultra skinny.\n\n Well, she didn't recover enough and I told her, don't have a baby now, you wait seven years til shes been on the diet.\n\n She had a baby.\n\n I think she's got pregnant within 6 months as she got gained all this weight, she felt so good and she said, \"I'm healthy enough to have a child\".\n\n I said, \"No, you're not\".\n\n So, she had this baby and this baby looks like it's been a 20 year vegetarian.\n\n More than half of its body is full of dead cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow can you tell the body is half dead cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn the irises if there's a lot of scar tissue and I can see how much of the body proportion and 50% of that child's body is dead cells?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWow.\n\n That's terrible.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And another vegetarian that had a baby, well, she had a fetus growing and it miscarried at about five months old, the baby was see through.\n\n\r\nYou can look at it, it looked like a plastic baby, translucent.\n\n You can see the veins and the arteries and all the different parts as if it were this plastic model.\n\n And when we looked at the tissue and it was all nerve tissue, she had had spinal cancer and brain cancer.\n\n So, her body took all these dead cells and built them into the fetus to get 'em out of her system.\n\n\r\nShe called him her angel.\n\n She had something like 60 tumors in her spinal cord and brain altogether, and she reversed so many of those cancers dissolved during that pregnancy.\n\n But the body took those cancer cells and put dead brain cells, the neurons and built them into this fetus.\n\n\r\nThis baby was built out of tumorous nerve tissue that was translucent, it's the wildest thing I've ever seen.\n\n So, the body does phenomenal things and when a mother comes off of vegetarianism, just cuz she gets on the diet or anybody gets on this diet, they're not infallible.\n\n\r\nYou have to be careful.\n\n This woman had that baby way too soon and now the baby shows signs of anemia.\n\n can't digest well,  just like a 40 year old vegetarian.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut she's gotta be better off than a vegetarian having a baby as a vegetarian.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, definitely.\n\n\r\n Well, this woman's smoker too and she never stopped smoking, so that added to the problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of vegetarians have babies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n But this woman was a smoker too, so that contributed to it so there was a lot of damage in this child.\n\n Now, at two years old, the child's going for the raw meat and is starting to gradually move out of that, so it's thankful she's able to.\n\n Some children who are raised like that in a vegetarian type system, the meat repulses them, and they will never eat it and never recover properly.\n\n But this child, all of a sudden, two weeks ago to start devouring the raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy does the meat repulse them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause they have so much alkalinity in their intestines and systems that they don't have the acids to break down the meat, so it repulses it?\n\n A lot of vegetarians can't go into eating meat within the vegetarian diet if they continue eating salads and drink a lot of juices.\n\n The meat repulses them because they don't have the digestive juices to handle the meat, they'll start vomiting.\n\n The food will pass through, go into diarrhea, all kinds of problems.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) West Nile Vairus \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n With the aids, they put it in the smallpox vaccine, was given to 75 million people\n\n Guess how many countries, the World Bank now runs those countries.\n\n 27 of those African countries cuz they said, \"Oh, you've got this disease, we'll help you, but you have to pay us back?\n\n We'll give you all this medical supplies, all this chemotherapy to help your people survive this AIDS epidemic that you have, but you are indebted to us\".\n\n Governments can never pay back, so guess what.\n\n They now own the resources of those 27 countries?\n\n It's a different way of playing war.\n\n No bombs just go in there and poison them, get them sick, and take over their assets.\n\n \r\nSo, now America and England, the UK, those banks run that country from UK and and United States.\n\n Not a nice thing.\n\n They don't care.\n\n And the Ebola, according to Dr.\n\n Leonard Horowitz, he shows all the records that show that Ebola and West Nile is all created by again, the military mission.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAs far as avoiding getting any of these things or healing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou keep away from injections, you don't let a needle get near you and you'll never get it?\n\n\r\nIt's got to be injected.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) WHen To Eat Salt, Salt In Bath \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYou said not to, but I wondered why\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe only time, like I said in the book, the only times that I suggest people eat salt if they have adrenal exhaustion?\n\n \r\n\r\nThere's another situation, let's say somebody has gone into intensive vomiting and diarrhea and they're not holding anything down and they're starting to lose weight and they're starting to lose consciousness then I would use salt in a situation like that to help bring them back.\n\n And I would use salt in a mixture with whey to help bring them back to bring the electrolytes and the salts back into the body instead of using Pedialyte or something like that.\n\n Gatorade, that's what they do in hospitals.\n\n Gatorade You give Gatorade to a patient.\n\n Hello?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat would be the proportions of salt and whey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, it would be just a pinch, about a 1/8th of a teaspoon to about a quart of whey?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy do you put the salt in the bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it helps draw the toxic salts out of the body from years of eating table salt?\n\n Dries the skin a little bit, but you put the milk in with it, so it doesn't do that.\n\n So, with the milk, the salt and the vinegar in there, it's not going to cause that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's great for injuries.\n\n I used to race Moto and Durham on the street a lot and every time I hit the pave, I'd get road rash.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'd get some salt suck it right out, heal the wound 3x faster \r\n\r\nMight even try for what's going on with you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, I don't want to do it cause it will stop it and I don't want to stop it.\n\n I want all the chemicals, all that AZT out of my body, it's the whole reason I did it, so I'm not gonna stop it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy would it stop it.\n\n By pulling it out a bit faster?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n When it starts mixing with the skin then the skin changes its whole ability to release, so I found that it stops detoxification, not helps implement if you put it directly on.\n\n Getting in bath water it's diluted enough; it'll help pull it out of your system and I do that.\n\n I get into a hot tub several times a day, if at all.\n\n He said put it right on it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI put 2 tablespoons of salt and 3 - 4 tablespoons of vinegar and 1.\n\n5 - 2 cups of milk.\n\n .\n \n \n \n"

butter and honey\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it basically the nut formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you cannot make that crust out of that, it won't be a crust?\n\n But there's enough cheese and butter in it to neutralize the enzyme inhibitors.\n\n You won't digest the nuts at all, really.\n\n But it's a treat.\n\n it's a nice treat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Cold Milk Stops Digestion and How Long To Make Kefir \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nMilk is not a good idea to have a cold, especially if you have a digestive problem\n\n Cause when you drink the milk and it's cold, hydrochloric acid doesn't spill in, it goes through the duodenum and it's passing into the intestines undigested, then you get undigested proteins in the blood and you can get an allergy from it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWarm it up, or leave it out until it gets room temperature.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI always take mine out at least 10 hours before.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf I want keep kefir or yogurt, what I'll do is just shake up the milk and then take 3/4 of a cup out of the bottle and then put it in the cupboard and I'll let it sit there until it turns into kefir or yogurt, turns thick.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends, like in this heat, probably 2 days or less, 1?\n\n5 days.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe in between stage is where it's funny tasting.\n\n So, if you want it better tasting you take it out of it, shake it up, take it out of the fridge, shake it up, and just let it sit for 10 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDo you cover it up or do you leave it open.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, I keep it covered?\n\n And if you don't leave it where the sun hits it, if you leave in the cupboard, then it won't sour as much.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut there's that in between state, which is a funny state, but isn't as tasty.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (3) Cooked Saturated Fats and Vegetable Oils \n \n**[2001],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeasts don't feed on the fat, like saturated fats, but molds do, bacteria does and virus do\n\n They feed on protein and fat and I'll get even worse, try to break it down.\n\n They are not the problem.\n\n \r\nThe cooked saturated fat are a problem, but they're still not as bad as what as has been the major cause of arthritis and rheumatism is margarine and hydrogenated oils.\n\n\r\nWhich are of course poly saturates, they're not saturated fats, but those are the real culprits.\n\n \r\nLiquid plastic is exactly what it is.\n\n \r\nOn this diet, more saturated fat is best.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Min Consult 2 \n \n**[2001],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRelax your hand\n\n The left ovary looks pretty sound, the right ovary is okay.\n\n Debilitating a little bit.\n\n The adrenal glands look okay.\n\n It's like the right one is successively overactive for many years, so you be a very hyperactive person.\n\n Your pancreas is almost completely shot, so I would consider yourself a diabetic and only eat raw foods because whenever you eat a cooked meal, the pancreas has to send out hormones to every cell in the body and say, I need vitamins, I need enzymes, I need minerals, I need stable proteins, fats, everything that is your best to take care of this meal in here that has nothing to get some use out of it.\n\n \r\nSo, every time you eat a cooked meal, it overtaxes the pancreas and leeches from every cell, every cell that's unique or weak, or every time you cooked meal or cooked food.\n\n \r\nBecause your pancreas doesn't seem to be working, but maybe 5% - 6%.\n\n It's you best, you never even look at a cooked meal.\n\n It'll just all turn into complete poison, you won't be able to handle it properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI like being on raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLeft thyroid gland is okay, circulation isn't real good there, but the foundation of it's good.\n\n Parathyroids are very good little scar tissue around it.\n\n Lots of scar tissue in the tonsils, this side looks a little bit better.\n\n Not was with scar tissue, but this side developed a lot of scar tissue.\n\n Parathyroids here are normal, a little scar tissue on them and the thyroid over here is okay.\n\n\r\nLots of bile stored all throughout your system, you need the coconut cream to get rid of it.\n\n You have metal poisoning all the, your uterine area, ovary; berries and coconut cream are good.\n\n Lots of meat, lots of chicken.\n\n I would say about 55% red meat, beef, buffalo, bison, anything like that, lamb, and about 35% - 40% chicken.\n\n Turkey, any kind of foul, pheasant, peacock.\n\n I just had peacock last May and it was incredible.\n\n Very much like duck, but a little bit more like a rib flavor.\n\n And about 5% - 10% fish.\n\n\r\nAnd you need about minimum of 3/4 pound of meat a day.\n\n\r\nIt would be a good idea for you to drink a lot of milk, cause it'll pull some of the bile from the stomach.\n\n You might get a little nauseous, so maybe a little sugar size amount of cheese before drink some milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo I put honey in the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can if you like?\n\n\r\nDo you have any trouble with your spine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot usually?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nright around the kidney on the left side you have some metal poisoning, so you might get a sciatica reaction cause that starts cleaning.\n\n So, if you have papaya, make sure you don't have more than one papaya in a week or else it causesand  rapid intense detox.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGreen papaya or Mexican.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGreen's always better, but it could be Mexican green?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it couldn't be ripe or overripe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCause I always tend to like fruits that are more ripe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's more alcohol, there's a lot more sugar and less enzymes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Min Consult 3 \n \n**[2001],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n[This is actually a continuation of consult #1\r\n\n\r\nYou need the enzymes, you don't need the alcohol\n\n And you don't need all that sugar.\n\n And you have lots of metal poisoning in the brain and sinuses.\n\n So, you'll have some mucus from drinking the milk, but you want it.\n\n\r\nMucus is a very good thing, one way your body dispels poisons is built into the mucus and out.\n\n The only way you'll build mucus that is an unhealthy mucus is if you eat pasteurized milk.\n\n\r\nYou have scar tissue in your small and intestines, so you need about two ounces of olive oil every other day with one of your meat meals\r\nThere's a lot of metal poison in your liver, so it's functioning maybe 25%.\n\n \r\nHow old are you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n55?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're older than I am.\n\n \r\nEat lots of fat to get it working.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been on the raw food diet for a 1.\n\n5 years, just avocado and olive oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo dying.\n\n**[Consult #2 starts here]**\n\r\nOkay, Mike, it looks like you have advanced anemia and lots of bile the left testicle seems to be formed okay, but it is very weak.\n\n The right is more stable, but it's shrinking.\n\n The adrenal glands were normally very overactive, especially the left adrenal gland is a hyperactive nature of the younger person.\n\n Usually when it's that deep with the size of the mountains means over sexually stimulated, so if that still comes on you every once in a while when you're not fatigued, take care of yourself if you don't have a partner.\n\n \r\nAnd the pancreas on this side is almost completely debilitated, and on this side works about 25%.\n\n So, all together your pancreas is working maybe 15%.\n\n So if I were you, I would treat yourself like a diabetic, stay off cooked foods, and stay away from the sugars, even fruit, unless it's very low carbohydrate fruits, like berries and cherries and grapefruit.\n\n \r\nGrapefruit might have a tendency to lower your blood pressure a little too much and may make you fatigued.\n\n A little tired and a little unhappy, so don't have it too often.\n\n \r\nThis splotchiness here shows that you don't absorb oxygen well.\n\n You should be eating about a pound and 1/4 of meat a day, and 90% of your meat should be red meat, like beef buffalo for about a year and a half and 10% should be fish.\n\n And what you might do is every time you have beef, just a bite or two of fish with it.\n\n\r\nBecause you have a tendency to go two ways.\n\n You're not normal diabetic reaction where you're too alkaline and you have a tendency be over acid in some areas.\n\n So, you've got this back and forth movement so that you'll have, lets say you're having six ounces of red meat.\n\n, you have one bite, which is about a half of an ounce of fish with it, and that'll help balance it.\n\n\r\nLiver has some metal poisoning in it, the right kidney seems to be okay.\n\n The left kidney is very dry, it's like it's breaking down.\n\n Do you have any problem with your left kidney.\n\n**[Mike]**\n\r\nNot that I know of?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBack pain, leg pain on the left side.\n\n**[Mike],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I have that \r\n\n\r\nAfter about three months on a good diet, I would suggest that you drink your urine every third day?\n\n\r\nThe ammonias that it will produce will help clean out, you've got some kind of compound in the kidney, it's actually destroying the kidney.\n\n It's kidney atrophy.\n\n It means that kidney could disappear in about 6 years and stop functioning completely.\n\n But you have to be on a good diet for a while.\n\n\r\nThe first one in the morning, cause it'll have more of your healing hormones.\n\n 90% of the healing happens in the sleep state.\n\n So, when you wake up in the morning, you have more regenerative hormones in that one.\n\n That'll help go right to the kidney.\n\n First urine of the morning.\n\n\r\nDrink whatever you have.\n\n If it's a cup, drink a cup.\n\n**[Mike]**\n\r\nIt's a quart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*, do you have that much in the morning.\n\n \r\nYou need to wait about half an hour to have juice after that, and then a full hour after the juice before you have any meat?\n\n \r\nYou'd have the urine and then you wait a half an hour and have the juice, and then after you finish the juice, you wait an hour before you have the meat.\n\n\r\nI always recommend people drink the juice and right into the meat.\n\n If you go to egg or some kind of fruit, you're gonna put your body in a carbohydrate mode and you're gonna have a tendency to want eat food all day, want to eat sweet things and not eat the meat.\n\n You're not gonna be as clear thinking and you're gonna be much more emotional.\n\n \r\nSo, if you wanna be clear and direct and move through your day with self-control as much as possible, then always follow your juice with the meat meal, unless you're going through a lot toxicity like having the flu or cold, then you could have egg, milk and kind of a milkshake or smoothie and lots of chicken or even the lubrication formula with chicken, and that's all you need during those kind of detoxifications, and your juice needs to be about 30% parsley, that's pretty strong.\n\n It looks like some severe anemia, not just on a cellular level, but in a bone marrow level.\n\n\r\nIf you ate a heavy meal of meat with butter or some kind of other fat in the morning, you'd be able to be clear and not have that addiction.\n\n What you do is also make like a milkshake and a lubrication formula and have the milkshake throughout the day then have another meat meal.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust not eating enough meat.\n\n Your glands have not, it's regenerated a low bit.\n\n I can see it's stabilizing here, but over here, your ovaries are still debilitated.\n\n You have metal poisoning in the base of the left one.\n\n \r\nPancreas on the right side is shot, the left is maybe 10% functional.\n\n Maybe 10% - 20% functional.\n\n\r\nYou could probably handle four ounces every other day of fruit, otherwise you get depressed\r\nMetal poisoning all throughout the sinuses, so you should have some bleeding discharges when it starts coming out.\n\n Very dry sinus discharge and bloody when that starts to disturb.\n\n Lubrication formula is the best thing.\n\n \r\nJust remember that your body cannot redistribute your weight, cannot remove without the protein.\n\n\r\nSo, let me give you a different weight loss program.\n\n I'd like you to have a vegetable juice, only 8 ounces first thing in the morning, and I'd like to go for two golf ball sizes amount of meat, with a teaspoon of butter.\n\n Then I'd like you the next time you get very hungry to have another golf ball size of meat with a teaspoon of butter.\n\n Then, next time you get hungry, have about 8 ounces of vegetable juice.\n\n Next time you get hungry a golf ball of meat, next time an egg, then start the cycle over again.\n\n \r\nYou'll be going over that however many times you need to eat.\n\n You just keep going through that same pattern like, so however many times.\n\n \r\nFirst one is two golf ball sizes of meat a with a teaspoon of butter for the first two meat meals.\n\n After that, you skip the butter for the next golf size of meat and the egg, then the next time you'll have butter again.\n\n \r\nAbout 90% of your meat should be red, but you do need fish, some fish 10%.\n\n \r\nYou should be eating a pound of meat a day.\n\n If you're having 6 and 1/4 pounds of red meat a week, you should be having 3/4 pound of fish.\n\n\r\nCherries and cream would be good for you, cherries and butter would be even better.\n\n\r\n Juice ratio should be about 60% celery, 25% parsley, and 15% of zucchini, and maybe once in a while some cucumber.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Mini Consult One) \n \n \n \n \n### (7) Okay To Eat Less After Detox \n \n**[2001],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce in a while after you go through a detox, like a cold or a flu, it's okay to go once you're on the downside\n\n It might be able to go half a day or three quarter of a day without eating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSipping juice or a little milk, butter?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not the taste, just have no hunger.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIgnore it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

some enzyme and inhibitors in sprouts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat if you soak them in whey from when you make your cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI've not experimented with that?\n\n It's a possibility, I don't know that the lactic acid will incapacitate the enzyme inhibitors, the protein inhibitors, cuz they're pretty strong.\n\n \r\nI would have to do a test and see.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBecause aren't there a lot of the enzyme inhibitors in the walnuts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, like I say, they're in there, but I found that if I make that combination of the eggs, fat and the honey with it it neutralizes?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDoes it make a difference if you soak the almonds in pineapple juice.\n\n Is that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat'll cause most people gas, you're talking about high sugar food?\n\n Even though it has lots of acids in it, like the bromalin that will help break down the nuts to some extent, the high sugar in reaction with that particular kind of fat and high carbohydrate will cause indigestion, and gas in a lot of people, most people.\n\n I've never met anybody who could do it without farting all day long.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI would like to make a testimonial.\n\n I'm not farting since I'm on your diet.\n\n I just want everybody to know that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMost people don't.\n\n

trauma\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd everybody detoxes trauma hormones and you might go into that.\n\n Oh, I hate this guy because you had an incident with the guy before your father beat the shit out of you one time, and that neurological compound comes up.\n\n\r\nAll of a sudden, you're looking at some other man in your life and you're saying, I hate you

neurological tissue, um, are, are healed quicker by the ingestion of foul.\n\n Any white meat, um, with some fish is the white niche.\n\n Mm-hmm  but mainly foul rabbits, but we can't get them unless they've been fed off of pellets.\n\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Do you have questions.\n\n She's just listening?\n\n No question, Kimberly.\n\n Not yet.\n\n Okay.\n\n Do you have questions.\n\n What is your

Binds With Neurological Hormones \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhen you mentioned eating bread better in your book, was that before you kind of looked into the carbohydrates or is it okay to have some starch\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you know, when I read that research and then I started doing some experiments with it, it was always a trade off with a cooked starch?\n\n \r\nYou know, it's poisonous, there are byproducts in it.\n\n We're not going to handle it properly.\n\n We'll have to use tremendous amounts of nutrients to discard all of the waste and toxins that are involved in it, but I couldn't find any other starch that chelated with neurological toxins.\n\n  \r\nAnytime you have trauma or an upset in your life, there are hormones that are produced in the neurological system that are just like any other poison in the system, they will store and have to be detoxified.\n\n If you wanna know the particulars about that you can go on the internet and look for The Biology of Emotions by El Nora van Winkle.\n\n  \r\nShe was a biochemist that worked on neurological compounds for about 40 some years in New York city Medical University.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat was her name again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n⁠Elnora van Winkle, Biology of Emotions?\n\n She has the complex medical paper, and then a layman's paper for the average person to understand so you can read both or.\n\n  \r\nAnd she explains that when she was doing the tests and researching, she found neurological hormones that related to trauma, and they categorized them and differentiated them.\n\n \r\nAnd she found that people, when they go through an emotional upset that has no relationship to reality, that they're detoxing.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Celery \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI like the celery because it isn't extreme and it keeps the salt level\n\n So, it's like a constant IV sodium level in the body.\n\n It helps stimulate the adrenals and everybody needs some adrenaline, keep active and a lot of people who've been eating cooked foods for so long, have had lots of salt storages in their body and the high celery content helps detoxify that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Cheese With Vegetable Juice Bad \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nCream and butter\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou don't want to have cheese well, you can have cheese if you're getting nauseous, it's a sign you should have cheese, but cheese doesn't digest well because it's very acid, and then you mixed it with the alkaline juice?\n\n If you have the alkaline, and the acids together, neither will digest properly.\n\n \r\nSo, you're not going to digest as much juice if you have cheese with it.\n\n However, some people are so poisoned and get nauseous right away that they have to have cheese with their juice.\n\n But normally, no.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat does the avocado do.\n\n what are the properties of the fat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that's a different question from the juice?\n\n You can save that for that particular subject.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI rarely have time to make juice, so I but either this Essential Greens, or The Juice Evolution.\n\n I'm wondering that, or just going to Jamba Juice and they'll make celery and parsley.\n\n They won't make squash.\n\n They'll make cucumber.\n\n Should I.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, cucumbers a squash, summer squash?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, okay.\n\n Oh, so would that be preferable over buying the juice evolution if I can have fresh made.\n\n It's not organic either?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUm, yeah, it's better than having nothing because that's the only place we get our vitamin enzymes and mineral supplement, from the juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, but I'm saying to choose between the juice evolution or the one that they would make.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI would have both.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, the juice is really great.\n\n When I make it it's noticeably superior.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIncredible.\n\n Yes.\n\n Rich and alive.\n\n  \r\nIf you make it every once every three days.\n\n It's not that difficult.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI try, I just literally don't-  \r\n\n \r\nGet a high school kid to come over and do it.\n\n It's so easy.\n\n Just put up on the bulletin board, every three days, pay you 20 bucks.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Chicken Vs Fish Heals Tendons \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you're likely to get to a acidic after a while and maybe get a little irritable, maybe get depressed\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, the way to balance that is.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEat fish with it.\n\n Eat more chicken and fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have a hard time eating the fish raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMarinate it, lemon or lime.\n\n Let it sit for a couple of days in lemon or lime juice and it'll just soften just like it's cooked.\n\n\r\nIt won't be cooked in that way.\n\n You know, just like your hydrochloric acid dissolves the substances so that you can separate it, fractionate it, use the parts.\n\n Well, the lemon just does that for you ahead of time.\n\n Just easier to eat.\n\n It's much more palatable.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd, uh, I've been doing.\n\n Since I saw it, that's almost too much.\n\n I don't really know the information really.\n\n I'm still doing it.\n\n I dunno if I should keep doing it, or what do you think.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIs your shoulder better?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUm, still inflamed?\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nUhuh, then I would up to a cup, you said at a half a cup\r\n\n\r\nAnd there was no time limit on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou do it until it heals?\n\n Did you have surgery on that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n Yes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n It's likely they put Mercurochrome, which is mercury or merthiolate or some kind of iodine.\n\n They rub it on there as an antiseptic, and what that does is poison the tissue.\n\n So, until that is removed, proper healing may not take place without adhesions for up to 5 years.\n\n \r\nNo, I'm saying that if you don't do something properly it could last that long or even longer.\n\n Some people it could stay in there for a lifetime if they're not eating proper foods, but let's say.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\nThe reason I tell people to have green cabbage juice is because of the high vitamin K and vitamin U.\n\n It allows proper blood clotting so that an area can heal properly.\n\n But if you've got mercury or iodine in that area preventing new cells from regenerating, and aiding the area for healing, then the cabbage juice is going to help to an extent, but it's not going to change the tissue structure.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Chinese And Egpytian Royalty Only Ate Meat \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nUm, from my understanding of research of history of the Asian cultures the royalty, the dynasties only ate meats and fat\n\n They kept the lackies eating half or more carbohydrates like grains to keep them emotionally imbalanced because high carbohydrate causes a sugar problem in the body.\n\n \r\nAnd you can't keep up with that much advanced glycation end products.\n\n So, what they found was that emotionally they were unstable, and they would never overthrow the hierarchy and the Egyptians did it also.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, I was gonna say also more passive at the same time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, actually it makes them more irritable and violent.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo rice, you don't think creates passivity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Cilantro Only 10% For Metal Detox and Cream \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI'm just wondering if there are other things on the diet that are designed to attract metals as well\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCilantro is good for that.\n\n No more than 10% of the juice, but cilantro can do it very radically, and if you've got a lot of mercury coming out of your system or lead.\n\n You might get very fatigued, very poisoned, very nasty.\n\n Your mate won't like you very much if you can't handle it.\n\n  \r\nAnd if you're using a metal extractor like that, it's always good to have either some raw cows' cream or some coconut cream with it, so that as soon as the metals come into the blood, you'll have fat there to arrest it.\n\n  \r\nPeople who drink the juice and have heart palpitations afterwards or speedy heart.\n\n That's a sign that the metals have gotten into your blood, and you don't have the available blood fats to bind with it.\n\n So, the heart palpitations, don't let it frighten you, you just need to sit down, but if you're going to do that, then the first juice, if you have that side effect, then every juice in the morning should have some cream in it, so that, that doesn't happen.\n\n**[Atendee #2]**\n \r\nCan you eat butter just after it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nInstead of two tablespoons of cream or more, you could use one tablespoon of butter?\n\n**[Atendee #2]**\n \r\nAvocado.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAvocado won't work for that?\n\n Coconut cream, raw.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Concentrations Of Magnesium and Calcium \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike one of the highest concentrations of calcium and the magnesium is in meat\n\n It's most assemilable.\n\n \r\nJuice is okay in that area, but not as concentrated with meat, because for some reason, magnesium and calcium is better utilized in a concentration of fat that is animal based and protein.\n\n So, almost all of the minerals in meat, as long as the meat's not dehydrated or not cooked, 100% of the minerals can be utilized in cell tissue.\n\n\r\nAnd when you're eating raw foods like raw meats, you need very little calcium.\n\n Once you heat a food, you cauterized the minerals.\n\n That's like taking clay, which is normally malleable.\n\n Once you fire it, it is pottery.\n\n You cannot grow mold in it or plants in it anymore.\n\n It is dead, and that's the same thing with happens when you cook food.\n\n\r\nYou cauterized the minerals, the calcium rate of absorption is like down to 12%, 10 to 12% can be somewhat properly utilized.\n\n That means a loss of 88% of the calcium from cooking the meat.\n\n So, all this calcium loss is not because the soils are deficient it's because we're damaging the nutrients before we put 'em into our body and we can't utilize them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cultures That Eat Grains \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI mean, some healthy cultures ate grains\n\n Can we do that now, is it different than when they did that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHer question was, there are cultures that seem to be able to thrive by eating grains?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI meant partly grains in combination, they could have it in their diet, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe cultures who eat strictly grains are the unhealthiest cultures in the world?\n\n They're third world countries, you can see the children and their distended stomachs and their bones with extended stomachs.\n\n Those are cultures that only eat grain.\n\n It's a very malnourished culture.\n\n\r\nThose who mix like the Japanese and Chinese, uh, and eat lots of grains still is not a healthy thing because the human body can only handle about 7 - 8% advanced glycation end products.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Ecoli Prevents Tumors \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIn two to seven days\n\n University of Toronto has been using the Verotoxin produced by E coli to completely dissolve human brain tumors in 2 to 7 days, including the vessels going to the tumor.\n\n\r\n And they're telling us to to worry about E coli.\n\n I beg your pardon.\n\n\r\nThat's a cancer preventative?\n\n All animals eat fecal matter, except humans.\n\n I mean, civilized humans.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you need to eat it on this diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I do recommend it for people who have terminal cancer, and I've seen it turn it around?\n\n I've seen so many people go downhill and now if I can talk to them into eating some fecal matter.\n\n\r\nTurn it around.\n\n Turns around like crazy.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Eggs Pull Poisons To The Stomach & Vomiting \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nGood! You should vomit\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, what's the point of eating it then if I just chuck it up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou've seen those old labels, and remember when we were kids, it said if you swallow this poison, swallow an egg and induce vomiting.\n\n \r\nBecause eggs are great to pull poisons to the stomach like milk is, but eggs is pretty profound in doing it and it will cause you to vomit, but once you vomited, you got rid of it and then you can keep down the eggs, but you've gotta let yourself vomit if it's trying to.\n\n  \r\nBut usually, you only vomit like once and then you'll be able to eat for days, eat a lot of eggs, but vomiting is the quickest way to get rid of poisons.\n\n \r\nYou don't have to worry about diarrhea.\n\n You don't have to worry about loss of fluids, discharging the bile and the poisons easily.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSaves you a trip to the toilet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs*, yes.\n\n It also saves a lot of nutrients lost trying to keep it from destroying intestinal tissue as it passes out.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Fireplaces Polymers \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, this isn't really having anything to do with food, but I was wondering about like fireplaces and stuff like that\n\n If you're burning logs, and papers if that's gives off like toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt gives off a lot of carbon monoxide depending upon what you're burning?\n\n**[unclear]**\n there's heavy oils and there's a lot more tars as well as the carbon monoxide.\n\n\r\nChimney area should have a glass in front of it and have good circulation, so the smoke and gas doesn't come into the house.\n\n And most of the lawns are the firewood that they own.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA lot of them are treated.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat are they treated with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey treat it with substances, dried out, some kind of solvent?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd they don't necessarily have to say that.\n\n Like they don't- obviously it's all green?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you're not eating it.\n\n So yeah, no restrictions.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Goat Milk With BLood \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd who's butchering, when I can\n\n I do.\n\n And how do you do well, what I did on Pangai last year, I butchered a goat.\n\n So, what I did was made a harness for him and spun him from the tree until he went to sleep, and then I slit his jugular vein and caught the blood and put it in equal parts goats' milk and blood, and that tasted like milkshake.\n\n Believe it or not.\n\n  \r\nWe had five vegetarians there and 15 of us were raw animal meat eaters and the five vegetarians were so taken by the ceremony that we had cause we had drummers and we had two spinners to spin the animal around in the harness, hanging from the tree.\n\n \r\nAnd then I did a, kind of a hypnotic thing with the animal, so you go to sleep faster and they were very impressed by that.\n\n So, we had two-gallon jars full, equal parts of blood and goat milk and passed it around for everybody had a little bit.\n\n There was all these vegetarians going *impression*, they just wanted to be part of it, but they just hint about it.\n\n \r\nAnd every one of them, all of us, even, I was a little reluctant and it tasted like ice cream.\n\n It didn't have any relationship to what blood tastes like by itself.\n\n And it was just like ice cream.\n\n It was so rich.\n\n And with all these vegetarians, just going gulp, gulp, gulp like that.\n\n Those two gallons of milk and blood were gone in 15 minutes.\n\n \r\nAnd we only had 19 people, 20 minutes, all of two gallons of milk blood were gone.\n\n It's amazing.\n\n It's wonderful.\n\n But you know, everything gets killed.\n\n You kill vegetables, you kill anything you eat, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIf somebody wants to eat a strict vegetarian, can they still benefit from your diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, my diet isn't a vegetarian diet, but if somebody wants to eat a lot of fats, then they will definitely be helped?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIncluding the dairy and the eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe people who don't eat the meat won't regenerate.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Honey and INfants \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHamburger\n\n I was doing really well eating hamburger for a while, and the last week or two I had to like gag it down and so I tried to go to a different kind of meat \r\nDo you have any suggestions for helping with that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHow were you trying to eat it?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI was eating it with just butter and honey \r\n\n \r\nButter and honey?\n\n \r\nThat may detoxify the liver or spleen or gallbladder too quickly, and that may cause some nausea because when you put that combination like that, and the meat's almost in a pate, it's absorbed very readily, and it can cause instant detox.\n\n \r\nSo, when the body can detox, it'll dump into the stomach first and there's your nausea.\n\n So, if you eat some cheese with it, it'll probably prevent that.\n\n But you might want to eat some cheeses first, so it's already in your stomach and ready to absorb the toxins so you don't feel repulsed or don't have to experience the nausea and also tomatoes help relax that kind of a detoxification.\n\n \r\nSo, you might make a sauce with butter and tomato.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, what would a sauce with butter and tomato.\n\n How would you do that?\n\n Just butter, and tomato?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRoom temperature butter, room temperature tomatoes, they'll blend very well, even cheese?\n\n  \r\nYeah, in the blender, one of those little jars.\n\n \r\nAdd a little tomato, red onion.\n\n \r\nIngredients.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\ntomato \r\n\r\nbutter \r\n\r\ncheese \r\n\r\nred onion \r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Honey Butter Pate Nasuea = Eat Cheese \n \n**[2005]**\n \r\nQuestion about honey and infants\n\n They say not to feed them honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, there are several reasons that they don't like to feed honey to infants.\n\n Most honey's heated to high temperatures.\n\n So, when the bee collects the nectar, swallows it, and he manufactures an insulin like substance, it converts the nectar into honey.\n\n Then he gets back to the hive, they vomit it.\n\n \r\nSo, honey is bee puke.\n\n Basically, is what it is, but it has an insulin like substance, which converts 90% of the carbohydrate in it into enzymes for digesting, utilizing, and assembling proteins and only 10% sugar.\n\n Once you heat it up to 100°, between 93° and 100° degrees, you alter and destroy that insulin-like substance.\n\n \r\nSo, then it's back into sugar.\n\n It's not a radical sugar until you take it over 104° and most honeys are heated at minimum of 118°.\n\n So, if an infant has that they'll have a sugar problem, it could cause anaphylaxis.\n\n Also, they worry about bacteria in honey, which is the most absurd thing because bacteria cannot thrive in honey \r\nIn fact, they say that these, the people who've done the testing experiments have said that it's absolutely impossible to get bacteria to thrive and even sustain itself in honey.\n\n So, it's the anaphylactic children/infants will have from the high sugar of heated honeys, but it doesn't happen with unheated honeys.\n\n  \r\nUnheated below 93°.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Honey Can Cause Detox \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhatever you like to spice it up\n\n Also having the honey with it may cause too much detoxification if you're having it too often.\n\n So, you might want to cut back on the honey with your meat meal for a while, and just skip it sometimes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat kind of ratio would you suggest, would you say a few cherry tomatoes with three tablespoons of butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt doesn't matter how many tomatoes you eat as long as you are still have room for your meat.\n\n You can have as many as you like, as long as it doesn't spoil your appetite.\n\n In fact, usually let's say you had a handful of cherry tomatoes with a half a pound of meat.\n\n \r\nIt's easier to eat the half a pound of meat with the handful of cherry tomatoes than it is to get to meat down by itself.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Honey Must Be Under 93 Deg \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUnheated, honey, yeah\n\n Only 10% will be used as sugar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's the other 90%.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEnzymes for digesting, utilizing, and assimilating protein?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) How Long Without Juice \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou know, eating meat on a daily basis\n\n I can go more no more than let's say 4 days without juice, and I start breaking out as you see.\n\n I've gone four days without juice.\n\n I'm starting to break out instantly on the fourth day, but that's cause I had a vagotomy, which means they severed all the vagus nerve to my stomach.\n\n\r\nSo, acids still refluxes into my mouth.\n\n For me, I still have to have juices frequently.\n\n \r\nAnd most people, especially starting the diet are gonna be highly acidic because when they detox, the poisons get into the blood and of course they get into the tissues.\n\n If you have the vegetable juice there, it'll alkalinize that, it'll have lots of alkalinizing minerals to bind with those poisons, and then the end result will still be alkalinity, instead of acidity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) How To Get Rid Of Anger \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThese hormones\n\n She was a person who believed in primal therapy, which means you scream, you rant, you rave, and you kick pillows.\n\n You beat things to death, except for humans.\n\n But when I used to exercise primal therapy, It only continued the rage.\n\n \r\nSo, I decided to do the opposite.\n\n Whenever I felt rage, I would go paint or smell flowers, or do gardening, sing, do everything that was pretty and nice rather than violent.\n\n\r\nAnd I found that I was able to change myself that way.\n\n So, she and I had quite a disagreement, but she was still in her anger.\n\n She did my diet for about two years and then thought that instincto was better.\n\n And instinctive means you eat what's attracted to you, and she was 70 years old at the time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Humans Can Only Handle 8% AGES and Store 70% \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nConcentrations of byproduct of advanced glycation end product\n\n Anytime the body uses glycogen as fuel, there's a byproduct called advanced glycation end product, and Columbia University in New York city did the research on it for about 28 years, 28 to 30 years, and found that in a healthy body, it stores at a rate 70% every time you eat a carb.\n\n  \r\nThat means it stays in your body to your lifetime, 70% of that toxicity.\n\n if you're unhealthy, like somebody with a compromised kidney or diabetes, it stores the rate of 90% or more.\n\n \r\nThat is a sugar product that actually melts tissue when it becomes so concentrated.\n\n Like Coca-Cola.\n\n \r\nSo, that's why a flesh in muscle starts sagging, cause it fills up and starts melting the tissues.\n\n That cannot be removed.\n\n We are humans that have just lived that way.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Milk and Lactobacillus \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nTheir marketing tool\n\n It has nothing to do with the human body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, we didn't really have that in there.\n\n**[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n \r\nWell, there's lactobacillus, acidophilus, \n and bulgaricus in raw milk?\n\n That's what raw milk is for, it's to get the bacterial environment going in animal.\n\n That's what milk is for.\n\n \r\nI use milk because I found that it relaxes a toxic system that is so toxic as a human from eating so much cooked food and all the pollution.\n\n When I try to not use dairy, people have much more difficulty with relaxation, ease of diet.\n\n It's difficult to get rid of their cravings.\n\n It's much more difficult.\n\n \r\nMilk.\n\n Raw milk is just like a drug, it's very helpful.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Milk Draws Poisons \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLet's say a scorpion bite or a tarantula bite or a snake bite\n\n It was poisonous.\n\n If they had a lactating animal, they raised goats, they had goats' milk.\n\n If they had a lactating animal, they would drink the milk rather than cut and suck because the milk will draw the poison to the stomach and then they vomit.\n\n \r\nIt worked so easily.\n\n It was miraculous.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much would you drink.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey'd drank about a cup?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, really.\n\n That little?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs that because of the cream.\n\n Do you need to have both the milk, and the cream?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe cream will work to bring the poisons to the stomach?\n\n It has to do with the combination of the lactic acids and the sugars and the proteins and the fats all together.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Minerals From Cheese & Vegetable Juice \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFor any purpose because it's bioactive\n\n Minerals from cheese cannot be utilized that way because once it's dried and cultured, it is a good detoxifier.\n\n It absorbs, but it really can't be absorbed into the cells easily because it's no longer a bio-actively electrolyte bound.\n\n \r\nAnd electrolytes have to be present.\n\n Ions have to be present within the nutrients in order for the cell to absorb it, each cell has one or two ions in it and that's its guts.\n\n When it needs to eat, it'll attract a mineral as it passes in the blood serum.\n\n And so, it opens and the one or two ions inside will attract the ions that are bound with that mineral and the mineral attached to a food nutrient, whether it's protein, H2O like sodium usually carries H2O, potassium may carry glycogen.\n\n Whether the glycogen is made from pyruvate or carbohydrate.\n\n  \r\nJust different minerals will carry different nutrients with it.\n\n So, when the cell wants to eat that it opens up and attracts it.\n\n If the ions aren't active, there's no magnetic force.\n\n So, it can't be utilized and absorb properly.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Parsley \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe parsley I use because of the high vitamin D in it, vitamin E and the high chlorophyll content, which helps people utilize oxygen better\n\n And it's very good at alkalinizing the blood that becomes so acidic when you detox constantly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIsn't it high in zinc as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends upon where it's grown?\n\n\r\nThe thing that's highest in zinc is zucchini.\n\n No matter what soil it's grown, that's why I use the zucchini to help pull out toxic metals.\n\n \r\nAll the summer squash help do that.\n\n They've got a starch in them that has a tendency to attract metals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre there different metals for different starches.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, actually all of your summer squashes will attract any of them?\n\n So will the winter squashes, but then you get a sugar high from all the high carbohydrate content and that's not good.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Recommended Juicers, Oxygen Destroys Nutrients \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, directly from Tribest because they just had the show up in Anaheim\n\n Until the end of this month, they're running them wholesale is about 340.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, that's pretty good.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan you arrange them for us.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm a distributor?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGive me your name and number because I send people to Ferns, and another place know that's even cheaper in Beverly Hills get cheaper.\n\n 380 something.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWe got Norwalk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, Norwalk's have two processes and they're $2,600, something like that.\n\n\r\nAd they tri-trate, means they masticate, break it down, then you have to press it.\n\n So, it touches oxygen twice.\n\n So, the juice isn't as good and doesn't last as long.\n\n And the green light, green power and green star, it's all pressed, it's crushed and pressed rather than tri-trated and pressed.\n\n So, there's not a lot of oxygen that destroys it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's the use of the magnet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat it does is it frees up some of the minerals that's in the pulp and it goes with the juice, rather than staying in the pulp?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI've also heard documents that it reduces the surface tension in the juice.\n\n So, it's more permeable in the cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's said that's the same thing I was saying, but you said it a different way.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Starch & Nut Formula \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, I worked very hard at finding something I could use to substitute for that cooked starch with the raw fat to bind with those neurological toxins\n\n Nuts was my best shot, but I couldn't get rid of the enzyme inhibitors that would prevent digestion of protein for 20-48 hours after eating the nuts, and that's not just the protein in the nuts.\n\n \r\nThat's the protein in any food you eat after that, whether it be eggs or, or meat it just wouldn't digest properly.\n\n So, I started thinking about what could I neutralize these enzyme inhibitors with.\n\n How could I inhibit the enzyme inhibitors, turn it right back on them?\n\n  \r\nSo, I found that when I mixed- I mixed quite a few things to try to work it out, and finally, when I mixed eggs, honey, and a fat with it, whether it was butter, coconut cream, peanut oil, olive oil, some compound with it, some fat with it.\n\n It worked and you only had to take it one day a week and it would work for the whole week.\n\n \r\nSo, I used the nut formula in combination.\n\n The nut formula is nuts, egg, a fat and honey.\n\n It has to be a lot of honey for.\n\n**[unclear]**\n for some people who have a good liver, and pumpkin seeds for those few who have a good liver and sunflower seeds.\n\n \r\nSo, the easiest to digest are walnuts and pecans.\n\n The next are pine nuts and sunflower seeds.\n\n However, the pine nuts can cause intense glandular detoxification and nausea.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Summer Squash \n \n**[2002],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nShe asked if there was any time that the winter squashes would be good to eat\n\n \r\nYes.\n\n You could have it up to 10% of your juices.\n\n Like with carrot juice just to increase the vitamin a content.\n\n**[I'm not sure if he ever increased the carrot ratio]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Three Grains Of Salt \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nConcentrate like salt in the blood\n\n Let's say you have three little bitty grains of salt.\n\n  \r\nIn a body about 5' 8'', about 140 pounds.\n\n You will increase the concentration of sodium molecules in the blood to where they clump in about four to five in a clump.\n\n  \r\nSo, what happens when the cell opens to eat H20.\n\n It'll try to pull that sodium cluster into itself and it can't do it?\n\n What happens is the magnetism is so great outside that it pulls the ions, which means it pulls the guts out of the cell and the cells can never eat anything again.\n\n So, it shrivels like a raisin and dies.\n\n And one little grain of salt will destroy 1 million red blood cells that way from clumping, clustering.\n\n \r\nYou won't even see it, it's about head of a pin but still you have a lot of it over and over 50, 60 years.\n\n That's a lot of destroyed red blood cells.\n\n**[Frank],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIs there any feedback as to whether it kills the cells that are basically supposed to die or that are weak, or does it do it- \r\n\n \r\nKill any one that opens to eat, whether it's healthy or not.\n\n \r\nIt's just like, if you have your mouth open and I'm passing around poison and you're the healthiest person here, guess what's gonna happen to you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWatch out, Frank?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Too Much Fruit \n \n \n \n \n### (32) Vaccines Crippled Client, Vomit \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVaccines, and the thimerosal, which is mercury poisons the system\n\n So, he's like this now *imitation* in a chair and he's 18 years old.\n\n He's been that way since 18 months.\n\n So, I've had him on a diet for about six weeks.\n\n He's put on, 12 pounds for the first time in six years he'd put on weight.\n\n And for the first time, since he was 18 months, His feet that were bound like that relaxed.\n\n\r\nThis kid was going to vomit.\n\n\r\nI knew that cause if he got the mercury that went right to his nervous system like that and caused that kind of deformity then it's close to the surface.\n\n He would be likely to vomit.\n\n So I had to warn the parents that he's going to probably vomit profusely for an evening, and then he'll be able to eat for three days without vomiting anything, and then he may go into it again and like clockwork, that's the way it went.\n\n First time he vomited all evening, and the next day he ate three pounds of meat the next day and the next day, and the next day.\n\n For 10 days, he ate three pounds of meat a day and about 10 eggs, lots of milk.\n\n \r\nThis is a skinny kid that's only about 5' 8'' and 110 pounds, pretty thin.\n\n So, eating all that food, very happy.\n\n So, in just a matter of six weeks, he's improved probably by about 5% - 7%.\n\n He hadn't improved anything since he was 18 months old.\n\n So, the father and mother are pretty impressed.\n\n The foods are incredible.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Vegetable Juice Only 5% Herbs \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou generally give everybody the same parsley, celery, summer squash\n\n \r\nSo, it's like three or whatever juices and that's pretty much it as I understand it.\n\n Why not- there's a zillion vegetables out there.\n\n Why just those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause the others are more herbal, and they're stronger and they will have greater reactions?\n\n\r\nFor instance, let's say with Kimberly, I used a little bit of cauliflower and broccoli.\n\n Now if you use too you use too much of that.\n\n It'll make the thyroid slower, and that can cause lethargy tiredness, and some people need that just to slow them down.\n\n So, I use others in small amounts and you can use any one you want, just know what it's for and no more than 5% of your juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo is there a way to find out what they're for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are lots of verbal books around that have that in it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about adding kale and other greens.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said, no more than 5% because they're very concentrated?\n\n If you are having that 4 times a day, you can be causing yourself to go quite a radical direction.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Vegetables and Fiber Constipates \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThere's cruciferous vegetables that are so healthy for you\n\n That's a problem.\n\n The cruciferous vegetables that are so healthy for you is a problem, And that's the problem.\n\n I thought how can you go to work or anywhere if you are eating a lot of this or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, we're not, we're not made to digest that.\n\n \r\nThey will cause gas.\n\n What do you eat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat do you eat with it to counter the effect of it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou don't, you have vegetable juice, vegetable juice is what you have, so you're not having whole vegetables?\n\n Let's say you have a salad, you could eat some avocado with it, that would reduce the gas.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, basically cause either whether it's cooked or not, it's the cauliflower, the broccoli, the- \r\n\n \r\nThey'll cause gas with or without being cooked.\n\n We're not meant to digest them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThe healthiest vegetables are the worst.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRight, but you can have them as juice, you don't need the fiber?\n\n If you're an all-raw diet, meat diet.\n\n You don't need any fiber.\n\n \r\nFiber is there for people who eat cooked foods because the foods have no vitamins and enzymes to properly digest.\n\n Peristalsis is reduced by 2/3.\n\n So, the food doesn't move it petrifies, especially meats when they're cooked.\n\n So, what happens is you eat vegetables with it, to help get some vitamins and enzymes and broom it through.\n\n \r\nBut on a raw diet, whole vegetables will constipate you.\n\n They'll create the opposite effect because what happens is, an herbivore has a digestive tract 2.\n\n5x longer than ours.\n\n They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to obtain fats and proteins.\n\n They have 2 to 4 stomachs.\n\n We have one.\n\n  \r\nSo, what happens is we digest only a third of the vegetables, and that's mainly juice for the vitamins and enzymes and minerals.\n\n So, what happens is by the time it gets down to the colon, it's still producing the alkalinity.\n\n The bowel has to be entirely acid or the E coli won't feed on the fecal matter, and then we get constipated.\n\n  \r\nOn a diet like this, like all carnivores, they don't eat fiber, yet they move all the time.\n\n Unless they eat vegetables, feed them vegetables, it prevents the bacteria from feeding on the fecal matter and sponging it out.\n\n A normal bowel movement for a human being should be 60% to 80% bacteria, mainly E coli.\n\n That swells it up and sponges it, the byproducts of that are B vitamins and amino acids and the Verotoxin, which shrinks tumors.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Vegetarians Don't Replicate Cells \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe problem I find with vegetarians, especially long-term vegetarians is that they don't reproduce cells cause they don't get enough protein\n\n So, what happens.\n\n They hold onto dead cells?\n\n So, they just go through life holding on to dead cells and not getting more alive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo how about the Indian populations that have been predominantly vegetarian.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, same thing for them?\n\n I've seen it time after time.\n\n They're more acclimated to it.\n\n The tribes like the Fulani, and the Samburu mainly live on raw milk.\n\n I mean, 90%.\n\n of the Fulani is raw milk.\n\n 90% of their diet is raw milk, but because they've been on it for centuries it's fine for them.\n\n \r\nThey do have some skin discoloration that I find predominant in people who eat mainly raw milk, but there's no ill health associated with it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Weight Gain Lots Of Fat Vs Meat & Thin People \n \n**[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI'm eating about a container and a half of red meat, and I was having it twice a day, but to gain the weight- \r\n\n \r\nYou have to have lots of fat with your meat if you want to gain weight, otherwise you just gonna burn it\n\n \r\nLet me give you an example.\n\n I have a fellow who's on the diet's, been on the diet for 2 years, maybe a little over 2 years.\n\n And he decided, he's doing well on the diet now, he was very thin before and gained about 40 pounds.\n\n He's about 6' 2'', and he just decided he was ready to move to the next level.\n\n \r\nSo, he said, \"I'd like to work out.\n\n I'd like the bodybuild.\n\n Is there something I can do.\n\n\" And I said, \"Well, have a lubrication formula every time you eat meat or an equal amount of butter and some kind of sauce\"?\n\n So, at least 1/2 a cup - 3/4 of a cup of butter with each meat meal, this is a big guy.\n\n \r\nIn two and a half months, he put 6 inches on his chest and 4 inches on his arms and everybody accused him of using steroids.\n\n So, you just have to add a lot of fat.\n\n It has to be a lot of fat if you want build.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI like the lube formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can have as many as you like, just every time you eat meat have one, and then you put on more weight.\n\n How long, how many pounds have you put on.\n\n You put on what, about 7, 10?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, that's it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs it okay to have a lube formula whenever you feel hungry too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, well, it's good to have it once a day by itself if you want, but it's always good to have more protein?\n\n \r\nYou know, if you're gonna have lots of lube formulas you need lots of protein.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, that could detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's just like anything?\n\n If you have more carbohydrate or fats than you do protein, you're gonna become protein deficient.\n\n If you have too many carbohydrates, you're going to de mineralize yourself.\n\n \r\nYou'll have tooth problems, bone problems, and just neurological pain.\n\n Everything will increase that's painful will be exaggerated, increased.\n\n And if you eat lots of fat, you'll feel better and all that, but you're not gonna put on massive muscle.\n\n You're not gonna put on muscle mass.\n\n \r\nYou'll put on fat mass, which is good because it will protect you, and it binds.\n\n All people who are fat, it's completely opposite from the medical profession.\n\n All people who are fat are healthier than people who are thin, cuz people who are fat have storages of fat that bind with the poisons that are in their systems.\n\n People who are thin, those poisons get into the tissue and damage the tissue.\n\n \r\nAnd I used to think just the opposite, especially when I was a vegetarian.\n\n Anybody who was fat was unhealthier than anybody who was bone thin.\n\n And then when I started doing laboratory experiments and tests, I found that the tissue in people who were thin was highly contaminated.\n\n They would injury easier, they were unhappier, they were more irritable.\n\n There were all kinds of side effects.\n\n Whereas the person who was fat usually had very few problems because they had the fat to down with the toxins.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nFat and happy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFat and happy.\n\n yeah.\n\n So, I started getting fat as soon as I realized that.\n\n  \r\nOf course, I can't get very fat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

I'm going for 30 days, I'd take 15 pounds of butter with me.\n\n \r\nI keep it in a cooler and I always get a room with a refrigerator and I take out all the soda pops and beers and alcohol and put my butter and cheese in there.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut you have every temperature- \r\n\n \r\nSometimes.\n\n Oh yeah, definitely.\n\n The butter I'm eating is room temperature, always.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou have to have to go through the scanner though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't have a problem in Asia?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut if you're going from LA.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm able to get through again?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThe trick that I've learned Kathy is if you ship it to yourself, because I've done it three or four times, I actually ship it to myself.\n\n I send it through FedEx, UPS, DHL, and it's there before I get there.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWherever hotel you go to, they hold it for you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhen I went to Hawaii, it was sitting on my front doorstep at my house that I had rented in a cooler?\n\n I shipped it to myself in a cooler, it was cold when I arrived.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut the only thing you don't take any food you on the plane.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I do because I'm getting them to hand check it again?\n\n  \r\nFor a 6-month period they were jerks, but most of the places I went, my patients always had food for me.\n\n I'd always have something on the plane.\n\n If I'm going to Fort Lauderdale, West Palm beach or I'm going New York city, and it was a four and a half, five-hour flight.\n\n I want something on the plane.\n\n So, if they wouldn't hand check it without scanning it.\n\n I'd stand there, eat a half a dozen raw eggs in front of them and the raw meat.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nAnd they threatened to have me arrested because I was gonna cause harm and damage, give them same kind of disease.\n\n They called the police and the police come, I'd say, \"You ticket and arrest me for this.\n\n How's this going to look in court.\n\n I'm just eating food?\n\n You are going to arrest me for eating food.\n\n\" And this is a public place.\n\n So, they back off, so I just stand there and eat it front of them.\n\n Just change their minds a little bit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt won't go through radiation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt does, but because I have a radiation therapy, it causes more of a reaction for me?\n\n If most people just put it through the hand scanner, you walk through the carry on.\n\n It's not gonna be that bad if it only goes through one time.\n\n But we can't do which pardon.\n\n \r\nYou have to put your bags on this one little scanner, that's low-level radiation?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBags, keys, wallet.\n\n They make you take everything, surprised they don't strip clean, you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the last time I didn't know when I was gonna get in San Francisco?\n\n So, I had meat in plastic in my pocket, they hand checked it for me.\n\n \r\nSo, I just had that stuff in my pocket.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Air Filters \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you ever looked into air cleaners\n\n Are they effective at all?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, they're very good?\n\n The HEPA's are of course the best.\n\n I used to use the Alpine when I didn't live in Malibu where the air is clean.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Alkaline, Bad Breath \n \n**[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOn the raw diet, I still have bad breath\r\n\n\r\nIt's from the toxicity in your intestines gassing into your lungs and causing that smell\n\n\r\nUnless you have a dental problem.\n\n\r\nThat's all hogwash.\n\n \r\nAll the tests will prove that that's inconsistent.\n\n You've got lots of people with an alkaline mouth that have terrible breath.\n\n\r\nWhen I was around fruitarians, terrible breath.\n\n Because their teeth would rot like crazy.\n\n Everything was over alkaline: alkaline urine, alkaline salivary gland, alkaline feces.\n\n \r\nYou're not ever supposed to have alkaline feces, you're not supposed to have alkaline urine, you're not supposed to have alkaline salivary glands.\n\n Everything should be acid.\n\n The only thing that should be on an even keel should be your blood \r\nYou're enzyme deficient and that's the honey.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Animal Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAll the tribes that eat meat, lots of lard and lots of animal fats have no heart disease and have no arterial sclerosis\n\n None, zip.\n\n Even the ones who eat it cooked, only cooked meat, only cooked fat, no heart disease, no arterial sclerosis.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you barbeque and cook something, that's not carcinogenic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm not talking about carcinogens?\n\n Carcinogen means cancer producing.\n\n I'm talking about something that produces hardening of the arteries, and hardening of the heart tissue, causes it to become brittle.\n\n \r\nCooking meat doesn't cause that problem.\n\n The tribes who eat cooked meat have gout, they have arthritis, they have a lot of joint problems, but they don't have arterial  sclerosis, no heart disease.\n\n \r\nVegetable oils cause that because we have low body temperature, we also have 60,000 times less enzymes to disassemble the fat molecule properly.\n\n A cow keeps their body temperature 100° - 101°.\n\n\r\nVegetable oils at that temperature, as part of that animal will stay fluid its entire life.\n\n If a human eats it, and we make cells with that kind of fat for lubrication and stability and protection, it will crystalize in the heart.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) APplying Raw Meat & Honey On Skin Topically \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, first of all, I usually start with something I've been experimenting with\n\n \r\nFor the last six months.\n\n I've been experimenting with using honey to get rid of wrinkles and lines.\n\n Before that I spent a year using raw meat, and I found the raw meat helps get rid of bruising and soreness easier, and it does help you get rid of wrinkles.\n\n \r\nApplying it to your skin, topically, yes.\n\n\r\nWhen I was in Asia the last time, I got back about four weeks ago, it wasn't convenient to use meat cause I was with a girlfriend.\n\n So, I started getting honey and the honey started breaking down- I don't know if anybody remembers how deep my lines were here.\n\n \r\nThis is only about two weeks off and on using it on my forehead.\n\n It just peels the layers away, very thick.\n\n And the comb honey is the best to do it for some reason.\n\n \r\nThe honey in the comb seems to be more active.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do we do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, James carries it?\n\n I buy mine from Honey Pacifica.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJohn is the only person I know that that cuts it, and doesn't eat it at all.\n\n \r\nIt's Aajonus' friend so you're guaranteed obviously to know the honey's not heated.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt still does work, even if it has been heated, it still works better than the honey that's been extracted already.\n\n There's something that's a little bit more powerful about the comb.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nHow much faster, how much more effective.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, your neck?\n\n I had him do it for 10 days.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOne and a half weeks?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf anybody saw his neck two weeks ago, looked like a lizard's neck, lots and lots of layers, and this is just 10 days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt does look better by the way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat I suggest you do cause you have the ptyalin enzyme in the saliva, put saliva on it first and then just put your finger in and rub it in.\n\n\r\nSaliva helps break it down.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Bad Food \n \n \n \n \n### (7) Bath Ingredients \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n2 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar \r\n2 tablespoons of sun dried sea salt\r\n2 - 3 tablespoons of coconut cream (optional for skin) \r\n\r\nCause when you're in the bathtub that long, your skin gets dry\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCoconut cream or coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut cream, when you get out it just makes the skin nice and protected, so it doesn't dry?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Bath Ingredients Again and When To Do \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\n3 table spoons of apple cider vinegar \r\n\r\n2 - 3 cups of raw milk \r\n\r\n2 tablespoons of sea salt \r\n\r\n2 -3 tablespoons of coconut cream\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs it a hot bath, like a certain type.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's a hot bath from 102° - 105° for a minimum of 45 minutes, we work it up to an hour, and then over a year, we work it up to an hour and a half?\n\n  \r\nWhen you get out of the bath, you have to move like a snail.\n\n Otherwise, you'll pass out.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to get out of the bath, dry slooowly, and get some long underwear.\n\n**[No longer available]**\n https://www.\n\nappleseeds.\n\ncom/content/wintersilks has a long underwear that's made of wool and silk, they are thin that they keep you very warm.\n\n Put that on, clothes on top of that.\n\n I don't care if you look like an old person out there walking this slow, you just need to walk for 45 minutes.\n\n \r\n[No longer recommended because people were unable to do the walks.\n\n Also, there is benefit to staying inside with warm clothes and in a warm room sweating] \r\nAnd then when you get back, take a nap.\n\n These baths should ideally be done between 1:30 and 4:30 in the afternoon.\n\n You do em in the morning, your whole day's gonna be imbalanced.\n\n If you do it at night, you may not sleep.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Baths For Lymphatic Congestion \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why I have people doing baths if they have lymphatic congestion\n\n \r\nTo get rid of those toxic oils, they have to stay in a bath for 45 minutes to an hour and a half at a time every 3 - 4 days.\n\n, not any less than that.\n\n What it does is it causes a slow melting of the lymphatic system, and then they have to eat a particular mixture of coconut cream and pineapple right before they get in the bath and then they have to take a walk heavily clothed with long underwear to make sure that the lymph system keeps moving and the pineapple and coconut get into that fat to prevent it from hardening as much again.\n\n If you do it slowly on this diet, it's gonna take you 40 years to get rid of all that fat.\n\n\r\nIf you do the baths, you can get rid of it in 10 to 15.\n\n It's a long process.\n\n \r\n[Walk isn't necessarily recommended because people were unable to do it.\n\n If you can do it, that's great, but there are benefits to skipping it.\n\n Such as, staying warm in a hot room]\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Body Starves After 5 Hours \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNow I'm gonna repeat that\n\n Your body starts of protein after five hours, do not go five hours without eating something.\n\n Egg, milk; something with protein, meat.\n\n So, if you go to sleep and it takes you 15 minutes to go to sleep, you set your alarm for five hours and 15 minutes, you wake, you have a milkshake in a small amount, or a couple of eggs rocky style or some milk a little cream and honey in it and go right back to sleep.\n\n When people sleep through that five-hour period, the red blood cells start to become cannibalistic.\n\n They eat each other, highly toxic.\n\n That's why people wake up after 8 to 10 hours, they go for the coffee because they can't move cause the blood is so acidic and toxic.\n\n  \r\nSo, you wake up after five hours, eat something and go back to sleep.\n\n Right.\n\n Then you wake up with all kinds of energy, let me give you an example.\n\n  \r\nI go to Nevada city once a year to do my workshop person.\n\n One of the people who put it on there, John Fo.\n\n Been going there three years at that point, it happened two years ago.\n\n \r\nWhen I first saw him, he was like this *imitation*, he was only 42 years ago.\n\n Old man, chronic fatigue, slouching weak, mainly a vegetarian at that point for a long time.\n\n  \r\nAnd put him on the diet, three years later, strong, healthy, robust, fine.\n\n But he says \"10, 11 o'clock before I feel any energy.\n\n So sluggish in the morning\".\n\n I said, \"Are you waiting after five hours and eating something\".\n\n \"No\"?\n\n I say it every time I go to those lectures.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Caffeine \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThe raw cacao made me really crazy cause I'm really sensitive to caffeine and that other chemical that's in chocolate\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTheobromine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, I'm really, really sensitive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOne time when David Wolf came out of it, I thought I know better to do this, but I did it anyway because I wanted to experiment.\n\n \r\nI did not sleep for 48 hours, I wanted to fuck everything sight, and I wanted to run a marathon.\n\n It was terrible.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nAnd when David Wolf went to Pangea in Hawaii, he convinced everybody to go on the chocolate and now they've all become chocoholics.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI called them three days after David was there and everything was just falling apart.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nWait a minute, I just wanna say something.\n\n I watched a man's emotional state, the man who runs the Pangea, Denise, changed so dramatically that when I had just been there three months earlier, and then I talked to him, he was literally had become a literal devotee of David Wolf to the point of arguing with me, and he was never like that before.\n\n And it was the chocolate that was doing it, he didn't even realize it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd they have a book out.\n\n I tried it myself.\n\n I mean, I shopped there before when I was a fruitarian, I took just a couple, and I felt really great cause like a high.\n\n \r\nBut it doesn't last, unfortunately.\n\n You can live that way forever, be perfect, but you come right down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHeadaches.\n\n I was not a nice kid.\n\n Can I just have that too.\n\n Yeah?\n\n And I made a chocolate with it.\n\n I put it with honey and lots of butter cause I knew what it would do to me if I had it by itself.\n\n \r\nSo, I flowered it, made a, a chocolate out of it with lots of butter, and some honey, even cream.\n\n So, I had it buffered.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cant Eat Red Meat, Over Acidic \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nA month ago, I couldn't look at beef\n\n  \r\nI've been on the diet for nine months and all of a sudden beef looked like yuck.\n\n I can't eat it.\n\n Why is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe asked, she'd been on the diet about nine months and all of a sudden, she could not can't stand red meat, but she asked why?\n\n Usually, it's because the blood's getting too acidic when you eat the red meat, so you need to start eating it with white meat.\n\n So, white meat with the red meat will change that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAt the same time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAt the same time, especially seafood, fish will allow it to alter your desire quicker than eating chicken or any other kind of fowl?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIsn't it also sometimes people not drinking enough green juice to balance out the, alkalinity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, are you drinking your green juice?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'm not every single day, but about 5 days a week?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat should be fine.\n\n It's usually just the acidity of the red meat.\n\n Sometimes what will happen is when you have a lot of red meat, the body will start detoxing the liver.\n\n \r\nWhen that happens, the blood gets overly acidic and it will just keep doing it, and doing and doing it.\n\n For some reason, even though liver is very concentrated in protein, it doesn't happen with liver.\n\n If it's happening, you need some seafood.\n\n It could be oysters.\n\n It can be.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Carrot Juice + Coco Cream For Eyes, Detox At Night \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nQuestion on the coconut cream with the carrot juice\n\n Can you substitute coconut water with the coconut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n See this tin lid.\n\n If I put coconut cream on this, in about an hour it will turn gray?\n\n It rips metals up that quickly.\n\n If I put coconut oil or olive oil or flax oil or any other pressed oil on here, it would take two to three days to the same thing.\n\n \r\nCoconut cream will get in and there and rip things apart very rapidly because there's lots of bacteria that does not translate and transfer into the oil.\n\n So, without those, it's not going to be a cleanser of that type.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNow, obviously it has to be raw coconut cream, otherwise it's not gonna do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCorrect?\n\n Your bacteria and enzymes are destroyed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes cream from an animal do the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCream from an animal, no?\n\n If I put cream on that it will take about two days to start turning, pulling out the metal.\n\n \r\nThe carrot juice and coconut cream for the eyes should be done between 4:30PM - 6:30PM.\n\n Your eyes detoxify right before you go to sleep, somewhere between 9:00PM - 11:00PM.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Corrections In The Diet \n \n**[2005],[Jim]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhile setting up the website, I got a little preview of the upcoming new book and regarding mental clarity, you talked about a couple additives for the juice, but also there's something about this you wouldn't know, and I've never seen that anywhere\n\n I don't know if it was a typo.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it was for a certain situation, specific towards that condition?\n\n\r\nI also have eggs with vegetable juice for specific diseases.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nSo, it also be for a limited time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about bread.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd I'm specific about it?\n\n Why do this, why you have it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe only see what we want to see.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's four pages that have changed.\n\n I let an editor go through the book and they changed- my mother's name went to Dorse, instead of Doris.\n\n My father's name, Josef went to Joseph and multiply went to multiple.\n\n\r\nAnd the order form got missed off from your website.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou have to read that entire book in every word every time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI have to read it at least 20 times?\n\n First time I read it 86 times.\n\n \r\nThey go it through it and make mistakes.\n\n\r\nAnd I'm sure that there's another 20 I didn't catch.\n\n So, I've got four pages to change.\n\n 31, 32, 34 and 362\r\nMental clarity is a relative thing.\n\n You get some, you want some more, it's like money.\n\n Oh yes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yes, everything you feel better.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Cows Better Than Goats For Bath Cuz Cream \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCows milk, goats milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhole cows milk is always better for the cream?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it better cultured or not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you like sour smelling skin, it's up to you?\n\n Doesn't make a difference.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cream WIth Milk For Candida \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nJust give her eggs by themselves\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do I get rid of my itching.\n\n Is milk causing or aggravating that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you need to add cream to your milk?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAlways add cream or butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAlways add cream or butter too?\n\n  \r\nI always add cream or butter to my milky.\n\n  \r\nSo, you may be throwing off all the sugars that you've got collected from being a fruitarian.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, just keep going.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUntil you get the fat on you?\n\n When you get enough fat on you the fat will start absorbing and stop throwing it off through the skin and causing drying to the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRaw milk is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRaw milk is wonderful?\n\n It's not gonna add candida, it's gonna get rid of candida, but you've got to put added cream to it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd no more than 5 days to become kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you're in the winter time and it takes five days to become kefir, that's fine?\n\n \r\nBut in this heat, two days is usually all it takes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nMine looks so chunky.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's too far, too far.\n\n Now, if you have it chunky like that, you can blend it, and it'll, emulsify again, it would be.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Eat Lettuce Last Meal Of Day \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, we should eat lettuce you said\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHead lettuce, iceberg lettuce?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat are we supposed to do with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the head lettuce, you can eat?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow much of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you put it in your juice, about 10% of your juice?\n\n \r\nIf you want to eat it, half a head of lettuce a day, but the last thing before you go to bed.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut one thing is they didn't come organic, I've only seen conventional.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, when you get it organic, eat it.\n\n Don't get it on inorganic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy the last meal of the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause the fibers will cause over alkalinity in the system?\n\n So, if any meat comes behind the lettuce, it won't digest properly.\n\n \r\nSo, I don't feel like people need to eat whole vegetables for that reason.\n\n So, if it's the last thing before you go to bed, you're not gonna eat for another five hours.\n\n  \r\nSo, the meat's not gonna catch up with it and it'll be acid again, unless you're eating too often.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou wouldn't have it with colostrum and then have lettuce.\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (18) Epsom Salts \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a question about the bath, what do Epsom salts do\n\n Are they absolutely awful in terms of these bags?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, not necessarily, you could also use Epsom salts?\n\n It's just minerals that will help pull out toxicity, salt helps break down oils quicker.\n\n That's why I say sea salt, two tablespoons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf somebody used more than you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSkin will be more dry?\n\n Skin will get redder.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about any other.\n\n The apple cider vinegar, the milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny other will create a little bit of an imbalance?\n\n I've been perfecting this for a long time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Farmed Fish \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou need some seafood\n\n It could be oysters.\n\n It can be anything that's wild ocean caught.\n\n  \r\nA lot of scallops are wild, but when the shellfish is farmed, it only means that they put a fence in the ocean, government lets them put a fence out there and nobody's allowed in that area.\n\n \r\nSo, they're not feeding the fish anything unusual, the sea creatures, the oysters, clams, scallops, they're still eating right from the ocean.\n\n So, those are not the bad farmed foods.\n\n  \r\nThe bad farmed fish are the ones where they dig a lake and they feed them alfalfa pellets and anything that is thrown away from some kind of processing.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nAnd worse yet, the ones up in the Vancouver area in Seattle now for salmon farming, if they're done in the wild estuaries and whatnot, they're contaminating the wild caught salmon out there.\n\n \r\nSo, they're actually man feeding salmon in the ocean.\n\n You know that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, they're not really allowed to do that, but what they're doing is they're letting them escape and they're breeding with the wild ones and that's causing the problem?\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nThey have allowed them to feed manmade fruit to the contained salmon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I think that they were proposing that, but the last time I read that, they weren't allowed to do it yet, but that the fish were escaping.\n\n They were jumping over and causing all kinds of problems, they were getting all kinds of diseases.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Fatigue, Sleep Cycle, Blood Thinners, Use Honey \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDoesn't have to be a pound of red meat\n\n It has to be a pound of meat all together.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI'm getting fatigued in and out the day, by 10:00PM, I'm dead.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll animals take naps during the day and they sleep at night CS.\n\n The man in the wild went to sleep at sunset, got up sometime during the night, ate and went back to sleep.\n\n \r\nThat's a normal cycle if you're wildly living outdoors.\n\n I lived outdoors for three years, so I know what it was like, and that's what it's like.\n\n \r\nMan normally has that cycle.\n\n So, you're just getting more normal.\n\n 10:00PM is still pretty late, but you probably wake up after the sun's risen because you're sleeping indoors.\n\n If you're sleeping outdoors, you'd be awake before the suns come u \r\nCoumadin is very toxic: damages liver, gall bladder, and spleen.\n\n It's not good at all.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat is it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCoumadin's a blood thinner?\n\n It drops the body's vitamin K and vitamin U, so it doesn't plot properly.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs it just a chemical.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it's a chemical?\n\n It's a medication.\n\n Just eat lots of honey to thin the blood.\n\n \r\nAnybody, anybody that has a congestive system, if you lie down, gravity pushes it right down.\n\n There's not much passage anyway, because gravity works against it.\n\n Can't sleep.\n\n I had the same thing after the poison mushrooms.\n\n Constricted everything in my body, so I had to sleep at an angle.\n\n Mainly sitting up.\n\n \r\nFor two and a half years, I had sleep anesthesia.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhy would honey work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause of the enzyme activity, but without robbing the body of vitamin U and vitamin K, which causes internal bleeding, causes, causes massive problems to the liver and spleen?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Fats Have To Be Under 96 Deg, Soft Nuts Alway Better \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, you just have to be careful, fats have to be under 96°\n\n\r\nAlso, use the soft nuts.\n\n The soft nuts are always better.\n\n Like the pecan, and the walnut, those are your best.\n\n If you have a thyroid problem then you don't want to have the pine nuts, even though they're soft because they deter the production of thyroxin, all four.\n\n\r\nI mean, somebody had the pine nuts in a dish here today, but it was such a small amount, it's okay.\n\n But if you're doing your nut formula pine nuts, it can be too much.\n\n If you're a hyperactive person, do pine nuts.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Fermented Foods \n \n**[2005],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a question regarding fermented foods that various tribes and cultures- there's been a lot of research on how tribes eat raw\n\n What's your take on fermented foods that the Hadza and the Eskimos presumably used along with their diets.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen we're talking about Sally Fallon and a lot of those people that have had no fricking experimental experience.\n\n\r\nNor did Price (Weston A.\n\n Price), Price went around observing never experimenting.\n\n So, all his conclusions are theoretical and based on no fact.\n\n He comes to conclusions based on observations, just like Kathy just did.\n\n It's based on nothing foundational.\n\n \r\nWhen I'd experimented with those fermented foods, and I started experimenting with them in the early 70s before Sally Fallon was breathing in this business, and they created all kinds of bacterial disorders.\n\n Vegetarian animal needs a vegetable fermentation, a human being does not need a vegetable fermentation.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Fermented Milk Too Long \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLets talk about fermentation though\n\n Does that mean kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat fermentation is for that food?\n\n It's not a vegetable fermentation.\n\n So, it helps pre-digest that food, but if you are letting it go high fermented like I did, that's too far, too much alcohol.\n\n**[bacteria]**\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, what's the longest you should let it ferment for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nProbably five days?\n\n \r\nBut if you put into the fridge, it's gonna stop it.\n\n It's gonna stay right where it is.\n\n \r\nWhen I make my kefir yogurt, what I do is I take two quarts of milk, and I pour about six ounces by volume of milk into a small jar, I put two ounces of honey, I blend that.\n\n Then I take a third milk bottle, so I've got three quarts and I divide everything evenly of the milk.\n\n Then I take the honey, blend it in the milk and I pour that in evenly to all three.\n\n Then I have two ounces of cream in each one, and then I shake it up and I put it in a dark warm cupboard for 1.\n\n5 - 2 days, and then I have kefir.\n\n Then I put it in the refrigerator, like a nice thick kefir.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIf the day is very warm, you wanna take it out sooner, don't you.\n\n Or you just leave it there too?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if it gets thicker sooner, that's fine?\n\n Take it out as soon as it starts to thicken.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLet's say we leave our milk in the cupboard for 2 weeks and then put that in the fridge.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that may be a little too much alcohol?\n\n Did you start having gas afterwards.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI don't think so?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, when they start to separate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nJust shake it up again?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Fermented Sugar Cane Juice \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLet me give you an example\n\n When I was in Vietnam and Cambodia last summer at this time, I was not able to get vegetable juice, like my celery and, and cucumber juice like I had in Thailand.\n\n And in the streets, you get juice right there in, you can in Mexico too, but in Cambodian and Vietnam, they were not available.\n\n \r\nSo, I ran into a vegetable that I thought, this could be dangerous, sugarcane.\n\n I said, \"Oh my God, sugar\".\n\n You know, I was such a sugarholic, I was a thief for it.\n\n I was a diabetic and I would get so starved for sugar I would steal boxes of chocolate covered cherries and go through them in 40 minutes.\n\n \r\nI used to steal 4 or 5 candy bars like Babe Ruth's or Hershey bars and eat those in about 40 minutes and it would kill me for the rest of the day, so I didn't have to worry about it, I just crashed.\n\n  \r\nBut if I didn't have that with the insulin that I was taking, I was just nuts, delirious.\n\n \r\nSo, I thought, this is my opportunity to detox, so let me try the sugarcane.\n\n So, I happened to be in Cambodia at the time, where they juice it on the street.\n\n It doesn't taste very good.\n\n So they put like a half of a lime per glass to give it a nicer flavor, so I took two ounces, waited an hour, nothing happened.\n\n \r\nSo, I took another four ounces, nothing.\n\n I took eight ounces, nothing happened, no sugar reaction at all, took 16 ounces, no sugar reaction.\n\n Then I realized that's why they boiled the sugar cane 450 to 700 degrees because the sugar is in the cellulose, not in the juice.\n\n  \r\nSo, the sugar cane juice is almost like celery, almost has no carbs in it.\n\n \r\nSo, I started drinking and I thought, hmm, since I was a sugarholic and I had spent 22 years of eating a tremendous amount of sugar.\n\n I mean, if I had bold cereal with sugar crisps, I put an extra four tablespoons of sugar on that and they were already sweet.\n\n That's what I would do.\n\n  \r\nI was almost like Hitler who put sugar on top of the icing of a cake and put sugar in his wine.\n\n He was a vegetarian on top of that.\n\n  \r\nSo, I decided I would ferment the sugar cage juice and detox.\n\n Because whenever you've eaten anything cooked, you've destroyed all the bacteria, all the fermentation bacteria, all the molding bacteria, anything that'll break that food substance down naturally when your body is finished with it to clear it out the body.\n\n \r\nIt's just like you have a piece of fruit and lets say you eat part of it, and then what does it do.\n\n It rots?\n\n It ferments, it turns into a mold and it disintegrates and becomes part of the earth again, then plants can eat it, so it's a recycling.\n\n Inside the body it's the same thing.\n\n That's how we use bacteria and fungus to regenerate and to discard waste.\n\n \r\nSo, I ate so much sugar that had no bacteria in it, no fungi, no mycelium that breeds the fungi that I thought I would detoxify myself by fermenting it.\n\n  \r\nSo, I fermented about 16 ounces and I took it half one day and half the next day.\n\n I had hives this size all over my body.\n\n My backside, all around here, all over my chest and legs and my butt and my rectum.\n\n \r\nAnd they turned into scabs.\n\n I refused to scratch, even though it itched terribly.\n\n So, I spent two days in Hanoi in my hotel room, just dealing with these hives and itching.\n\n I had tomatoes and cucumber that I was rubbing on them to help cool them down.\n\n Tomatoes and cucumbers were the only thing that would stop it.\n\n \r\nBut I had scabs coming off of it that lasted for six weeks, but one thing that it did was it helped trim a lot of sugar products that had been still stored in my body.\n\n Funny, after I did that, I did not have to have the high weight that I normally had because I usually stayed his size and it helped bring me down.\n\n \r\nThen I decided to do the same thing with raw milk, and when I had fermented the raw milk, I let it go 10 days, really fermented and I drank almost a whole quart in one day.\n\n Mistake.\n\n I had diarrhea for two months from it and my bone just started disappearing and all of my weight went way down.\n\n  \r\nBut what it did was it cleaned all that stuff out, so now I don't have to have all that weight to feel comfortable and fine.\n\n Went 28 years on the diet before I went into that kind of detox.\n\n  \r\nSo, when I do the detoxification book, it'll come around next spring sometime and be out and available.\n\n I will suggest these things if you're healthy enough to do detoxification, but never push them because you will not be able to live with it easily.\n\n \r\nYou will not be able to go to work.\n\n You won't be able to function, so don't push anything that I suggest and make sure you've been on the diet for two and a half years before you do anything.\n\n Before you push any detoxification or you're asking for trouble.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAll your pictures will be in the detox book.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* let me tell you, I'm collecting them?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow fermented was the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n10 days?\n\n It was so fermented that when I took the lid off, the alcohol burned my nose.\n\n Turned my eyes red.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat did you put the milk in.\n\n In a cupboard for 10 days?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn a cupboard outside the refrigerator?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Fermented Vege Juice \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nJuice could sour in the fridge is that that's no good\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's detoxification if you want to?\n\n If you've been on the diet long enough, you can let your couple cups of juice ferment for 5, 7 days, and then turn it into a vinegar for detoxification, which you don't want to do too much of.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nWhen I drank fermented vegetable juice and it was only about what, a couple days too old, I still got diarrhea.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYep.\n\n It'll clean you out.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow many are you supposed to drink.\n\n How much of the juice are you supposed to drink a day?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I'm not supposed to drink any, but if you do, no more than a cup a day, no more than two cups a week?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Fermented Vegetables \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAre we talking about all the other things like sauerkraut and all that stuff\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll of them will interfere with the natural bacteria that you have for meat and dairy?\n\n That's for a vegetarian animal.\n\n You won't find any vegetarian animals that will eat fermented anything cause they're not used to eating cooked foods.\n\n They don't need that added bacteria.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo the fermentation is for detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's for detoxification, yes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, is it a good thing for us on the primal diet once in a while.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you've eaten cooked vegetables in your lifetime?\n\n Absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBut you wouldn't eat it every day.\n\n Something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely not?\n\n You'll destroy your digestibility.\n\n After I did that sugar cane, I had diarrhea for two months.\n\n I had gas.\n\n I never had gas or rarely had gas, it never stunk once I started eating meat and dairy.\n\n \r\nAfter that fermented sugar cane juice, I still had nasty gas from eggs.\n\n I destroyed some of the bacteria that digests my egg properly.\n\n \r\nSo, I'm rotting eggs or I'm letting eggs get high, eat them to help supplement that again.\n\n I don't know how long it's gonna take.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nReason I'm asking is because I was on the diet for about 5 or 6 or 7 years, and then I decided to have some sauerkraut one day, and just like you I never had gas, but like within 24 hours, I was like, \"Woooo\".\n\n No way, not me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt just goes in there and destroys the acidic bacteria that feeds and breaks down meats and dairy.\n\n It destroys it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Go To Doctor For Broken Bone Only \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWith trichinosis, they had no inflammatory bowel disease and they were back five months later asking for more trichinosis\n\n You have to understand that the pharmaceutical industry runs the medical profession.\n\n They want you to take medication.\n\n The doctors are ignorant parrots, and that's all they are.\n\n\r\nThey're stupid parrots.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThey must know something don't they.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, there are some bright ones?\n\n I've had 50 MDs on this diet.\n\n\r\nI didn't do it, they came to me, but there are 50 MDs on this diet that I know of.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nGeneral practitioners.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere were all kinds, all kinds of MDs?\n\n Specialists of all sorts and general practitioners.\n\n\r\nThere's no reason to go to a doctor, unless you've broken a bone.\n\n You want to have it reset, you lost your nose or some harm to your body, put it back together.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Headaches From Meat = Veg Juice \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhen I'm eating meat, I'm noticing that I'm getting a headache\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour blood's getting very acid and you need to eat more green juice.\n\n How much do you drink in a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, we were doing it almost five days a week, but recently?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou need more celery, gotta be least 80%, and if you're doing any kind of a strong herb, then no more than 5% total of your juice.\n\n Otherwise, you're gonna force uncomfortable detoxification.\n\n So, in a situation where you got a headache whenever you eat the meat, then you need to alkanalize the blood more, and eat like 80% celery, 10% cucumber or 10% head lettuce and doing, like 5% to 10% parsley.\n\n You can even use 5% zucchini.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Hepatitis, Viruses,bacteria Break Down % \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHave a party\n\n Celebrate your, celebrate your C.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDid they give you a test recently.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI haven't had a test in a year, but last year it keeps getting lower and lower?\n\n I've been on the diet for four years now and it keeps getting lower and lower about my liver count, every time I get the test.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mean the C is getting lower.\n\n \r\nNot your protein of your liver?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIt's an elevated count.\n\n  \r\nIt's getting low.\n\n It's not that low, it's getting low.\n\n And it's funny, my cholesterol doesn't seem to go low.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDon't want it to.\n\n \r\nFirst of all, if you get any of the hepatitis, all the way from A to H, they are all cleansers.\n\n They are virus.\n\n \r\nVirus are not alive.\n\n Virus are not contagious, your body when it's so toxic that it can't incubate and facilitate bacteria or parasites or fungi to help detoxify certain areas of body.\n\n If its the liver, it's hepatitis, the body manufactures a virus.\n\n A lot of them are hepatitis virus.\n\n The cells manufacture it, it's to cleanse, it's to disassemble.\n\n \r\nIf the body's healthy enough, it can use bacteria, fungus, or parasites to go eat up the dead tissue.\n\n But if it's too toxic or say you have chemotherapy oryou've had a lot of, asthmatic medication, allergy medication, your liver is very poisoned.\n\n There's no way that you're gonna be able to facilitate and have an environment that's clean enough for bacteria, fungus, or parasites.\n\n \r\nSo, your body has to make a solvent to go in and chemically disassemble it.\n\n Now the difference between bacteria and parasites and fungus helping you detoxify is that they could eat anywhere from 50 to 100 times, their weight in a 24-hour period, and they defecate a small portion of that.\n\n Parasites will make a discarding feces or excretion/secretion of only 1% to 1.\n\n5% of what they consume.\n\n \r\nThat means they can take a mass as big as this room according to their size and reduce it into about a basketball size.\n\n That's very little toxicity for us to have to deal with.\n\n Bacteria is a little different, they can eat about 50 times their weight and reduces it down to about 5%, so we've got a big beach ball, but still, it's better than this whole room worth of toxicity.\n\n \r\nFungus is the same thing, it reduces.\n\n However, when a fungus is involved, there is about 20% waste thrown off.\n\n That's why you get dryness of the skin, you have itching whenever there's a fungus.\n\n Remember all yeasts are fungus's, so the women deal with yeast infections, you have a 20% discarding, which causes all the itching and odor.\n\n \r\nWhen you have a virus, it is not alive.\n\n It does not eat and consume.\n\n It just goes in there and just breaks it and dissolves it just like you would take muriatic acid and you want to clean the garbage from your pool.\n\n It doesn't consume it and reduce the toxicity; it contaminates all the water that it's in.\n\n \r\nSo, it spreads it all throughout your entire system, so you have a bucket of contaminated fluid.\n\n It's the same thing when the body uses virus, the contamination is spread throughout the body.\n\n \r\nUnderstand that.\n\n So, your hepatitis is a virus?\n\n People get very sick from that virus because of all the contamination it's sending out to the body, but it's still the best thing your liver can do is to have the virus to get the liver well.\n\n Otherwise, you go into lethargy, chronic fatigue be unable to be functional.\n\n \r\nSo, the hepatitis is what you need, but you can tell your liver's getting better because you need less of the hepatitis to break down the liver cells.\n\n You have less liver contamination spread in your body.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nI have prostate cancer.\n\n What can I do for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it's mainly cause of vegetable oil?\n\n Vegetable oils hardened in the prostate gland, it dries out and it doesn't stretch.\n\n It just keeps swelling.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) High Sugar \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, I put it in the recipe book\n\n I say take butter with you, take the honey with you, take the cheese with you.\n\n You get meat and eggs anywhere.\n\n Those are your primary focus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nVegetable Juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou just have to eat as green fruit, as green as you can get it?\n\n Unripe so it doesn't have a lot of sugar in it, it's a way to do it.\n\n I go to these fruit stands and they're cutting up all this really ripe fruit.\n\n  \r\nIn Asia, the elderly only eats green fruit, they don't even like ripe fruit, but this new generation got all these sugar and soda pops, they go for the sugary stuff.\n\n So, when I go up to one of these carts, I say, give me the parts you're gonna throw away, give me the rind of the watermelon.\n\n \r\nI'll sit there and eat a few watermelon rinds, perfect.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou eat the green inside.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't eat the green outside, the very hard stuff?\n\n I eat the light green and the white of the rind.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAll I ever hear is you gotta eat raw organic, ripe fruit, but it's too much sugar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nToo much sugar deteriorates the bones?\n\n That's why all those people on fruitarian diets lose their teeth and lose their bones.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYeah, she knows.\n\n She did the same thing I did.\n\n She's been a fruitarian for a liitle while, too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI can see.\n\n \r\nYou have very thin bones, and your skin is also not real strong.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI was just asking about that cause I saw got your list here, but I've never ever in my life been able to eat raw honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUnheated.\n\n Completely unheated?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI don't think so?\n\n I have candida.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat causes them to detoxify and eliminate their poisons.\n\n \r\nIt doesn't feed them unless it's heated honey.\n\n So, if you have one of the brands that he sells, you won't have a problem.\n\n You may have a temporary itching.\n\n You just have a little bit more butter or cream with it, and you just might just want to stick with the comb, the honey in the comb.\n\n \r\nThat's little bit more pure.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, have a smoothie and put butter and cream in it with honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you do that, it's gonna disperse it quicker, to disperse sugars, the honey by itself, or with cream or butter only?\n\n Spoon and eat it.\n\n That's the best way to do it.\n\n If you put it in a vehicle to send the milk sugars out into the body cause they'll go just rapidly with the honey in it cause of all the enzyme activity, then you're gonna have a lot of milk sugars irritating your body.\n\n \r\nYou're gonna have more itching.\n\n It doesn't increase fungus at all, you're just dealing with more sugar detox, it dries out the skin.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Honey Moisturizer \n \n \n \n \n### (32) Hot Water Bottle On Balls, Sperm Dies Above 97 Deg \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHot baths, hot water bottle between your legs at night\n\n It's also a good anti pregnancy therapy there because the body keeps in the male- this very low temperature, about 96 degrees.\n\n If it goes above that the sperm die like that.\n\n So, if you put a hot water bottle between your legs and then cook your.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) How Book Got Published \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMany variables, but I think that you should\n\n My publisher, he says, if you didn't look this healthy, I'd never published your books.\n\n The main reason he did was, he found a copy of my manuscript and sent it to his brother who had had a sleeping disorder since he was 6 years old, and he was 23 at the time, my publisher was 25 at the time he gave my manuscript to his brother and said, \"Try this diet and see.\n\n Lots of people do well\", and this is before he published the book, just some kid who was just an entrepreneur, produced his first film at 25 years old and, you know, scabs of money.\n\n This kid was brilliant.\n\n \r\nNever went to college, brilliant kid.\n\n So, he's sent his brother, his brother did the diet, five days later, they broke the door down to his room cause they thought he committed suicide cause they didn't hear him for five hours.\n\n Asleep.\n\n First time he'd slept more than 20 minutes since he was 6 years old, he never went into REM.\n\n \r\nHe never got a deep sleep, so was antisocial, homicidal, suicidal, everything, and the father had spent well over six figures in doctor bills, psychologist, psychiatrist, every medication, nothing worked, this diet did it.\n\n The father went to his desk, wrote a check for $75,000 and sent to his son, and said published this book.\n\n \r\nThat's how the book got published.\n\n \r\nBut he still didn't believe the bacteria, so he wouldn't let me say the bacteria was good.\n\n Now he lets me do anything.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nAajonus, I don't think anybody who's been on the diet for more than 3, 4 or 5 years and doubts at this point, like myself, how good this really is.\n\n \r\nI really don't.\n\n I think all of us find it really great.\n\n We're not here to argue with other people about it, especially Sally Fallon or anybody else.\n\n I get people who come over and call me, and they want to get into an argument about it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCan't, there's no arguing.\n\n \r\nYou have to experience it.\n\n You either experience it or you don't.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) How To Start \n \n \n \n \n### (35) Iodine, Barium, How To Get Rid Of \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about the use of radiated iodine for testing the thyroid\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the worst you can do because iodine, the radioactive material lives for 58,000 years?\n\n You gonna outlive it.\n\n\r\nNo way?\n\n You've gotta get it out of the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how do you do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUh, raspberries and coconut cream will get radioactive iodine?\n\n To get barium out of the body, it has to be dark berries and coconut cream.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Ionizers \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, what about the ions\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe ions?\n\n When I did tests with those all through the seventies, they were all bad?\n\n Because what happens if you're in the room, you have to understand the ions are bombarded.\n\n And what happens, they split molecules, and these are toxins that are split into finer particles.\n\n\r\nThey can be absorbed intracellular.\n\n So, when these are bombarding, they're going into your respiratory system, into your skin, everywhere.\n\n You're gonna have one of those on, you have in on when you're not in the room.\n\n During the day you put in the bedroom, and at night you put in the living room, the other room while you're in the bedroom, close the door.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Menoipause \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI would like to know about menopause\n\n In the last month, I've been doing this for 6 months and in the last month I've noticed anxiety close to my menstrual cycle.\n\n Random hot flashes, very mild.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I only have one client right here that didn't make it through menopause easily.\n\n \r\nI probably had about 300 women that have gone through menopause on the diet, most of them usually got through it in three months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut, I'm noticing an increase in like adrenaline surges, which is manifesting sequences of anxiety.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just need more green juice.\n\n\r\nYou gotta get the blood alkaline and not get the intestines too alkaline.\n\n That's a fine line.\n\n\r\nThat means you're going to have some discomfort, but when you're having the hot flashes it's best to use cucumber and celery in your juice.\n\n Let's say, 10% cucumber, always a peeled cucumber, even if it's organic when it's for hot flashes and you are trying to cool the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI use a lot of parsley.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMay be too much parsley, can heat up the body.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nIt will also irritate the nervous system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you take too much.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe filter on the green juice, you want to get as much fiber as possible.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAs long as it's from the juice, you're not going to be having problems?\n\n \r\nIt's good to have a little bit of that fiber in there.\n\n If you've been on the diet as long as I have, it's not good to do that, but if you've got impactations in your intestines, if you look in your eyes and around the pupil, they're brown, the browner the worse, then you can use the more of that fiber from the juice.\n\n\r\nAnd if it's clear, then the less, so you wanna filter it out.\n\n But otherwise in, I see you.\n\n So, that's okay.\n\n It's a small amount.\n\n\r\nThe parsley I would say reduce the parsley.\n\n \r\n80% celery \r\n5% parsley\r\n10% cucumber.\n\n \r\n5% zucchini (For zinc)\r\n\r\nThat should help a lot.\n\n Like I said in the first book, when a woman goes through menopause, it isn't a cessation of hormones, it's a whole changeover in the types of hormones that are produced.\n\n When you start making that change, the body starts detoxing old, toxic hormones from your body.\n\n It can be adrenaline.\n\n It can be anything that's attached to those particular hormones, like higher estrogen levels and they go with it and that can create anxiety and can create irritability, just regular old PMS stuff that accompanies the hot flashes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Milkshakes Cant Digest \n \n**[2005],[Carol]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe milkshakes that I'm taking twice a day, after six months now I'm finding the one at night, I can't digest it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo much.\n\n Don't have it?\n\n Just down 3 or 4 eggs.\n\n**[Carol]**\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n That all the stuff that seems like I can't digest it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you probably have had reached a level where it's just too much dairy for you with everything else you're eating?\n\n Now the Fulani tribe, they live 90% on raw dairy.\n\n that's almost all they eat.\n\n They'll maybe eat a cooked meat meal or a raw meat meal about once every three weeks.\n\n What did they do.\n\n\r\nThe more cows they have, the richer they are, the greater their wealth?\n\n\r\nBut they don't have any problems, they never get sick of milk because that's their diet, but on this diet you're eating meats and all the other substances.\n\n You don't need that same, inundation of dairy, but it's very helpful at first to do that.\n\n  \r\nBut if you start sucking down eggs at night, maybe chase it with a little honey and butter.\n\n You'll find yourself much more hungry.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) More You Get More You Want \n \n \n \n \n### (40) Mucousless Diet \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout milk and dairy products, it's causing blend phlegm\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's good.\n\n How do you think you expel the poisons through the membrane without phlegm.\n\n \r\nCause the doctors want you to take medication, pharmaceutical house wants you to take medication?\n\n And a few guys like Arnold Ehret believed that mucus wasn't good.\n\n It was his thing, but he died a miserable, dry, nasty death.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nFirst book I ever read when I was 19 years old was Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System, and that's what convinced me to become a fruitarian.\n\n \r\nThe first book I read at age 19, according to health was Arnold Ehret's Mucusless Diet Healing System, which convinced me to become a fruitarian.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLots of damage.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought he died by hitting his head on the ground.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe was blacking out?\n\n He was having all kinds of disorders, was sugar disorders.\n\n He was so skinny, he was thinner than you sweetheart, and he was dry, so dry skinned.\n\n He would sugar out, he would just freak out.\n\n He was not a nice healthy man \r\nEver try having sex without mucus.\n\n Is that any fun?\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nNot recently?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCan you imagine blowing your nose or breathing without mucus protecting you, you'd be dry and blistered.\n\n Mucus is so important.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Muscale Fatigue, Fruitarian Vs Cooked Meat Eater \n \n**[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a question about muscle fatigue,\r\n\n\r\nMuscle fatigue, it depends on why it is\n\n You can have uric acids that stored in your system.\n\n Unlikely, unless you're a cooked meat eater.\n\n If you're a fruitarian, it's a mineral imbalance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust a lot of exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a lot of uric acid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat would help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of mineral concentration?\n\n Usually cream and milk help in combination with pineapple or green banana with milk and honey.\n\n Always put honey in something like that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Never Use Skin Brush \n \n \n \n \n### (43) No Red Meat Only High Hormones \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs it possible to do this diet without eating red meat at all\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThis diet wouldn't exist without raw meat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRed meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are some people that can eat the diet without red meat.\n\n I wouldn't say that they do as well, but they can function fine.\n\n If they have a high adrenaline count, if it's men a high testosterone and a high thyroid.\n\n\r\nI've only known one woman who could do it, and she did it for 37 years, but then her spine started deteriorating.\n\n So, she started eating red meat, and she had high estrogen, high adrenaline and high thyroid.\n\n So, those were the only people who were able do it.\n\n If you match that, I would say, yeah, you could do it.\n\n Well, I don't know how long, but probably able to do it until.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Nut Formula Or Air Popper Pop Conr \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's important if you have those kinds of hormones detoxifying, if you find yourself hyperactive and nervous, like adrenaline rushes or estrogen rushes, go for the nut formula\n\n Make sure do the net formula about every three days.\n\n And the last thing in the evening or with the last meat meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes that just slow it down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat the nut formula does is it absorbs the hormones?\n\n If the net formula doesn't work for you, then you have to go there to bread, or the air popped popcorn with lots of butter, something like that.\n\n Cooked starch.\n\n Most people can do it with the net formula, but some people can't.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Oliev Oil Isn't Vege Oil \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOlive oil\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, olive is not a vegetable?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Only Raw Cashews \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMy cravings is for cashews, for nuts\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDon't eat cashews, unless you can get them totally raw.\n\n I know that there's a company that claims that we get completely raw cashew.\n\n If they sit on your stomach, they're not really raw cause I found others that he's claiming were raw, and then when I went to the producer, I found out that they weren't raw, not my raw.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Opiates In Iceberg Lettuce \n \n \n \n \n### (48) Osteoporosis, Get Ultrasound \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRemember I had cancer of the bone\n\n They wanted to replace this femur joint because the bone was 50% dissolved.\n\n This shoulder, 30% dissolved.\n\n No pain.\n\n No pain! \r\nThe joints completely restored, all of those restored.\n\n It took me a long time.\n\n It took me 15 years, but I did it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you have to have a radiation test to see if it was restored, that's what they do with us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can have ultrasound, they do it in the swimming pool, UCLA has it.\n\n So, you have to do to a doctor who's not gonna x-ray.\n\n It can be done with an ultrasound in the swimming pool.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Ozone Oxidizes Fat \n \n \n \n \n### (50) Perrir & San Pell Low On Carbon \n \n \n \n \n### (51) Polluted LA Water \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, if you're using city water, municipal water in the valley, you only have 158 chemicals in the water, and almost all of it is from industrial pollution\n\n The only thing the city prevents you from getting is bacteria, the things we want.\n\n They don't clean anything else.\n\n The water is filthy with chemicals.\n\n\r\nYou get to use it before LA gets it.\n\n So, LA gets to use it after you if you're in the valley.\n\n\r\nIn LA now there's 193 chemicals in the water.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Radiation Stops Cellular Regeneration \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAn x-ray stops reproduction of cells for a minimum of six months\n\n That means no cellular division and no healing in that area.\n\n So, if that part of the body has to heal, it has to rob live cells from somewhere else in the body, which is in the nutrient.\n\n \r\nIn its pure term, doctors use endometriosis, only ovarian cells are used somewhere else in the body, but endometriosis is when any part of the body uses a cell from another area of the body, and that happens all the time.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Raw Cacao \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat's your position on raw cacao\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I did experiments with it, it causes adrenaline rushes, it causes dryness?\n\n The theobromine is still very active, so it irritates the nervous system.\n\n It has caffeine, and theobromine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven in a raw form it's still not good for you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVegetables are raw and they're not good for you?\n\n \r\nThose beans are not good for you.\n\n \r\nAny kind of bean it takes an herbivore or to digest them properly.\n\n\r\nFor us they're not good, they're not healthy.\n\n Just like vegetable oils, they'll cause hardening of the arteries and the hardening of the system.\n\n So, if you're young enough, you can eat them and make you feel good, but in the long run, it's not good for you.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nMexicans been eating beans for centuries, and they're doing well.\n\n \r\nThey look well, they're strong.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey haven't been doing it for centuries, but they've been doing you for about a century.\n\n\r\nI wouldn't say they're doing too well.\n\n They're pretty irritable, and pretty passionate.\n\n\r\nIt's like the Italians with the olive oil.\n\n It's so irritating to their systems that they're always in some kind of a passion, conflict.\n\n\r\nSo, you have to see what these foods do behaviorally.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Read Book Once A Year \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI tell people to do it, read the book once a year, each book, once a year, go to one of my lectures at one of these places once a year\n\n Hear it because there's just so much in the books and the lectures.\n\n There's no way you can absorb it in 15 years.\n\n Keep doing it, remind yourself.\n\n\r\nAnd he did it.\n\n The next morning when I was there, he was a bright as rabbit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Recessed Gums, How To Clean Teeth \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nRecess gums is a long process\n\n He's asking what can we do to recessed gums.\n\n I realized that almost 80% of the metals that you have, the free radicals, the heavy metals that you have in the body are in the brain cause that's where most of the electromagnetic signals are transmitted and it takes metallic minerals to do that?\n\n \r\nSo, every time you eat a cooked food, the free radicals, the heavy metals that had been chelated with some kind of a nutrient, whether it was arsenic, lead, mercury n very small amounts, it was all in the proper combination, it was a nutrient.\n\n Once it was cooked, it then became a free radical poison.\n\n \r\n80% of it goes to the brain.\n\n When it detoxes, it detoxes out the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands.\n\n Almost two thirds of it goes that process out.\n\n That's why you should always have a coated tongue, unless you've been on the diet maybe 30 years.\n\n  \r\nAnd you will always have plaque on your teeth as long as you brain is detoxing and the way to remove that plaque, I just told you.\n\n \r\nSo, heavy metals as they come down and come out the gums, it will cause a receding of gums.\n\n Nothing you can do about it, except eat some cheese and try to get more of the heavy metals to go through the digestive tract, instead of out your gums.\n\n But if you're using the coconut cream, it will help dissolve it and keep it from staying in the gums and irritating the gums and irritating your dentine.\n\n \r\nNow it's not the bacteria that's a problem with decay, the heavy metals get onto the teeth.\n\n They pull out the enamel damage.\n\n Then the bacteria results, trying to get rid of the damaged dentine.\n\n So, the first process is the poison metals that are coming from the brain, use the coconut cream and clay, or just the coconut cream and get it out of your mouth.\n\n \r\nIf you've got receding gums, get a water pick, lemon juice, the sparkling water, especially gerolsteiner, and coconut cream and shoot that in your gums.\n\n You do that every day for 10 days, you will clean that plaque, so you don't have to have it scraped and it will keep your gums from deteriorating.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nIt's all mixed together.\n\n The gerolsteiner, the coconut cream, and the clay?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's all mixed together in the water?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow much do you use of the clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, when you're brushing your teeth with the clay, that you don't use in a water pick?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nGreen clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n Use the Terramin clay now.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOh, it's better.\n\n Throw out the green clay?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you can use that for out of body stuff, but not in the mouth?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOut of body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSurface?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Red Meat For Glaucoma, Carrot Juice + Coco Cream \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYes, red meat is the most important I've found to reverse glaucoma  \r\nGlaucoma is when the body is not circulating in and out of the eye\n\n Circulation out of the eye is not as good as circulation into the eye.\n\n So, it creates a high pressure and it starts stretching the eyeball.\n\n \r\nIt causes scar tissue, it causes lesions in the whole membrane in and around the eye and the greater the lesions, the less the visibility will be and then you could start developing cataracts.\n\n So, for some reason, red meat, and you would think it was white and you think would be seafood.\n\n \r\nBut it isn't.\n\n In my experiments, I found that when I used exclusively white meat to help reverse an eye condition, it did not work.\n\n So, when I use a high proportion, like 80% red meat and 20% white meat, it worked best.\n\n And when I found that I used 10%, fowl, 10% seafood and 80% red meat, it worked the best.\n\n \r\nAlso, two cups of carrot juice a week, one cup at a time with three ounces of coconut cream.\n\n For some reason, it gets in and starts cleaning out the eyeball that's causing restriction of blood out of the eye.\n\n It usually takes about six months.\n\n  \r\nOne experiment I did with a dog because he was completely blind with cataracts and the dog first had glaucoma.\n\n \r\nThe dog had many other problems.\n\n He was completely crippled; he was 14.\n\n5 years old.\n\n He had MS to the point where this is all he could move *imitation*.\n\n So, his master would take him outside, have to rub his back in just for him to be able to go: urinate or defecate.\n\n So, I put the dog on a raw diet and in six months, the dog was jumping up and down off the couch, going out the doggy door on his own \r\nHis vision was improved by 50% and that was a completely blind, deaf and crippled dog.\n\n And the dog could even hear.\n\n To what quality, I don't know, but you could say something to him, and he'd respond.\n\n \r\nThat's usually from vaccines.\n\n The aluminum or the mercury are both going into the lung.\n\n It's usually not repairable.\n\n  \r\nOn dogs it's not easy cause you can't get them eat a little cilantro and other foods.\n\n If the dog will eat some coconut cream, might be able to reverse it.\n\n If he takes to eating coconut, probably be able to reverse it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Sally Fallon Followers Unhealthy \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd if you look at the people who are long term on Sally Fallons suggestions\n\n They're bloated, they're anemic looking, they are not healthy people.\n\n  \r\nSally Fallon is not a healthy-looking person.\n\n She points to me as not being healthy either, but she's pointing to me after 2 accidents.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Sally Fallon Gets Older and Bloated \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom young guys\n\n Sally Fallon doesn't have that advantage.\n\n She just gets older and older and more and more bloated every year.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nWell, I think it's a mistake for anybody in this business at all to attack each other for not looking the picture of health.\n\n All of us are trying to aspire and I think it's a big mistake.\n\n I try not to attack anybody cause of, you know, well.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus goes on to

smell good\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoes that mean your nose works better or you have a good fragrance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNose works better.\n\n\r\nMy hearing and my sense of smell have improved and my vision is slightly down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you need to eat more red meat with fish.\n\n\r\nIt's the only thing I found to affect vision.\n\n \r\nIn appendix X of the first book I had the epoxy that came out of my nose and it caused me cancer to deteriorate almost half of my nose, put a hole in my bone here, huge hole here in the head and went down in and scarred my eye.\n\n The cornea, eight layers of scar tissue.\n\n\r\nThe ophthalmologist said that I would have to have a transplant, that's the only way that it would ever improve.\n\n So, I went have my driver's license renewed in April, and I was able to read the chart, and I said, okay, I don't need my glasses anymore.\n\n They said, \"Oh, no, once you had to wear glasses, you have to go to optometrist and he has to tell us that you don't have glaucoma.\n\n This is just a good day for you\".\n\n \r\nSo, I went back to the optometrist and she took a look and she said, \"You only have one layer of scar tissue left.\n\n So, you don't have to wear glasses anymore\".\n\n So, I didn't have to wear them.\n\n\r\nSo, you know, it's working, it's slow.\n\n It's been eight years since that, but it's working.\n\n They improved.\n\n So, about three months after that cancer burn in the eye my vision was 140 over 80.\n\n And now it's 20-40.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat foods did you say.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRed meat and fish?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou mean it was 20 - 200, and now it's 20-40.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, 20 - 40.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\n140 over 80 is blood pressure.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't remember what it was.\n\n 140 something.\n\n 20 - 140.\n\n No, the was the visual was bad on both sides?\n\n Cause 20 and 20 means you have good long sight and good close.\n\n**[James]**\n\r\nSo, you were nearsighted and far sighted.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It damaged both.\n\n I couldn't read or see distance with this eye, it was one blur.\n\n Now I can almost see detail.\n\n Like I can tell your eye there, I can see the outline of your glasses, just slightly blurred now, but I can read your t-shirt.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Shower After Bath \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAt the end of the bath, do you shower to clean up\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you don't wanna do it?\n\n You wanna let that coconut cream and everything sit on there because while you're in there, the food that you put in the water helps keep extracting all the poisons off.\n\n So, they're off the skin.\n\n That's the whole point.\n\n \r\nYou don't want to shower after that cause then you're going to take off the coconut cream and your skin's going to dry.\n\n  \r\nPlus, you're gonna get more chemicals on your skin from the water.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Stevia, Maple Syrup, Molasses Are Vege Oil \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat are the health benefits of stevia, if there are any\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nStevia?\n\n It's a sweetener?\n\n It's another toxic pollutive, chemical?\n\n Anytime you take any food and you isolate it, you have to use heat and, or a chemical solvent to extract it.\n\n  \r\nWould you take your food and soak it in kerosene before you eat it.\n\n \r\nThat's what it's like?\n\n Any food that's extracted no longer has any enzymes or couplings left.\n\n And unless you have that coupling, it's like me taking you, dismembering you and giving you a whole job, it's not gonna happen.\n\n**[James]**\n \r\nWhat most people don't understand about stevia and these other things, an easy way to explain it is.\n\n \r\nAnybody understand what maple syrup is.\n\n Okay, it's the same thing?\n\n You're taking the SAP of the tree, but you can't eat the sap off of the maple tree, it's unbelievably bad.\n\n But they boil it, cook it, and isolate it and create the sweet thing that we now eat.\n\n  \r\nIt's the same with stevia and a whole bunch of other things that they're using nowadays.\n\n What it is is a processed particle.\n\n It’s not nature provided at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's the same thing as molasses.\n\n The molasses is the garbage oil that's left from boiling sugarcane at at least 475°.\n\n They do it now at 725° or something like that.\n\n And that's the gunk garbage that's left on the bottom and that garbage because it is a vegetable oil causes hardening of the arteries and hardening of the heart.\n\n Vegetable oils cause all the hardening of the heart and hardening of the artery.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Sulfur In Well Water, Dont Drink Mineral RIch

used to go to Glen Ivy, I'd go every six weeks maybe.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou can't drink it every day.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou don't want to drink any water that high in concentrated minerals,  \r\n\n \r\nFour ounces I thought, half a cup?\n\n You said you could have that every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEvery day for how many days.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSeven days a week I've been drinking it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I don't suggest that \r\nYou start collecting minerals in your body, but you've got enough weight, so it's okay.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI can do it every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, you can probably do it every day?\n\n I think you would be fine.\n\n if you were skinny as she was it'd be a real problem cause it would demineralize you, but you eat enough fat.\n\n You're fine.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Sungazing \n \n \n \n \n### (65) Terramin Clay, Where To Buy \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you put green clay in

www.\n\nterramin.\n\ncom.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhy is the green clay not being considered good for your teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's okay for the teeth, it just doesn't whiten it like the Terramin does?\n\n\r\nFor the water tank, it's the gerolsteiner water.\n\n Say using 1.\n\n5 - 2 cups of the gerolsteiner water, you have a tablespoon of lemon juice, you can use a table spoon of vinegar also helps and table spoon of the coconut cream, and shoot it in your teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI was concerned C02 in the sparkling water.\n\n Is that a problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not that type?\n\n It's not a manufacturer one, it's in the well, okay.\n\n You came late, I talked about it earlier.\n\n In those wells, they've got a water table and they've got a carbon table now and they shoot them into the bottle at the same time.\n\n\r\nIf you're having CO2 manufactured in a laboratory, like the Coca Cola and Pepsi and all the diet sodas, that is toxic and can even cause headaches.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nAre you saying we should no longer use regular cream to brush our teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can?\n\n I'm just giving you the most up to date best.\n\n You can brush your teeth with any fat or any clay and fat, but I found that coconut cream dissolves everything better.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou won't use the primal facial to brush your teeth with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can do that too?\n\n I say you can use any fat formula to brush your teeth.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSome people don't know about what kind of water pick to pick up in the

        "content": "### (1) Chelation \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOkay, DMPS, DPS all of them are chelation's\n\n They're actual mineral toxicity, they're chemicals solvents that are used to magnetically pull-out heavy metals out of the glands and organs and veins, arteries, so that people can function better.\n\n But what it does is it does, in most of the people I've seen about 90 to 95% of the people I've seen that hda have chelation therapy or liquid minerals or colloidal silver high, mineral supplements to do such a thing.\n\n \r\nTheir skin, their connective tissue, their lymph, and their bones and cartilage are all metal contaminated because they don't give a fat substance that is natural that once those chelation's went down with those heavy metals, there's no way to get them out of the body.\n\n They've gotten them out of the glands, the veins and the arteries, but they have not got them out of the body.\n\n \r\nSo, they store in the lymph, connective tissues, skin, bone and cartilage.\n\n Contaminates everybody that I've ever seen that's had chelation therapy, liquid minerals, colloidal silver.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Chemo \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nReduce his chances of reversing cancer completely\n\n Before I came here, I went to the memorial for one of the executives in Scientology who's on the diet.\n\n She came to me after chemo, and i think she'd had surgery too.\n\n Wonderful high-powered women.\n\n I mean, you know, talked about mind over matter, if anybody had mind over matter, this woman could do it.\n\n Cancer still got her.\n\n I was at the Memorial, she didn't deteriorate like other people had and she had a great almost three years living with the diet and when she started on the diet, she was exhausted.\n\n Couldn't do anything.\n\n She didn't feel well after the chemo and the surgeries and didn't want to really live.\n\n \r\nAnd then she got on the diet and her whole life turned around since, so was doing great.\n\n \r\nWell, you know, the surgery, when the cancer came back, I asked her to do the fecal matter, but she wouldn't do it.\n\n I plead with her to do the fecal matter.\n\n \r\nIf you put anything in the liver, it keeps damaging the liver tissue.\n\n That means you digest less and less fat and fat, that's what you majorly need with cancer because that's what dissolves dead cells.\n\n But that doesn't mean you won't make it.\n\n I got other people make it beyond five years that have had that kind of therapy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about the cow shit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that would help him turn the cancer around definitely, it could permanently?\n\n  \r\nIf you can get it down to where it's not creating the hysteria that makes them go to get more chemo and then he can repair it from there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHe stopped the chemo after about two months.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n2 months is a lot of chemo, especially what they call it the liver bomb and they put it in there and they literally used to call it a liver bomb because it would just secrete the chemo like every 4 to 12 hours, it would secrete so much.\n\n And he was on like a timer, actually a mechanical timer and they implant it in an organ or gland that's affected.\n\n \r\nAnd I know one fellow who's lived seven years beyond it.\n\n So, he's doing okay, but others I've seen are not make it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn a case like that ever thought of doing the chemo or something like that to keep the person alive long enough to get to perhaps a raw diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n I have a lot of those, but only about 60% have made it beyond so many years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut the lady in scientology, did she continue the chemotherapy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, she wouldn't do it, it was killing her?\n\n She stopped and then she was introduced to this diet.\n\n She was doing much better, doing great and then a year ago it started coming back, but she didn't come to me until a few months ago so it was too late.\n\n Unless she ate fecal matter, she wouldn't do it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThat would've made a big difference.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat would've made a big difference?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Clay Blankets \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, clay does contain some ultraviolet rays, and they do contain the magnetic fields and I have seen them work\n\n I’ve seen the blankets, Nikken has them also, which has the clay in them.\n\n The magnetics and the ultraviolet rays, which help people heal.\n\n \r\nSo, those can be beneficial.\n\n Just remember don't overdo anything.\n\n When I was doing tests on them between 1990 and 1993, I found that the people who were sleeping on the bed every night more than five hours after about six weeks if would cause more of a toxic effect on this diet.\n\n On a toxic cooked diet, of course, they're always having more toxins, more electromagnetic problems.\n\n \r\nSo, it's beneficial for them to be on it eight hours a day, every day, and it's fine.\n\n But on this diet, you don't want to be on it more than five hours a day for about six weeks, then off for about six weeks, on and off.\n\n Probably be safer to do 6 weeks on, 6 weeks off, 3 weeks on, 6 weeks off, 3 weeks on, 6 weeks off and a pattern like that.\n\n And it's a big- under your blankets and stuff, pad over the magnetic cushion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI just wanted to ask, you said ultraviolet light is good for you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, ultraviolet when it's from clay?\n\n Not light, sunlight yes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nNot from a tanning bed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, those are very toxic?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Coconut Cream \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, you can do that, but you know, it'll go in and dissolve toxic fat products, old cholesterols, and now there's your right solvent to break down arterial congestion is coconut dream, you can have it with anything\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat is coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen you take coconut meat and separate it from the fat?\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, what I do is I put in four-ounce jelly jars, so they're pretty full, so I'm only getting one at a time and they'll last quite a while.\n\n If your champion juicers getting too hot, it's going to ferment it.\n\n So, what I do is I'll take the blades with the teeth, the teeth on that part that goes on the shaft of the champion.\n\n \r\n\r\nI put olive oil in there, about half a teaspoon of olive oil, I'll rotate it and then I'll shove it on the shaft, it causes a suction and the food gets behind that gear that goes on there, the key that goes on there, it causes the whole gear to move the whole blades to move forward and it cuts off the space for the pulp to come out.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it stays in here and heats up.\n\n If you have the suction in, it keeps it back.\n\n So, it's harder to move that blade forward.\n\n And also, if you take the front end while you're juicing and push down on the front and bend it, it'll shut that whole tooth or a gear back onto the back of the shaft and allow the pulp to come out and down over here.\n\n And then you can pass the coconut cream, coconut pulp two to three times.\n\n Now green life, you don't have to worry about that at all.\n\n That doesn't matter.\n\n Yeah, it doesn't work with coconut very well at all.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, you don't get as much out of that.\n\n It's the air, the air is pushing through the fat and that oxidizes it.\n\n So, it won't but 48 hours, 72 hours.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, you get another 2 ounces out of it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (5) Cooking With Coconut Oil \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, that's 96 degrees for fats is the highest it can go without causing some problems\n\n Formation of toxic fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey said coconut oil is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey say olive oil is too?\n\n I can show you a terrible reaction, they say you can cook with olive oil because it's stable.\n\n I can show you many cases where it creates damage, swelling in the throat, thyroid exhaustion.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJames is selling coconut cream in bottles now, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's good?\n\n That's good stuff.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n It's pressed by a company- oh no, he's not selling it from them, they're pressed by somebody else.\n\n The Beverly Hills Juice Club in West Hollywood, you can call them on Tuesdays or Fridays between 8:00 and 9:00 and they'll press as much as you want, coconut.\n\n\r\nSo, you don't have to go through all that cracking and cutting and putting it in the juicer.\n\n And James Stewart is now carrying it, so you pick up on Wednesday's and Saturday's.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDid you know about the coconut juice they're selling at Trader Joe's.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all heated, very high.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Cotton Balls Have Mercury \n \nAs an antiseptic\n\n So, you have to get a non-sterilized cotton ball, you know, like furniture cotton, organic cotton.\n\n If it's organic cotton, it's not going to be contaminated and I think there are some facial cottons that you can get from health food stores or cotton balls that are organic.\n\n \r\nIf it's organic that means they're not sterilized it with mercury.\n\n Remember the pharmaceutical industry loves use mercury as an antibiotic, and an antiseptic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Different Meats HealignEffects \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, just like in building the high bacteria in the different meats will help break down the toxicity in those tissues\n\n Chicken and all fowl relate to all tissue in the body that is not red and deep red in the body.\n\n Glands like liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, they are all deep red, they're effected by red meat, beef, lamb, Buffalo, venison, all of those.\n\n White meats like rabbit, fowl apply to lymphatic systems, skin, bone, cartilage, neurological tissue, including the myelin, skin hair, all of that is more effected by those white needs, \r\nThe tissue of the brain, the actual inner workings of the brain, the fluids of the brain are affected more by fish, seafood.\n\n So, if you have high fish, you'll help detoxify the inner workings of the brain and neurological system better.\n\n If you have other white meats like the foul and the rabbit, you will detoxify the skin, the lymph, everything else that I mentioned, and the beef, course the darker organs, the blood and the muscles.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, well, I'm relatively new.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHave you read the book.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI read the book about three weeks ago?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThen you get to ask a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, okay.\n\n Well, my problem for one I'm sort of a health nut, and you got a lot more real to me after I read your book because I know you've been through all those.\n\n I reached a point about 10 years ago whenever I tried, I just couldn't get any better and then I had a back injury and I've just had too much weight since then and I'm just happy to hear the weight is okay, it's not necessarily something that you see as a problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut your weights a problem if you've got a back injury.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, that's all that's gotten steadily better actually, I'm happy with- \r\n\n \r\nGood, just lose the weight and gain a different weight, but you should never get that big again on this diet.\n\n \r\nThe heaviest people get at your age is maybe 35 pounds overweight and you're about 50.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, I'm embarrassed, I'm actually quite small boned.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you're not.\n\n Let me see your wrists.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n you're not small boned.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Dirrhea Too Much Fat \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I see people with large adhesions of scar tissue, which are dead cells that do not function, they're just like bricks holding you together\n\n Or if you can't resolve them, it's compound adhesions because your body can't resolve the dead cells, I've seen people with huge adhesions still function with their bladder.\n\n \r\nI would say if you're having diarrhea about every time, you eat your fat or very, very loose stools.\n\n You're not digesting them so well.\n\n I can tell how much cream I can eat.\n\n When I first started on eating raw meat, I started drinking court of raw cream a day with a quart of carrot juice.\n\n It made me feel wonderful and I loved it.\n\n \r\nI blew up, you know, got like Arnold Schwarzenegger and a little puffier in the face than he did cause I didn't work out, he did.\n\n And it felt really good, but I always had loose stools from it.\n\n If I have, let's say eight ounces of cream at a time with berries, I will get very loose stools and I'll be able to judge from thatbhow much I'm digesting and not digesting.\n\n And I'd probably be able to digest very well only six ounces at a time, cream at a time.\n\n So, you have to eat a tremendous amount of fat to not digest it properly usually.\n\n I've had that the vagotomy, so my digestion is compromised.\n\n So, if I can have six ounces most people can do a lot better than that.\n\n \r\nCream is the hardest to digest of the raw fat.\n\n Um, as far as it causes swelling, puffiness as far as actual digestion, for breaking it down the assimilating, avocado is the hardest.\n\n So, if you have difficulty with avocado, then you might want to decrease your consumption of avocado.\n\n If you have massive swelling, water retention, you may be eating too much cream.\n\n \r\nYou may have more butter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) EMFs \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe damaged tissue is not coming out quickly\n\n You have a lot of stored toxic fats in your body.\n\n So, your minerals are probably being absorbed a lot around there.\n\n So, if you want to increase the healing to that finger, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in like a flannel pillowcase, and just put your hand on top of it while you sleep.\n\n \r\n\r\nOr while you're sitting down anywhere, and it'll force circulation into that area for healing.\n\n Anytime you want to force healing in a particular area, use hot water bottles, never a heating pad.\n\n Heating pad contains EMF, electromagnetic fields, and it causes molecular change of cells, which are destructive and there they don't reproduce properly.\n\n It'll cause more adhesions.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nLikewise with electric heating blankets.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nAre space heaters okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nKeep them three feet away from you, it'll also cause electromagnetic fields in the air?\n\n I don't think it's a good idea.\n\n If you're going to use something like that use the radiators, the oil filled.\n\n They're less contaminated.\n\n Or gas.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you cut your finger, just put a hot water bottle on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, you don't put it on top of the hand because that'll cut the circulation off, if you put your hand on top of the hot water bottle heat will radiate up into hand?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nElectric massager.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's not good?\n\n I put my EMF meter on there.\n\n Very high electric, an electric massage chair.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n, it's got a motor that runs it.\n\n The motor's right under here and they'll send out EMS for up to three feet.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nDo these things help as far as EMS are concerned, do you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nUm, is that a magnetic?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n \r\n\r\nNikken's got these magnetic patches and pocket things, that'll will help pull some of it out and regulate your system a little bit.\n\n Their beds work to an extent, as long as you don't overdo it.\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n \r\n\r\nIs the Q-Link something you recommend.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nThis is a Q-Link?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat is that, I don't know what Q-Link is.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nNo sense in going into it if you don't know what it is?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I may, Q-Link I'm not familiar with that name, but I know about the magnetics.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's supposed to regulate magnetic fields, so they're no longer damaging to the body.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (10) Eyeliner \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, wipe that off of your eyes\n\n If you take your little eye thing, you know your eye curler, eyelash curler with egg white on it.\n\n It makes them very dark and thick.\n\n So, there's a beauty kit for you.\n\n  \r\nWhen I used to do acting that's what I did to make my eyelashes thick, take a little paintbrush with egg white and brushed it on my eyelashes and went like this, that was all I did.\n\n Because I didn't want them to put, cause you'd go on the set, like soaps to make everybody's look pretty and I was in the general hospital for five and a half years.\n\n We put mascara on, no way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs it okay for eyeliner.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat I suggest people do is take blueberry or some berry, press it and just take a paint brush and paint it on, it will stain.\n\n \r\nJust put a touch of vinegar in it and it will set like an Easter egg.\n\n Put it on your lips \r\nWell, when I was on stage, that's what I would do.\n\n It works very well.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Eyesight \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nLong term effects on your eyesight\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's very individual.\n\n Most people that get on the diet are beyond thirty.\n\n Usually, the toxicity and scarring is already set in the eyes.\n\n So, reversing that may take 15 to 20 years on the diet.\n\n I had 15, the only healthy things about me my whole life was my eyesight.\n\n As a child I could see the hairs on a fly's legs without magnification, and I could read a magazine from that picture over there to here.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen I got cancer of the face, when that aerospace epoxy came out of my bone in the nose and the cancer burned my nose away, a third of my nose away, it burned a hole in here and a hole in my head here, the acid ran down and burned that eye.\n\n So, that damaged the sight in this eye.\n\n They said that I'd never be able to see out of it properly without a lens transplant, anybody want to donate.\n\n Anyway, it was very thick adhesion, it was probably about 8 to 10 layers, depending upon the area and I keep taking photographs of it at different angles to see each year whether it's diminished and the layers have diminished down to just two now.\n\n So, the eyes are healing.\n\n \r\n\r\nThere are other people whose eyes improve greatly.\n\n Those people are people who usually put egg white in their eye or butter in their eye every other day or once or twice a week and those people's lives improve on a steady basis, but you actually have to treat the eye directly I found to implement that \r\n\r\nOh, this eye.\n\n It's improving, I can't tell your eye lashes apart, but I can see out of it much better?\n\n  \r\n\r\nI can tell who you are very well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs there any reason it's better to do it only once or twice a week or every other day, rather than every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI would say it depends upon your eye.\n\n A lot of people who tried putting butter in their eye, it becomes so thick, you can only put a drop in it.\n\n You lie back and you have to let it sit with your eyes closed for 10 minutes for it to completely melt and let it absorb.\n\n Otherwise, if you walk around like this, trying to see with butter in your eyes it will stay cool, it won't absorb and you've got this film over your eye.\n\n You won't be able to see very well, but an egg white you can put that right in and see perfectly and not wipe it away and not have to keep your eyes closed, but the oil may be a little too- \r\n\r\nI've seen a few people put oil and butter in, two and three times a day, every day and then all of a sudden it will cause a massive eye detox and they start putting out sand.\n\n I think that's a hell of a forced detox and people have improved their vision quicker, but you know, you may be impaired of vision for a day or two.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat is functioning, you can't go out if you've got sand in your eye.\n\n You've got to lie there and just let it get through the center of your eye to get it out.\n\n If it keeps coming out during the day, you can't function.\n\n Imagine driving and all of a sudden one comes into your eye, \r\n\r\nBut that takes, I think it took something like three weeks before one person.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n doing it every day three times a day.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (12) Fecal Matter Tumor Cancer \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, as I was talking about fecal matter, was the only thing that I've seen stop that kind of metastasis\n\n When you metastasize that much, that means it's pretty fast growth, pretty fast.\n\n I can't imagine that they're benign if you have that many in various areas.\n\n I have seen it occasionally, but not very often?\n\n Benign tumors, very hard to dissolve.\n\n \r\nCoconut cream is your best, using coconut cream with a little bit of pineapple is helpful to dissolve tumor, but with that many it all depends.\n\n See, when the cells go malignant, that's a good thing because only malignant tumors can be resolved overnight because with the malignant tumor, the malignant cell has like a battery acid in it, and mostly in tumors you have one light cancer cell surrounded by 50 dead cells.\n\n \r\nThe cancer cells like a hermit, like a monk.\n\n It's very psychic.\n\n You can keep the body in communication with that area.\n\n So, it can keep that body, that part of the body alive, even though it's in this state of disease.\n\n Benign tumor can't do that.\n\n There's no connection with that area of the body.\n\n So, when the cancer cell dies and sets out the serum that dissolves all the cells around them.\n\n That's why you can have remission overnight.\n\n You dissolve within 2 to 7 days a huge tumor like they did at the University of Toronto using E.\n\ncoli verotoxin, dissolved brain tumors from 2 to 7 days,  \r\nSo, fecal matter is your best way to make sure that it's done, so you arrest it.\n\n \r\nIf you go in for a biopsy, you're opening yourself to a tremendous amount of metastasis.\n\n**[SKIP TO 4:40]**\n \r\nWell, you said that you may have tumors many areas of your body, it's not just one.\n\n If you've got them in many areas your body, you're going to be one of those people who suffers.\n\n It doesn't matter whether you have it or not, you know, enjoy your life while you're here.\n\n \r\nI tell every cancer client that comes to me, count on dying and do what it takes not to die.\n\n Like when I went through my stuff, I wanted to die, I was in so much pain.\n\n I was so crippled by those fucking doctors and the drugs that I was crawling around on my elbows like a worm, and it was a miserable life and I was always in pain, severe back pain intestinal pain, leg pain.\n\n \r\nThat's what they did to me, and I just chose that I would never go to them again.\n\n I'd rather die and the people who die on this diet die usually pretty pleasantly, they don't make it \r\nNo, I wouldn't say that entirely because some people feel they have to do it.\n\n It is my approach that I would never do it, never.\n\n When it's my time to go, I'll go, but most people who are on this diet and have cancer reverse it because they haven't had chemo and radiation.\n\n I'll tell you, now that I've been working since the books been published and people who've had chemo and radiation and surgery, the reversal rate is way down to about 60% and I'm not even 5 years yet.\n\n So, it could go down to 50, 40%, still better than the medical profession because theirs is around 11 to 17% after five years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI remember one time you shared that if people did nothing at all.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n76% reverse on their own, but that was back in the forties, fifties, and sixties.\n\n We have about a 4,200 more chemicals.\n\n We're exposed to a lot more contamination.\n\n So, the rate I would say probably 60% would naturally reverse it if people did nothing cause cancers like a flu.\n\n It's a collection of dead cells.\n\n \r\nOnce your liver gets working again makes you proper solvents to dissolve the dead cells.\n\n Your body doesn't collect them anymore.\n\n There's no tumors.\n\n We've reversed.\n\n \r\nOh, yeah.\n\n Yeah.\n\n Most people go through cancer three or four or five times in their life and never know it and since they don't know it, never have a problem with it, they're never diagnosed and there's no harm.\n\n When you go to the doctor, let me tell you, they're trained to terrorize you and they do.\n\n \r\nNo way, you know how fast the FDA would come down on me.\n\n \r\nYeah.\n\n I would definitely recommend that she does the fecal matter, definitely.\n\n \r\nWell, it's so small, it's not enough for her.\n\n Not in a situation like that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDo you have to have half a pound.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no, I recommended she had an ounce every day for five days off, six days on five days, and then maybe three months later doing it again and seeing how it does?\n\n She may even need it more.\n\n She keeps metastasizing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCan people do it even if they don't have cancer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCertainly because almost everybody has cancer, it's just not detected yet?\n\n \r\nNo, because then you'll damage bacteria, kill the bacteria.\n\n \r\nLet me tell you, if you like overcooked broccoli mixed with brussels sprouts, you would love it, that would make me vomit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCould you hypnotize someone to believe they're eating something delicious.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou do that against the law?\n\n You could get in trouble for practicing psychology without a license.\n\n Talk to this man about that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Flower Oils \n \n \n \n \n### (14) Fruitarian \n \n \n \n \n### (15) Getting Off Medication - Throid \n \n \n \n \n### (16) Hairspray \n \n \n \n \n### (17) High Meat \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUp until a year ago when I ate the eight ounces of high fish, it removed 20% of my brain scarring in a matter of about four months, going through the meningitis from eating that eight ounces of high fish, that was a difficult, difficult detox for a while\n\n I was in severe pain.\n\n\r\nI would say I had the effects for about six weeks, from minor to major, to minor again until it was all over.\n\n Severe pain lasting for that 10 days where it peaked about three days where Lorie was lifting my legs onto the couch because I couldn't move anything from the waist down without severe pain and sleeping in the bathtub and that lasted probably 6 days.\n\n\r\nThree days where I couldn't do it myself.\n\n\r\nAnd I ate eight ounces, which is way too much.\n\n High fish, it's letting meat rot on its own, you know decompose on its own with its own bacteria.\n\n So, what you do is you chop it up, you put it in a jar with equal amount of air.\n\n You have to take it out of the house if you don't want to stink up your house.\n\n\r\nTake it out of the house, open it every three to four days, move the jar in the air just twice in a figure eight.\n\n Um, put the lid back on tightly cause there's a gas that's built that'll leak out into your refrigerator, you know, open them and let the gas out.\n\n A lot of people will do that, I just don't feel like doing it for a week or two weeks or three weeks and it's gas keeps building up in there and it just leaks out in the refrigerator.\n\n They say I have a tight lid on that, why is it stinking so badly.\n\n Because hell, you got to take it outside and let it air! And anyway, the bacteria stops growing because it's aerobic bacteria, so it needs to progress through all of its stages and if you don't take it out every three to four days, it goes dormant at that point?\n\n Doesn't meat you can't use it, it just sort of goes dormant and it takes an exposure and the least three, four days for the bacteria to get active again where you can take it.\n\n If you take it when it's not active, it just won't be much good.\n\n You're just taking stinky meat.\n\n\r\nAnd what that stinky meat does is.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n your body cleans itself in three ways.\n\n I say this at every meeting, it's probably one of the most important things I talk about.\n\n You use solvent, just like we use degreasers and compounds to dissolve other compounds, whether it's plastic, wood, and metal.\n\n No matter what it is in the body, if it's inorganic, that's the only way your body can dissolve those toxins because bacteria, parasites, molds, they will not break down inorganic material from pollution, cooked foods, stuff like that that stores in the body.\n\n So, your body has to make these solvents and does it from about 80% fat, 15% protein and 5% alcohol, which your body makes from fermenting carbohydrates in the body.\n\n So, it goes in and dissolves whatever's in the body that needs to be dissolved.\n\n Some people have no bacteria.\n\n People like me who have had intense radiation and chemotherapy, it poisons the whole system so parasites, bacteria can't live in the body.\n\n So, the body has to do only the solvent process.\n\n It's a very slow, tedious process and one of the byproducts of it is identical turpentine and it's as as toxic to the human body.\n\n So, it creates a low grade lethargy, maybe depression, fatigue.\n\n\r\nSo, the body isn't real happy when it has to go through that and you'll see people eat the high meat that they make after about four weeks, you need to let it go four weeks.\n\n If you eat that, all of a sudden you get this high, because what you've done is introduced bacteria into the body and all of a sudden the body doesn't have to use only the solvent process, which is slow and very toxic.\n\n\r\nSo, the body can use virus, bacteria, molds, yeasts.\n\n Yeast is a mold and to dissolve compounds in your body.\n\n So, your body has health.\n\n It doesn't have to do everything on its own.\n\n It's like, let's say you were the only person in this room and we piled garbage all over the place and you had to stay and clean it up all by yourself and you had 24 hours to do it and would take you 80 hours to do on your own.\n\n\r\nSo, then all of a sudden we bring a bunch of people in here to help you to do it.\n\n That's what happens when you eat the high meats, high bacteria meats.\n\n Introducing bacteria into the body to help you clean up the garbage and the byproducts from the virus, the bacteria and the molds working.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) High Meat First TIme \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe first time was when 1975 when I met the Eskimos\n\n I still had bone cancer, blood and bone was coming back again.\n\n I was traveling around on a bicycle all over the United States, Mexico and Canada and Alaska.\n\n Living with different tribes and animals, alligators, coyotes, you know, chipmunks and studied them in different tribal groups.\n\n \r\nWell, when I went to Alaska, this is in September of 95.\n\n Um, it was getting cold, you know, Alaska gets cold pretty quickly in September.\n\n It was getting down to about 48 degrees at night.\n\n With my multiple myeloma surging, if the temperature went below 48 degrees, I was crippled.\n\n I was in so much pain I couldn't move.\n\n Couldn't move even my fingers.\n\n I couldn't twitch my ears and my eyebrows or anything without severe pain.\n\n So.\n\n I would keep very warm at night, as warm as I could.\n\n and as soon as the sun went down I would bundle, but they tried to get me to eat raw meat like crazy up there and I wouldn't do it because I was such a diehard vegetarian, and I had such an ill reaction to cooked meat.\n\n Never dawned on me the difference between all raw foods and cooked foods.\n\n \r\nSo, I refused to do it and one day we dug up these pouches, they were these things that were wrapped in hide and buried under the ground between two and six inches.\n\n It stunk horribly, I mean they had somebody down there and they could tell how bad it stunk and if it didn't stink a half mile down wind, it wasn't ready, so they wrapped it and put it back in the ground.\n\n \r\nWhen I got there, they started doing this, I thought what the hell is this, maybe it's some herbs or something because when they unwrapped it, I could see this green mold, white and black mold.\n\n I didn't know that meat did that.\n\n I had no consciousness with meat to have those kinds of molds growing on it.\n\n  \r\nSo, when it came time that it was ripe smell was so horrific that I couldn't get within five feet of it without wanting to vomit.\n\n All the children were around it, they smelled it and they were jumping up and down like this, and the adults were all happy.\n\n This shit is so bad I'm saying to myself, oh my God.\n\n I thought it was, you know, I thought they were herbs that rotted, some kid of mulch in them, some kind of seaweed in them cause it smelled so bad.\n\n Uh, it did smell slightly animal, so I figured it was seaweed.\n\n Seaweed can stink horribly because it's part of the animal, like a mushroom is part animal and part plant.\n\n  \r\nSo, they unwrapped it and gave me a golf ball sized amount and I had to put cotton balls up my nose with musk oil.\n\n \r\nSo, I pushed it up my nose, you know, that smelled good, but still I could barely detect it, I was able to eat it and within about two or three hours, all of a sudden, all my joints felt warm, and this was in the late afternoon when the sun was starting to go down and I stayed there for a total of 28 days and I was not crippled in pain.\n\n I mean, I was in pain, but I was not crippled for that whole time.\n\n Now, years later when I read the culture and what they wrap in those hides and buried, I found out it was meat.\n\n So, I realized that I needed meat, but this wasn't until the early eighties and that's when I started molding other foods, molding\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) How Much Fruit WIthout Reaction \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThen I don't have a craving for carrot juice as often\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIf you find that you eat more fruit and don't have any reaction, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, but a lot of people can't determine on their own when they're emotionally involved in their own issues and their own stuff?\n\n They don't see that they're having a problem, like this girl doesn't see that she's having a problem, but everybody around her has commented about it to me.\n\n So, she's not able to see that it's too much.\n\n \r\nAnd I tried to have a conversation with her about it and she got very upset, said, \"I feel great, what do you mean.\n\n This is a great diet!\"?\n\n She said, \"my raw diet is great.\n\n\" Said I don't know how you can eat what you do because I wouldn't be enjoying it, I love the taste of my food.\n\n \r\nUm, well, I would say, you know, let somebody around who is close to you knows you be, uh, be a mirror or a sounding board.\n\n Um, you know, I can be clear about it now because I've been there and, and I'm removed from it.\n\n But when I'm there, you know, like last summer I tried to do a lot of fruits for week and.\n\n I didn't see it at first, but all of a sudden, one day I realized I was getting irritable again, getting too excited to your roles and sexual all of it.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, can I try adding more fruit \r\n\n \r\nWell, I would say let somebody around you who's close to you be a mirror, be s sounding board.\n\n I can be clear about it now because I've been there and I'm removing from it, but when I'm there, like last summer I tried to do a lot of summer for a week and I didn't see it at first, but all of a sudden one day I noticed I was getting irritable again.\n\n Too excited, too irritable, too sexual.\n\n All of it.\n\n Of course, I'm a diabetic so.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoesn't fruit help with weight gain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot necessarily?\n\n Usually, a lot of fruit interferes with weight gain because it breaks the sugars down and makes them into fuel instead of allowing muscle.\n\n She's not good with it.\n\n I've seen only a few people who can eat a lot of fruit, maybe a fruitarian diet and function, and think and they do very well, but it's very few.\n\n \r\nWell, one of them was a 70-year-old man and about two years ago he started having problems, so he started eating meat.\n\n So, you know, the others aren't that old yet, he the oldest.\n\n \r\nWhen he hits 70 years old, I think David's gonna have a problem.\n\n 60-65.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) How To Gain Weigh \n \n \n \n \n### (21) Kefir \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nMix it with certain foods, it neutralizes the bacteria, just milk is okay\n\n When you put it with egg it neutralizes the bacteria, honey it'll definitely neutralize the bacteria.\n\n \r\nI don't know a yogurt that's raw.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUm, well, I don't eat that?\n\n The reason I don't eat it is because when they take a bacteria to make a yogurt or a kefir, they wash it, and that bacteria is never what it was us in the beginning.\n\n And every time they wash it in city water, there's new chemicals that are changing that bacteria.\n\n \r\nI like to make my own kefir, my own yogurt with my own milk from its own bacteria.\n\n So, I'll put it in a dark cupboard, upper cupboard in the winter where it's warmer, lower cupboard in the summer where it's cooler.\n\n You have a very low ratio of time to be able to drink it all before it separates in the cottage cheese, but still, that's the way I prefer it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThe bacteria in kefir, isn't that from grains.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSome of it's from rennet, which is from the enzymes in a cow's stomach?\n\n  \r\nThat's what I'm saying, I don't use any.\n\n Most starters like she said are from vegetables, they're not the natural bacteria in milk.\n\n  \r\nIt's the type of bacteria that you put in it, one that'll thicken heavily.\n\n They're about four varieties.\n\n that'll make it thicken a lot, only when the milk is heated.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, you put bacteria in your-.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I'm saying I do not?\n\n  \r\nIt'll go, it'll go into Kefir and then it'll go into yogurt, then cottage cheese.\n\n \r\nIt will go if you let it sit.\n\n \r\nIn the fridge it still won't go into cottage cheese unless it's made that cycle.\n\n Yeah, most of the time it will.\n\n If you put honey in it, that helps to go into kefir and a yogurt very nicely and keeps it from going into cottage cheese and then you can refrigerate them.\n\n That'll keep much better.\n\n I use about 2 tablespoons per quart.\n\n \r\nYou can spit in it if you want your own enzymes if you want to have your own medicine.\n\n So, your own enzymes are in the milk pre-digesting it, then expectorating into it.\n\n You know, maybe you know about a teaspoon of spit in there.\n\n \r\nNo.\n\n I usually wait until the milk is room temperature, then I'll put the honey in it and then I'll just sit there and nurture it for a while when I'm reading or doing something and set it because once it mixes finely it doesn't separate again.\n\n Well, keep it in a dark space anyway and then when it becomes room temperature I add the honey, shake it and put it back in the dark place.\n\n Shaking it to get the honey to mix in more.\n\n \r\nIt depends on how cold the honey is.\n\n I keep my house very cold, except in the summer I don't need much, I rarely use the heat just when patients are coming over.\n\n So, everything is very cold.\n\n So, for me, it sometimes takes five minutes of, you know, just going like this and that to do that, but in the summer, it takes about a minute, and it'll dissolve.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow long does it take without the honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWithout the honey, it depends upon room temperature and temperature of the milk?\n\n It takes anywhere from, in the winter and a cold house, like mine would say it's 60 degrees in my house or 57 degrees.\n\n It could take three days.\n\n If it's 80 degrees in my house, it could take a day and a half to get to kefir state and then another 10 to 12 hours in that kind of heat to get to the yogurt state and then you have a very brief period where it'll go into cottage cheese, separate into it, but with the honey in it, it doesn't do that as well.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhen you're eating certain cheeses, they also have certain bacteria's.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n When you're eating cheeses you're eating a mold, you're eating a moldy food and that helps clean out a lot of garbage because it pulls poisons to the stomach and intestines and binds with them.\n\n You don't really digest much cheese; cheese is there as an absorbent.\n\n \r\nAlso, what'll happen is it'll help you utilize a lot of healthy minerals.\n\n So, you bind those minerals from your juice and your other foods to bind with poisons.\n\n The minerals in the cheese will do that and leave your other minerals for utilization in the body.\n\n So, it's great to get rid of pain.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Loss Of Period \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen your period stops, I haven't had it in 8 months\n\n \r\n[Aa \r\nIt just means that your ovaries are not producing eggs and you may be going through a menopause?\n\n Did you not have any hot flashes and all that, most women who have been on this diet for many years, when they go into menopause, there is no problem.\n\n They don't have heat flashes; they don't have all that discomfort.\n\n They don't have any problems.\n\n Women who go on the diet when they're already into it, it usually doesn't stop right away.\n\n Usually has its year/ 2 year cycle and some people even continue it.\n\n Are you still continuing your heat flashes.\n\n And how long have you been?\n\n 4 years and she's still in hers.\n\n So, it depends upon the individual.\n\n \r\nShe's trying to do a lot to do it, but Kathy was like me.\n\n She was very, very ill when she started the diet.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Mercury \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\n5% of the people it contaminates\n\n A good way to get mercury out of the body is by eating cilantro, about 10% of your juice.\n\n Cilantro is a good metal absorber, especially mercury, eating raw fish to tie natural mercury like swordfish.\n\n \r\nSee with the plankton, which they eat, which naturally is high in mercury, handles and makes mercury a living substance, which is beneficial.\n\n \r\nIt helps the buoyancy for like the swordfish.\n\n All those animals are very buoyant, even the dolphins because they have high mercury content, but it's organic, bioactive mercury.\n\n Once you cook it, you cauterized it, it's a free radical, and it's a toxin.\n\n So, as long as you don't cook your fish, it's a very beneficial mercury.\n\n \r\nIt won't help you be buoyant because mostly it will be used to pull poison mercury's out of your system.\n\n \r\nMercury's, there are three forms of mercury, there's organic, there's inorganic and vapor mercury.\n\n The vapor will crystal, say like you had mercury fillings, amalgam fillings.\n\n They're 50% mercury.\n\n They let off a gas every time you're chewing on something that's acidic, that gas crystallizes in your system as it's absorbed, the lungs and into the stomach, into the tissue and crystallizes.\n\n So, it leaves little particles of mercury here and there throughout the system.\n\n The mercury is injected into the body.\n\n It's not like that.\n\n You've seen mercury where you put it down, you know, beads are mercury.\n\n They'll just crawl and find each other.\n\n \r\nThat's the way it reacts in the body when it's injected in the body.\n\n So, you have these massive mercury deposits in the brain.\n\n That's happens in the brain of children with autism or death.\n\n \r\nNo, he asked, when you use lemon or lime with the fish, does that make it a toxic mercury.\n\n No, it is not.\n\n It's like the digestive juices in the stomach.\n\n It starts taking the parts apart, but it doesn't cauterize it.\n\n It doesn't warp them.\n\n \r\nIf there's many Mercuries to be bioactive, you'll have fish tissue with it.\n\n \r\nUm, let me finish the thing about the mercury.\n\n When the plankton eats the mercury.\n\n Just like any plant can take strychnine, led to be very healthy with a trace amount of it because it's taking the minerals from the earth and strychnine, mercury are all minerals from the earth.\n\n Well from the ocean that's y'know, earth in general, not soil.\n\n It takes those substances and makes them useful within a system.\n\n and it can do it with a certain level and plankton is very good at utilizing mercury and making it useful to living creatures.\n\n So, the other creatures that feed on plankton and the other creatures that feed on the animals that feed on the plankton get high levels of organic mercury, makes them very buoyant.\n\n \r\nThey're much more in the ocean than they could without the mercury.\n\n Once you take that mercury, and once you take that meat from the creatures who have that mercury and you cook it, you completely fractionate all the life.\n\n It's like I come in here and I blast you with either, um, you know, some kind of acid, caustic acid that's not a vegetable or I take a big flame blower, I melt you guys.\n\n Okay.\n\n Basically, all of the ability to maintain a light form is gone.\n\n You eliminate everything that causes that interaction to make this whole system full and mobile and active.\n\n So then those little trace amounts of mercury then are poison.\n\n \r\nIf you come into contact with or eat them, then they are poisoning the system.\n\n They are free radicals, like I talked about the proton being separated from the neutrons and it'll bombard and split and slice as when mercury does, when it's not organically bioactive.\n\n \r\nOh, yes.\n\n Metal poisoning has gone into probably the nerves and the joint and all the connective tissue, so they're constantly irritated.\n\n The problem I find with it on this diet, even on this diet is that that's probably one of the hardest to reverse because I need to put them in the stage and it almost gets them into lupus and they either go into lupus or they don't.\n\n And I've had 3 clients go into lupus and it's hell.\n\n  \r\nYou know, you need to get lots of fat on their connective tissues.\n\n That's cream and butter, get in there and absorb the fat.\n\n Whether they make it through with that kind of poison is very difficult to judge.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, the raw fat is absorbing the cooked fat, is that what you mean by absorbing the fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the fats absorb the toxic metals from the chelation therapy?\n\n**[Roger]**\n \r\nPeople who've had a bypass to clean up the artery and the veins.\n\n They claim that it goes out through the kidneys.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPeople who are not on this diet, 90% of the people I know who've gotten chelation therapy.\n\n First person I met who got chelation therapy was in 1971.\n\n That was when they first started chelation therapy, 90% of them had died.\n\n Without being on this diet.\n\n I've had 4 people who had 30 to 50 chelation treatments who died.\n\n \r\nWell, they didn't stick strictly because one person in Sacramento.\n\n Somebody frightened them, some vegetarian, fighting them into saying that no, he's going to store the fats again in his arteries.\n\n so he stopped doing the diet for about three months and he died in that time, and I talked to his wife and she said that when he was on your diet did so well and then when he got afraid, somebody scared him.\n\n About a year and a half after starting the diet scared him to stop eating all that fat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Mercury Iodine Swelling \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNot necessarily, usually that kind of pain, what usually happens when they perform a surgery on someone who has a spine injury, and any kind of surgery, they'll use Merthiolate, mercurochrome or iodine, as an antiseptic\n\n Mercurochrome and Merthiolate are all liquid mercury, very poisonous.\n\n So, they coat that area, causes severe toxicity in that area, causing pain, causes swelling, doctors who use that are very ignorant.\n\n \r\nThey just don't observe what's happening over the long run.\n\n Iodine does the same thing.\n\n Iodine's a little bit more accurate and it milks around the tissue and cause more adhesions by acidity.\n\n Whereas the mercury will just poison cells and cause toxicity that way, either way they're both harmful.\n\n \r\nAnd that's usually the problem in that situation.\n\n Eating berries with cream and butter, coconut cream is the best.\n\n Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, boysenberries, anything strawberries, not so much.\n\n It will help remove the metal poisonings like the mercury and the iodine and then the fats will help dissolve it also and bind with it.\n\n  \r\nCoconut cream is the best.\n\n You take coconut cream after juicing it, when you put it on metal, you'll see.\n\n Within 24 hours, 48 hours, it eats the metal away and turns black.\n\n So, coconut cream is a lot better to remove metals.\n\n Usually what that creates is the same reactions he's having already with your panic attacks, severe depression and suicidal tendencies, even homicidal tendencies.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs there anything that can help him be free of pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if the pain is causing the swelling locally, no?\n\n What he has to do is apply a hot water bottle in the area.\n\n, so that everything will expand.\n\n When you have those poisons in there, it causes a burning of the surrounding tissues.\n\n So, there's always tension.\n\n \r\nIt's like, I, you know, and when that poisons, irritating the nerve tissue, it will constantly cause a contraction in that area that minimizes the blood to the area.\n\n But yet the blood is trying to pump in there.\n\n And then what happens is the nerves get swollen in a tight area.\n\n It's just like the brain; you get a headache.\n\n \r\nThat's from swelling in the brain and your skull is not expanding along with it.\n\n So, if you apply a hot water bottle on three sides while you're lying, when you do.\n\n That will allow the connective tissue to the fishers to expand.\n\n So, the whole brain can expand so that the swelling in the brain doesn't cause pressure on the nerves and cause the headaches usually hot water bottles on three sides, we'll reduce the headaches by about 80%.\n\n \r\nThen you take the pain formula, usually gets rid of it.\n\n So, you start moving again, as long as you're sedentary and still it's good.\n\n You can't give me too many parts too.\n\n If you give me too many parts to the question, I can't answer it every day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Metal Jar Tops Rust \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI haven't had that problem; you may have had a bad batch\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n  \r\nSo, when the rings get rusty even that rust sitting on the glass-  \r\n\n \r\nIt'll fall down and flake down into your food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n  \r\nJust like the discoloration with rust I should just stop using it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely, if I get a scratch if the enamel scratches, then I don't use it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n  \r\nSame with the metal ones if you get a scratch.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't even use the metal ones cause that'll flake right into your food?\n\n I use the enamel tops.\n\n The plastic don't seal as well.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhere do you get your enamel tops.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOn the internet I found a place?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nCan you give us their number.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI remember when I first met you, I had a red mark on my hand?\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEczema.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWas it from metal.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n jars.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNow you're talking about this rim right here.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nLike right on the inside, the flat top part?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay, I've never had that problem because I don't let it get wet and I dry them instantly.\n\n I do not let them sit.\n\n Any of these will rust, hand dry them.\n\n If I wash them, I instantly take my towel and dry them with it because they will rust.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Milkshakes  &Smoothies \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nNever drink a smoothie with meat\n\n Smoothie is with egg and fruit.\n\n If you want you can add milk to it and have other kinds of milkshakes smoothies, but it's not good to have with meat.\n\n \r\nIt's not a good idea because you'll start turning the protein into a pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, and you'll burn it rather than use it to regenerate cells.\n\n So, you won't reversing the aging process, you're just giving yourself a lot more fuel.\n\n \r\nNo, I'm saying the terminology smoothie means fruit in it.\n\n Milkshake means no fruit in it.\n\n Yes, you can have it with meat if you have a very good digestive system.\n\n Like if you have any indigestion or you go too long without hunger, after eating a milkshake with a meat meal, then don't have them together or have less of the milkshake.\n\n \r\nI can't mix a milkshake and meat together and digest it very well.\n\n \r\nTomato is always good with meat.\n\n Tomatoes an acid, so it doesn't interfere with the intestinal bacteria, the acid bacteria.\n\n So, it's always beneficial, however if you're eating zucchini and to cucumber, they can over alkalinize, so you shouldn't have too much.\n\n You're getting the ads.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) More Eyes \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt just happens\n\n People go through different detoxes in different times.\n\n Last year after I forced the meningitis by eating eight ounces of high fish, I had grains coming out of my eye.\n\n Part of the brain dumping because the brain can only dump out the sinuses, the eyes and the ears and the mouth and the gums and the salivary gland.\n\n \r\nI don't recommend it for anybody unless they're very brave.\n\n \r\nYes, this psychologist in Santa Fe, New Mexico came to me about five or six years ago and she's an expert witness for the federal government.\n\n She's like a psychologist that questioned him.\n\n She had interviews with him to determine whether he was sane to go on trial or not.\n\n So, she's pretty high powered.\n\n \r\nShe's had asthma, most of her life and inhalers and prednisone's.\n\n  \r\nShe's down to maybe taking a 10th of her medication and rarely takes an inhaler at all.\n\n She always had red eyes because of that.\n\n So, she always looked stoned when she's up on the witness stand.\n\n So, she says is there anything I can do about it.\n\n And I said, yes, drop a few drops of egg in an eye dropper?\n\n I said drop an egg into a glass, take some egg white out and drop 2 drops into each eye.\n\n  \r\nPut your head back and pull your eyelids completely away from the eye and roll your eyes around for about a minute.\n\n So, she did that about three days a week and about, I think it was about 1 year and 3 months and she was on the diet and she called me in a panic one day, \"My eyes are so bad I can't see, I can't even read signs on the road anymore, this diet isn't working.\n\n\".\n\n \r\nI said wait a minute, you have multiple problems.\n\n The diets taken care of some of them, and you've only been on the diet a year and three months it's not gonna repair you and everything in a year and a year and three months, it takes 40 years to clean up everything.\n\n You build everything five times before you'll be optimal.\n\n So, if you're still having eye deterioration, that's probably because of your medications that you're still taking.\n\n You need to go to the optometrist and get a new prescription.\n\n So, she went to the optometrist and her eyesight was about 20 to 30% better.\n\n So, she had to get a reeducation her prescription.\n\n \r\nThat's the first person I knew that put the egg white in her eyes on a regular basis, but you got an instant improvement.\n\n So, I started suggesting other people wanting to improve their eyes that they put it regularly in the eyes, the egg white and sure enough, in every case of people that continue to degenerate even on the diet their eyesight, it stopped immediately  \r\nAnd for most people it reverses it.\n\n \r\nI'd probably do it at 9:00 AM morning because at night you can kind of use it to help the body clean out any pollution that is absorbed into the eye lining.\n\n And then during morning, just to refresh and feed the eye directly.\n\n \r\nHer eyes use to be very, very bloodshot all the time and now they're much better, so it's working.\n\n \r\nJust the egg white, put the yolk in there you could be clouded, big time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRotten egg in eye.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut then it starts decomposing and it might cause an eye detox, instead of an eye nourishment and feeding.\n\n So, I'd be careful with that, might end up with pink eye.\n\n That's not a bad thing to help, but it's a hell of a thing to go through and everybody thinks you're contagious because the medical profession says it's contagious.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Nuts \n \nI didn't say that they weren't good\n\n I've said that all nuts contain enzyme inhibitors, which prevent you from eating from the jesting, utilizing and assimilating protein from 36 to 48 hours after eating it, unless you eat it in a combination with other foods, which inhibits the enzyme.\n\n So she has my nut formula, which is nuts, egg hunting, and butter, or coconut cream.\n\n\r\nThat combination.\n\n Correct.\n\n It has to be raw nuts.\n\n Almonds are too difficult to digest the softer ones like, um, uh, walnuts, the cons pine nuts, sunflower seeds.\n\n\r\nNo, because then you turn it into a, uh, a vegetable and then you have other enzyme inhibitors that don't mix with what I just described.\n\n\r\nwhen you do this, you put it in the butter or the cream and about.\n\n Uh, two parts, butter cream to one part, the clay.\n\n And I mean, we're talking about, you know, let's say six drops of, uh, of butter or clay, or unless you're making a batch, you keep it refrigerated and you make a larger bag, but it should be about one third clay, two thirds.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Pancreas Heals Slow \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nYes, if it does heal\n\n The pancreas is the only gland gland that I very rarely see heal much and I've been eating raw foods since 1972, almost exclusively and my pancreas was repaired from diabetes only by 15%.\n\n\r\nThis is my experience.\n\n I've only seen a few other people heal their pancreas  very much at all.\n\n Most people will take care of every other gland, but not their pancreas.\n\n It's like the bodies on a sugar strike.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Parasites \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThey're half as toxic is in turpentine lights up and they work twice as fast\n\n Then the third way are parasites, they work five times faster than your body can use the solvent process and a hundred times less toxic.\n\n That's why most people who have parasites don't even know it, but the problem is if you don't eat enough meat to regenerate cells, you have ulcerations, gut exchange, paralysis, death.\n\n \r\nOn this diet eating raw meats, it doesn't have to be high meat, just raw meats to regenerate cells.\n\n Everybody gets well faster, in the animal tests all animals got well faster if they have parasites.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about doing high meat on the standard diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI haven't worked with anybody on that basis, so I would hate to theorize and say?\n\n Well, Dr.\n\n Joel Weinstock at the University of Iowa did experiments where he took six people with a chronic inflammatory bowel syndrome, which is one of the most painful diseases there is cause it's always painful.\n\n If it goes into Crohn's then it even affects the joints and cripples' people, but just the chronic bowel syndrome can cause severe intestinal pain where people can't even move.\n\n They're always in pain, always in diarrhea or constipation, on or the other, it's usually diarrhea.\n\n Very thin, very emaciated people.\n\n So, all of these people that he did experiments with were unaffected by medical treatments.\n\n So, of course the AMA says, oh, you've got a bunch of people that aren't reacting to medical, you can do something alternative and use them as guinea pigs.\n\n So, these six people agreed to it.\n\n They were all elderly people with this disease who had suffered with it for at least 20 years and what he did was he felt that because all the studies showed that all animals have intestinal parasites.\n\n Since the pig is most like our intestinal tract, he took the whip worm from the pigs' intestines, filtered out the eggs, put it in Gatorade and had these people caulk this a parasite egg-Gatorade.\n\n They all got the parasites and five of the six immediately went into remission and stayed there for five months.\n\n \r\nSo, he proved his point.\n\n**[unclear]**\n monkeys and other animals, I don't remember what other animal, if you cleared of bacteria, they got very sick.\n\n cleared them of parasites, they got very sick.\n\n So, he says, cleanliness is not what it's not what it's built up to be.\n\n \r\nWell, what I did, in my experimental, I found out about this, you know, I'm gung ho.\n\n When I looked in the garbage, it's the only place you're going to find massive parasites is in a garbage can outside of the fish market.\n\n So, I went into a garbage outside of the fish market and found a piece of salmon and undulating pinworms and I ate the worms and all and I did not get parasites, but that was only eight years after having all the chemo and radiation.\n\n So, I was still so poisoned that no parasite could live in my body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHigh fish, does that have parasites in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that's mainly bacteria?\n\n If you incubated it the right way and let it sit in a warm temperature eventually it will grow parasites, but we make the high meat in the refrigerator, so it won't generate parasites and doesn't move through the stages.\n\n I also ate calves brain infested with flukes and chicken tripe infested with parasites and I couldn't get one.\n\n I haven't tried it in probably 12 years.\n\n I probably could get them now.\n\n \r\nNo.\n\n It is very hard to tell when you have parasites.\n\n I can't tell with the irises usually, sometimes I can if I'm looking at somebody's eyes over a three month period, and there's a mass change in an area, I can usually tell there's a parasite and I've seen that and I said go check and see if you have parasites, get some test stuff and sure enough, most of the people had parasites in those areas, and then they come back.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen they come back and they have parasites, are they happy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely, throw a party! Well, what I found was that people on this diet aren't affected by them in that way?\n\n Tony fly was an actor who was the second lead in El in El Salvador- he played a double song role, but in the movie called Latino, shot in Nicaragua in like 1986 or 1985.\n\n He was one of my clients.\n\n He brought me a full 11 by a half sheet, a medium sized paper illegal size, 8 1/2 by 14 of all these things not to do when he's down there in the jungle.\n\n Don't drink the water or you wash your hands, don't eat any raw foods, not even a raw salad, boil your water distilled is better, always have your meat more than well done.\n\n And I said, Tony, you do the exact opposite of everything it said, when you're in the swamp drink the swamp water, everything it says not to do you won't get sick.\n\n He'd been eating this diet since about 79 I think he became my client.\n\n A good five years, six years, seven years, he was on the diet and eating lots of meat and all of that.\n\n So, he went down there and they spent three months there.\n\n They went a month and a half over schedule and Haskell Wexler the academy award winning cinematographer.\n\n He was a writer, director, producer and cinematographer of the film.\n\n It was political and about US involvement, just like El Salvador was on Oliver Stone's.\n\n But this wasn't about El Salvador and Latinos it was about Nicaragua and the film was shut down for three weeks because Robert Belton, who was the lead actor got frightfully ill, everybody on the entire set in a three-week period got deathly ill, so they shut the film down.\n\n \r\nTommy's the only one who didn't get sick and he ate the raw meat, he ate the salad and he did everything that they said, not to.\n\n He did not get sick.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo really the body is going into a detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's exactly, that's it, but it's a massive detox?\n\n The body is saying, thank God for this bacteria now let's get the shit out.\n\n Vomit and diarrhea.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs there any viruses are not good for you.\n\n Like hepatitis?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, hepatitis is excellent because usually when a liver gets hepatitis, that liver is shut down?\n\n This is serious progression of liver toxicity.\n\n So you get the hepatitis, any of those hepatitis C, B, H, G, A, any of them are all beneficial.\n\n I've seen them as long as people are on a good die where they're eating raw meats that liver gets well faster than I've ever seen.\n\n \r\nWell, see, they're just going on on speculation.\n\n They speculate that- they believe in the germ theory, which is speculation it has never been proven.\n\n In fact, it's mainly been disproved, yet they hold on to it.\n\n So, they're just, they have no idea.\n\n They don't know anybody who's done a raw meat diet.\n\n They've never tried it themselves and yet they're postulating this bullshit and there's not one clinical test proven that raw meat is a problem.\n\n Not one clinical test in any university.\n\n Not one, and you ask them to show you the science.\n\n Oh, well the CDC says, well, we're a CDC science.\n\n CDC doesn't have it either.\n\n They're the most panic stricken, hysteria mongers in the world because they're all a bunch of doctors who believe in the germ theory.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat is the CDC.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCDC, Central Disease Center?\n\n It should be Control.\n\n \r\nShe said, if you go to any country and they say you should have shots and you should not eat this and that, don't do it.\n\n \r\nWell, you can always get a raw eggs and raw meat anywhere and go for that, lots of raw eggs, raw chicken in Japan to me, I don't care if it's not exit.\n\n Yes, you should not refrigerate eggs, you know.\n\n \r\nI don't care if it's not refrigerated, you should not refrigerate eggs?\n\n Get them to leave them out, get a bunch of them if you know you're going to go through that problem, just live on eggs and keep them out of the refrigerators \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Pollution Of Ocean & Fresh Water \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOkay, let me cut that\n\n The pollution of the ocean is at the most 2%, 2% contamination is not going to be dangerous.\n\n It's going to be so dispersed.\n\n It's not a problem.\n\n Our freshwater lakes are 35% minimum in contaminated, 35% contaminated.\n\n The ocean is only 2%.\n\n \r\nYou've got a much greater risk of causing having a mercury problem in freshwater fish.\n\n Ocean fish are pretty clean, especially swordfish and tuna that are way out in the ocean, spend most of their time way out there.\n\n \r\nWhere most of the ocean is polluted is near the shore.\n\n \r\nNo, it's usually organic mercury.\n\n \r\nMost of the shellfish build the mercury into their shells.\n\n There was a lab test on oysters, clams in a contaminated area from France and some urchins and you could barely find but a trace in the urchin of inorganic mercury and he found lots of it in the shell, so don't eat the shells.\n\n \r\nSo going to shell.\n\n \r\nSure.\n\n I'm the same way I need to show.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Pottenger Fecal Matter \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nEdward Howell, the so-called father of enzyme nutrition did an experiment to copy or to prove Pottenger's work with those 900 cats over a 10-year period to show that you have to prove that yes, cooked foods do create diseases in animals, raw foods allow no for no disease\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, he did this experiment, which is a little over three years.\n\n I forgot how many rats he had, but I think he had 58, 57, something like 60 rats for the first experiment.\n\n Those that ate the cooked foods at the end of their lives in three years had all the diseases of man.\n\n Those that ate raw had no diseases, but they all died three years, and this is very different from Pottenger's work because the cats on cooked food lived one third less than the cats on raw food that didn't have any diseases.\n\n So, he was very concerned about that part of the experiment, didn't know what was happening, thought it was maybe some bacterial activity or something that was happening in the rat, it was unusual.\n\n Maybe they have hormone a hormone that's different from cats.\n\n So, he's going over the notes over and over and over again for a year and finally realized only there was one very peculiar difference, the cats who ate cooked foods, ate their feces, ate each other species, they ate all of it.\n\n They didn't even have to clean out the gate.\n\n They ate all the feces or most of it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, he decided to redo the experiment and sure enough, he put a wire mesh down to the rats when they had a movement, the fecal matter fell through the screen.\n\n They only lived two years instead of three years this time.\n\n So, fecal matter can be very beneficial, all animals know it except for humans, and I used it in the two situations, recommended it for people with very aggressive cancer metastasized all over their systems.\n\n \r\n\r\nOne fellow came to me about four months ago with- this is the third time he's had cancer.\n\n He was only about my age.\n\n I'm 55 in few days.\n\n He's 56 or 57.\n\n It had metastasized this time in the lungs, liver, and testes and he had part of his intestines already moved 10 years earlier in cancer and I think it was in his pancreas.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it was aggressive, he was going quickly and just getting thinner and thinner So, I had a lot of buffalo fecal matter and bowel tissue, and I gave it to him.\n\n I said, what I recommend is you eat at least a tablespoon per day.\n\n 5 days on, 6 days off or about 30 days and I think he did it for only the first week, because I didn't give him much.\n\n I told him where he could get more, I don't think he did, but he was taking morphine because of the pain and every client that I had who was on morphine never made it because it breaks their appetite, and they can't eat enough.\n\n So, they just disintegrate interiorally.\n\n So, what it did for him, that fecal matter allowed him to have a hell of an appetite.\n\n So, he gained 10 pounds in about 10 days and the last time I talked to him, he was up 20 pounds.\n\n So, he was much more focused and able and a little bit bigger than that and that was the first person that I had really, you know, I drove it into him to do it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's very difficult to do with women who have cancer.\n\n I'd say most of the people who come to me with cancer are women and it's very difficult to convince women to start eating shit.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNo, it isn't.\n\n It's not even as bad as high meat because all it does is tastes like overcooked- did your mother ever overcook vegetables.\n\n That's what it tastes like, overcooked vegetables?\n\n It tastes like what it is.\n\n It tastes like vegetables over cooked and if you like vegetables overcooked that'd be fine, but if you're like me I wanna vomit.\n\n So, just swallow it down.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou could wash it down with milk, that's not a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you eat your own.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't recommend it?\n\n I recommend it from an animal that's healthy.\n\n \r\n\r\nI get it from- Kathy gets it for me.\n\n We have some people who slaughter buffalo for us.\n\n We get all the glands, and we ask them to give us 70 pounds of bowels with all the contents in it, by the way I need to get some more.\n\n About a couple of pounds of bowel with fecal man, give it all away.\n\n \r\n\r\nPardon.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, probably because of the vagotomy, I had less digestive acids, so sometimes I'd eat a high amount of fat I'd have very loose stools, diarrhea or loose stools?\n\n That's an indication that I'm not digesting all of it and if I eat the fecal matter, I can digest a lot more.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nI ate some of the fecal matter yesterday, buffaloes, and I had two bowel movements today.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, ot of people who have constipation, that relieves it, and if it's the other way around, diarrhea, it helps reverse it the other way.\n\n \r\n\r\nEating shit is good, not very tasty.\n\n I hate cooked vegetables.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (33) Raw Coconut Cream & Butter \n \nNo, even though it says raw, I demanded that they give me a letter from the producer\n\n The producer told me that coconut butter, even though they call it raw and unheated in the, they pre-heat it before they juice it because it spoils so quickly from set 170 to 200 degrees.\n\n So, he said, I cannot guarantee that it's under 200.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then one of the latest it's on raw food, I mean it's called nature's first law, their website, they advertise a completely raw coconut butter or coconut oil and I got a letter from Dave Wolf saying that it was completely raw.\n\n It was not even above 105-106 degrees.\n\n Finally, I found the producer in Indonesia, and he says, it goes up to at least 118-120.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (34) Regeneration Of Brain Tissue \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about regeneration of brain tissue, do you believe it's possible\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n As I said in my book, it certainly did it for my son, it certainly did it for me.\n\n I was autistic.\n\n I was autistic from all the vaccines from the thimerosal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you've got dead brain cells that's not permanent.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, it's never permanent, but mine wasn't advancing as much- mine got to a certain point I probably reversed about 20% of the scarring in my brain in the first 6 years I was on the diet and then it just stopped completely?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Root Herb Juice \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat particular root herb\n\n \r\nIt's high in carbs, the problem with those juices is if you don't get them raw is any herb that you get any root that you get that's dried?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIt's not dried, this is fresh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFresh, then it would probably be okay in very small amounts medicinally.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow would I take it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, they say that it increases brain activity and balance and nervous system?\n\n \r\nWell, you don't want much, any root is very, very concentrated, like ginseng.\n\n You know, maybe about 10 drops.\n\n There are 30 drops to a teaspoon.\n\n So, you're looking at a third of a teaspoon if you're going to have something like that.\n\n \r\nI find it's easier to grate a root like ginger, if you just want ginger and you want, let's say a teaspoon because it's very concentrated, it can burn you.\n\n So, let's say I'm making a throat lozenge.\n\n I'll take a raw butter and honey, about two thirds butter, one-third honey and I like ginger in it if I have a sore throat.\n\n I'll take the ginger and grate it and squeeze it in my finger and get the drops out or take it between two pieces of marble or glass and press it either way and get more out of them.\n\n \r\nOf course, you've got to press it between glass and marble, then you will squeeze it with your fingers.\n\n Yeah, grate it.\n\n \r\nThen you don't have to pull your juicer out just to juice a little bit.\n\n \r\nYes, squeeze some juice out of it and put it with another juice.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nPut it with your green juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, put it in your green juice?\n\n \r\nYeah, just one before you're ready to drink it.\n\n One, serving, one 10 drop portion.\n\n  \r\nI found that if you're playing with very potent herbs that people who overdo it really have some side effects and it usually creeps up and gets them all at one time and it's, it's quite a chore to bring them out of it because it's more psychological, it affects the nervous system.\n\n Causes people to get very anxiety stricken or panicked.\n\n  \r\nProbably one part of that is that all herbs, roots, bark, all of that contains high levels of heavy metals.\n\n It's a natural part of the earth.\n\n Water comes down, dissolves, rock, other creatures eat it.\n\n Dissolution, worms, the plants that eat that the bacteria can dissolve the rock and absorb it into its tissue.\n\n And then if we take it and juice it, we get those heavy metals too, as long as they're fresh and organic and not dried or heated in any way or steeped or even sun steeped, we won't have an ill reaction from those heavy metals.\n\n They will not become free radicals in the body.\n\n Once you dehydrate that substance, and you try to reconstitute it the enzymatic ionic electrolyte action coupled with those metals are gone.\n\n They are not connected anymore.\n\n It's like taking our sun and getting rid of the planets.\n\n There's nothing to hold it in place, it'll just shoot around like a proton.\n\n Our planets hold the sun in place.\n\n That's the proton, the planets are the neurons.\n\n \r\nYou eliminate those and that proton goes shooting around and just like an atomic bomb that will split other solar systems, just like we'll do to cells in the body.\n\n Free radicals are not a good thing.\n\n There's mercury, there's strychnine.\n\n There's all kinds of trace toxic metals if they're not ionic and electrolyte bound enzymatically utilized in food.\n\n \r\nAnybody who takes a mineral supplement you're poisoning your body.\n\n A lot of people feel good from it and from herbs, because what it does is, just like they used to use an formaldehyde and strychnine in the past as remedies.\n\n You went to a doctor, and they poisoned you purposely just like they do with cancer nowadays, what that does is it poisons in the blood, the body has to deal with just taking care of those blood poisons and all detoxification stops.\n\n That means if you have swelling somewhere that was causing pain, that swelling would reduce and stop, and that pain would usually go away because the body cannot tend to that damaged area anymore.\n\n So, you had caused yourself more toxicity that will usually end up in that area while it shuts down the cleansing process.\n\n Plus, your whole body is a little bit sicker, so you're not improving your health, you're just stopping the symptoms.\n\n I would say a less harmful way of stopping the toxicity.\n\n slowing it down is eating two, three ounces of cooked chicken.\n\n That would be a favorable way because there's less toxicity that way than steeping and boiling herbs.\n\n \r\nYeah, but also there's a lot of people that believe in herbs still, even if they're on a raw diet a lot of people still take herbs and take vitamin supplements, which are all very toxic.\n\n \r\nWell, it causes a toxicity in the blood, just like any kind of toxicity does.\n\n So, the body stops the detox, the general intense detox that's going on.\n\n I'm saying, if you can't handle the detox, if it's gone on too long and you're about to kill your girlfriend or your boyfriend or something like that.\n\n Or you're going to kill yourself, then do something about it, do something differently.\n\n I've first suggesting you use the nut formula with some meat and if that doesn't work, then kill somebody first and then eat some cooked chicken and that will help.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Sensitive Teeth \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid you hear her question\n\n When she went on the diet, her teeth were so sensitive that he was sensitive to cold drinks, anything?\n\n Severe pain and sensitivity in the teeth.\n\n She's a cosmetologist she'd been around hair spray.\n\n Heavy metals.\n\n Also the aerosol contamination.\n\n It went into your brain.\n\n A lot of it goes into the brain, because your inhaling it.\n\n Goes into the brain and it comes out the teeth, damages the nerves.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Silverware \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nI've been wondering about metal silverware; some people have like silver spoons or whatever you shouldn't even those\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNever real silverware, stainless steel is okay?\n\n I don't like the taste of it, so I use wood mostly, or my fingers, hand.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDon't use this kind of a spoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm not saying don't?\n\n I'm just saying if you don't like the taste of metal use wood- wooden spoon, It's up to you, but if you're using silverware, real silver, there's mercury, there's lead.\n\n There's all kinds of toxicity that- you know how silverware tarnishes that's a mold.\n\n Flakes off into your food.\n\n I don't care what stage it is.\n\n Even if you can't see it and you just polished them.\n\n That's a chemical, so a solvent gets into your food.\n\n Stainless steel is fine.\n\n Brass is again, highly mold reactive.\n\n \r\nWell gold plated is okay, gold doesn't mold.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Solvents \n \nWell, there are many solvents, many processes that can do it\n\n If you take coconut cream, which is best solvent that I've seen for metals.\n\n What causes them to be cohesive, it'll go in there and just all of a sudden melt it, and then the molecules are separating sparse.\n\n So, then your fat molecules, your fat cells, where your white blood cells can go in and bind with them and send them out of the body.\n\n \r\nYou know what a zit is.\n\n A zit is a bunch of white cells, fatty cells, that chelates with toxins, and they're passing them out through the pore?\n\n You may have 5 billion white cells pussing out of a spot that is only five or six molecules of something that is very dangerous, even to take cocaine and snort cocaine.\n\n If they go on a good diet, you can better believe that if they have any lymph problems at all they're going to be putting out postulation all over everywhere because it takes 30 to 40 molecules of fat to bind new one molecule of cocaine to get it out of the body.\n\n \r\nYou may try to throw it out the kidneys or blood stream with congested lymph.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Spinal Pain \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, I'm not sure if it's an accident-related situation, but I have pain in these fingers\n\n I'm an accident lawyer, so I can through the cause and effects.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, but these two fingers and also my right leg.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNerve damage can come from so many things, you know, let's say you can have a center in the brain that's like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's you have a definite area in the brain that would be connected to those two fingers and your leg, right leg.\n\n Those two fingers could be in your spine.\n\n \r\nYou know, something pinched or blocked up in the one up here that leads down to those two fingers and also the one down here leads to the knee.\n\n So, if you have pain in the spine that relates- if it's the fingers it's up in here and if you have any pain or stiffness, you know, it's probably their problem.\n\n \r\nIf you don't have any pain or discomfort in those areas, you probably have brain or it's local and from a sprain or, you know, break or something like that or torn ligament.\n\n But that will also mean some pain in that area along with the numbness, some aching, some strain, especially if you sleep on it, when the circulation's cut off, he goes into pain.\n\n \r\nSo, if you don't have that, it's the brain.\n\n If you don't have either of those it's in the brain.\n\n You have some neurological tissue that's probably dead.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nInjured or just a toxic condition.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it could be either way, in an injured when you have mercury from a vaccine or a flu shot or anything like that, they all carry thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, and that'll cause that repeatedly?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Teeth & Dentists \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, you're talking about a subject that takes many, many years to\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\nThe question is how do you get a *dentist* to do what is compatible with the diet.\n\n There is nothing compatible with about anything a dentist does, anytime they put anything in your mouth, they have to put an epoxy in there.\n\n Just like you have veins going throughout the body.\n\n \r\nYou have tubules in the teeth, which take circulation and nutrients from the nerve into the tooth, and it passes into the mouth.\n\n When your teeth are decaying, they're not decaying from the outside, they're decaying from the poisoning out from in the mouth, in the nerves, passing out.\n\n Weakens the dentine.\n\n Yes bacteria can eat away at the outside if the dentine is fouled by the poisons that are on the inside going out, but people who have strong teeth and strong bloodstreams, do not get cavities like the Eskimos.\n\n They eat 90% of their diet was raw meat and only 10% that wasn't was that 10% was out of the three months of the year where they could get berries and other things and they had no cavities until 1886 and that was first cavity was the fellow who's eating the breads and sugar that the Germans have brought over for 50 years was the first cavity.\n\n Anytime you put anything in the mouth and fill it, it has to be a epoxied in.\n\n Therefore, you're going to contaminate the tooth more.\n\n \r\nWhat I've done is when my cavities pop, I leave them alone.\n\n I don't put anything back, but that means, you know, some of them are almost all filling.\n\n So, those teeth, I've had three of them break because there was hardly any tooth in it.\n\n So, I have a tooth that I had them make in Mexico because they will not do this here.\n\n \r\nThey are not allowed to give you a tooth that you can remove.\n\n They have to cement it in and I don't want it cemented in cause I don't want that to epoxy in my mouth because I'm experimenting to see whether teeth can regenerate on this diet and I won't know for another 20 years, but I'm taking a chance, I'm taking a chance on losing my teeth.\n\n I've got another one here that's made the same way because the tooth broke.\n\n I mean, those teeth- the one back here, this molar, two-thirds of the tooth had been a filling and when it popped out, I let them go until there was no more decay, I had a dentist look at it every year, no decay for those 8 years.\n\n And I left the filling out of it and it didn't break until I was ripping on some gristle and it broke, but that's what it took.\n\n I mean, cavities, I don't have any more cavities.\n\n All these open cavities, teeth that are wide open, nerves that are wide open, no pain, no decay.\n\n I've got wide open fillings.\n\n \r\nBecause you have poisons that come out through the gums constantly, especially your milk because milk can carry toxic substances and metals from the brain and the brain holds the most toxic metals in the entire body and it comes out in the gums and that can be a solvent reaction that dissolves dentine.\n\n So, you definitely want to brush.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDental cleaning.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I don't like that?\n\n Every time I go there it causes my gums to recede more and they're telling me your gums are receding.\n\n Well, every animal's gums recede throughout their whole life and there's not a problem with it.\n\n They just make a lot of money on the cleanings and rip the shit out of the gums.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYellow teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you have to realize again the contamination is coming through the tubules out to the tooth?\n\n Take people who snort cocaine.\n\n You see their teeth that turn gray.\n\n That's because all that cocaine has gone down, gotten into the nerves and is leaking into the nerves out the teeth and it turns your teeth gray?\n\n \r\nOh, no, I've seen a reverse after maybe 12 years on the diet, people who had cocaine.\n\n \r\nYeah, but I was hoping for that, but I probably had so much chemo radiation, and so much mercury in my days from all the vaccines that I had, especially tetanus.\n\n I hadn't been able to regenerate, and I got one kid, he was 22 years old, he had a huge cavity pop out, in a year it was completely filled in, you know.\n\n I'm not like that.\n\n \r\nI'm too toxic.\n\n You know, that would be wonderful.\n\n \r\nYeah, I remember one girl who had cancer and was vomiting a lot and her saliva was fouler than the oldest high meat that I've ever smelled.\n\n It was worse than the Eskimo stuff that they buried, and she had to spit it out.\n\n If she swallowed it, she would've been vomiting more \r\nWhen she did swallow it, she did swallow more.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat do you brush with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI usually brush it with cream or butter and milk?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nNot mixed with the clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can, if you would like to Polish your teeth and help get rid of some heavier plaques, if you have it deep down in your gums, mixing a little powdered clay like the Aztec secret clay with the butter or cream and that'll act as a jeweler's rouge and polish them?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Thyroid \n \n \n \n \n### (42) Tomatoes Hydration \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI will do that with tomatoes too\n\n Probably three weeks ago I couldn't eat enough tomatoes.\n\n Probably the vitamin A, it's also a good way to get rid of dehydration, biggest way to eliminate dehydration.\n\n Celery juice, tomatoes are the best.\n\n Non high fruit concentrations of sodium.\n\n  \r\nSometimes when the body is utilizing fat it starts to dehydrate when detoxing old toxic fats because it has to pull in extra fluids and I don't like to drink water because it's leaching and it's very non-nutritive, so I like to use something with enzymes and electrolytes in it.\n\n So, I use tomatoes or vegetable juice to correct that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nCan you juice some tomatoes with the vegetables.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I would eat the tomatoes?\n\n You don't have to have them together; I'm just saying those two forms are good ways to take care of dehydration.\n\n Your body can digest much of the fiber in the tomato skin/peel, but there's a lot of vitamin D and A in the skin itself and if I only digest a third of it, it's a lot.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Toxic Farts \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs it toxic to smell your own farts\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nThat's the first time I've ever heard that question! \r\nQuestion is, is it toxic to smell your own farts?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nAny gas that's produced from toxicity will be toxic even if it's your own.\n\n \r\nWell, high meat may cause a breakdown of toxic substances in your body that creates a toxic gas.\n\n So, it's still gonna be toxic if you can get to a window or don't eat cooked foods, and then you have to worry about.\n\n \r\nUnless you're eating too much green and too many berries and it can cause farts and then it's usually a metallic fart.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Toxins From Shooting Guns \n \n \n \n \n### (45) Vegan \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, when you're a vegan you're eating lots of whole vegetables and that destroys your enzymes in your system\n\n The bowels are normally acidic, in a vegetarian they're over alkaline.\n\n So, most of the bacteria is destroyed, that's why they usually have no bowel movements unless they're eating high fiber and if they stop eating high fiber and go on this diet, they usually have constipation quite a while.\n\n So, it depends upon the number of years that they've been vegetarian, but they will reduce their ability to digest more and more foods every year.\n\n \r\nYou're not going to get a vegetarian to eat cow shit.\n\n \r\nYeah, it would help, definitely help.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n To restore it.\n\n A lot of you laughing, but every animal eats shit, except humans.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Weight Gain \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYour leg, your back or where\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do to heal or strengthen that knee?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot that you'd be happy about?\n\n Tony is a model.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have to get fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, that's the only way you can heal those parts quickly is to gain a lot of weight?\n\n It's like- is Frank here.\n\n Okay, Frank?\n\n He finally got up to a very heavyweight and he says, oh my God, I know what you're talking about.\n\n He said, I feel so grounded and so good now and that's the truth.\n\n When you gain plenty of fat, fat and happy is a reality because yeah, I said, you know, why.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat if you're 300 pounds.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends on- I mean, if you're a wrestler, you're keeping active with all that weight, maybe it'll work for you, and it can be very good?\n\n So, it depends upon the individual.\n\n I had one client who was 5' 2.\n\n5'' and she said, she's not short, she's just scaled down and she got up to 160 one time and that was pretty big.\n\n It's bigger than anybody in this room, close to your size and she felt so grounded and so happy, and it wasn't a problem for her, and she had more health progress in that six months that she stayed that way than I'd ever seen her go through.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it's an individual thing and I've got enough.\n\n I gained as much as 60 pounds.\n\n When I was very thin, I gained 60 pounds, all that cream.\n\n I was eating a quart of cream a day, plus a brick of cheese a day.\n\n I was putting it on, I gained 60 pounds in like four months, five months and I felt wonderful, and all these girls were attracted to me.\n\n It was incredible and I could take care of them all too.\n\n I had five girls at one time.\n\n I had all this energy and power, it was great, and they all showed up at my door at the same time, within a half an hour of each other and guess what I did, I went to a motel and let them stay together for the night.\n\n I was very honest, I let them all know I was going with all of them.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they had a good party.\n\n They had a great time.\n\n They all got along, and I had a good time with those girls.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, being overweight and being not beautiful.\n\n It's usually not a problem, it's the psychology of getting big.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (47) Weight Gain 2 \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n⁠What should I be doing with your diet\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you need to put on some good fat first.\n\n The whole diet plan, if you're asking for something like that you need to make an appointment with them.\n\n \r\n\r\nUsually when you're that overweight you will lose weight on the diet, come to a point, gain some for a little bit and then start taking it off.\n\n And then usually after about 4 years you never have to get that big again.\n\n I allow women to go.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n don't allow.\n\n I like women to gain at least 12 pounds over their normal weight.\n\n \r\n\r\nMen, I ask them to do 15 to 30.\n\n I'd ask women to do that, but they're too vain.\n\n And they're a lot healthier once you gain that excess weight, just like Frank.\n\n We finally reached that high point, he says, God I know you're talking about it's so good.\n\n Big difference.\n\n When it's the raw fat.\n\n How long has Frank been on it now.\n\n**[Darlene]**\n \r\n\r\n1 year and 8 months?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNow I remember when Frank called, Darlene was in the background.\n\n He said, \"I think about going on your diet and my wife thinks you're out of your mind\".\n\n Darlene's in the back, \"Don't do that diet, what are you crazy.\n\n You're gonna get really sick!\"?\n\n \r\n\r\nI hear her doing this whole thing in the back and Frank's trying to have a conversation with me.\n\n**[Darlene]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's when I weighed 105.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, so she's calmer and happier and she's on the diet too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nThe weight gain you're talking about.\n\n Is it distributed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, his is very nicely distributed and usually in women it may- if you have a lot of?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n women because of the high hormone content around this area, they store lots of they're toxins.\n\n They have more fat to bind a little more toxins and if it's a bad cholesterol it'll store in certain areas, and it's usually around in here where they're generating a lot of hormones to bind with the poison, because especially if they were on a fat free diet or limit their fats.\n\n They're going to use hormones to chelate with poisons instead of normal fats, blood fats.\n\n So, they store in these areas, cause cellulite and it'll dry up and get harder and just keep going through the body, build onto it and then when you have to go and dissolve it, you dissolve a little layer at a time.\n\n So, it causes swelling temporarily until you have it pumping out for 2.\n\n5 to 3 years like I say in the book, unless you've had a C-Section, then it could last 8-10 years.\n\n \r\n\r\nif you don't have enough blood fat, that's why I like people to gain weight during that period, so that they'll chelate with them, so they won't have a problem with them and get rid of them.\n\n Otherwise, we're just going to stir them up in the blood, get them panicky, upset, depressed, angry, and it goes right back into this tissue again, into the organs usually.\n\n \r\n\r\nPulls it out of here and put them into wherever there's fat in, and if the fats in the glands that's where it'll go.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt can, because if your body wants to use those hormones to help you burn.\n\n Yeah, get rid of it.\n\n Definitely will.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (48) White Teeth \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMore butter and that makes a great dental\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd that'll make your teeth whiter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI doubt it?\n\n Again, whiteness comes from the toxicity coming from the brain or the mandible going into the nerves.\n\n So, over the years as you clean out those nerves, then you have nerves and tubules that go into the tooth without fillings, then of course their circulation over the compound in the tooth to make it white.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, no it won't \r\nNope.\n\n They all contain mercury.\n\n \r\nThey say tell your children not to swallow it.\n\n A warning notice on it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey don't say mercury on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCause it's a trace amount, they don't have to say, unless it's a certain amount?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about hydrogen peroxide.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFor the teeth?\n\n Well, you burn your gums, it damages cells, and you said it burns, but you put it on your skin and cause a white spot cause it burned the cells?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about drinking hydrogen peroxide.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot a good idea?\n\n I said in my book certain people could use maybe five drops of hydrogen peroxide in a certain solution, but that was just certain people.\n\n \r\nI haven't seen any of those.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\nI spent a whole time talking about it, so if you missed it.\n\n You need to talk to somebody else.\n\n Clay, butter and cream.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about mouthwash.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLemon or lime is great for a mouthwash?\n\n Yeah, just squeeze it in and mix it around and spit it out with some bubbly water.\n\n \r\nAnd then mix it with some like Gerolsteiner or Perrier.\n\n \r\nThat really won't cleanse the toxicity out of the mouth, but it'll help with the smell of the mouth.\n\n \r\nThe parsley e helps break- like I said in my book, parsley juice helps break down bacteria in the mouth, and then you can use ginger, all those things will help bad breath.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

I can be questioned?\n\n! I made Wall Street Journal, a financial magazine, why did they put me on the cover?\n\n Because they had an article about raw milk?\n\n This was on Wednesday, title of the article was \"Got Raw Milk\", and they put me as the leader of the underground.\n\n \r\nI didn't even get out to try to find the paper until like five o'clock in the evening and I had to go to five places because they were sold out to get it, but I found one place that had fine copies.\n\n That's not my website.\n\n That's my publisher's website from the books.\n\n I don't have time.\n\n \r\nUm, but I have a copy here.\n\n I'll pass it around.\n\n If everybody wants to afterwards, \r\nJames Stewart, read it to me.\n\n Maybe I'll read it to all of you.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bath Formula \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTwo to three cups of milk\r\nTwo ounces of raw-unpasteurized apple cider vinegar\r\nTwo level tablespoons of sun dried sea salt\r\n\r\nIt's in the Recipe Book\r\n\n\r\nCan you add clay\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can if you like, maybe a little bit more drying for your skin, but that's okay?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Best To Have Parasites, Bacteria, Than Virus \n \nIt's a slow, nasty, long process\n\n It's like, let's say you had a bunch of dogs or cats eat up this dead carcass.\n\n Your extra meat that was running around, you had leftovers, or you could get some kind of acid to dissolve it, right.\n\n And then you'd have all of this waste product and this massive amount of fluid?\n\n\r\nThat's how virus work in the body.\n\n It's better to have parasites, best to have parasites.\n\n Second best to have bacteria.\n\n Virus if you have to.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Bland Fruit With Meat \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nTomatoes is not a high carbohydrate fruit, it's a bland fruit, highly acid\n\n Cucumbers are a little too high in the alkalinizing minerals, but it's not high in high carbohydrates, so it's still okay.\n\n You just don't want to eat too much with meat.\n\n \r\nThe tomatoes are higher in acids.\n\n You can eat much as you like with the meat.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nNo more than 3 cucumber slices.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, about 3 slices?\n\n I said two tablespoons in the recipes book.\n\n I said two tablespoons of anything high alkalinizing.\n\n That goes for parsley, cucumbers, zucchini, whatever it is that's highly alkaline.\n\n \r\nYou want to keep it to two tablespoons per cup of meat.\n\n \r\nA cup of meat is only a third of a cup, eggs are acid.\n\n You can have as many eggs as you want with meat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Bring Food For 12-24 Hour \n \n \n \n \n### (9) Cant Mix Vege Juice WIth Animal Products \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nWe cannot mix green vegetable juice with any other animal product except for cream or butter or coconut cream\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Citrus Oil Use Brake Fluid As Solvent \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\n\r\nRemember any time you take any kind of citrus oil they use a solvent that's like brake fluid to dissolve that, once you treat it that way, it is a highly reactive toxin\n\n I don't care where it came from.\n\n They use turpentine, you know turpentine is made from oils that are extracted like that from pine needles, and also they have paint thinners that are made from orange peels, all the orange oil in it.\n\n And once they treat it that way, it is a highly active toxin.\n\n These companies love to tote it as natural because then they get you to buy their product, but it has nothing to do with natural.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (11) Clay Recommendations \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\nWell, I'm still investigating\n\n Right now, I'm using the French green clay and that's good clay.\n\n The Terramin clay, T E R R A M I N, is a pretty good clay.\n\n It's from the desert, the California desert.\n\n Some of the areas where they mined it was from a thermal bed that was about the active maybe 900 years ago or so.\n\n \r\nSo, some of those minerals are still cauterized, I'm experimenting with some of it, eating some of it just to see what's like.\n\n Cause it may have had enough bacterial activity to where that cauterization has reversed itself, but I'm not going to say positively it is.\n\n But you can use it as a mask, you can use it in the bath, you use it as a skin application, whatever you like.\n\n \r\nNo, you have to get it off the internet.\n\n No, Terramin.\n\n Green clay, you can get it at any of the health food stores in the bulk department.\n\n \r\nYeah, it's a dry clay.\n\n Then you mix it in and make a paste of it.\n\n \r\nIf I'm putting some clay in the juice, bind with some poisons in the juice.\n\n I would blend the foam with the honey, then the honey I'll put the clay in that and when that's all mixed in, I pour it into the rest of the juice and stir that.\n\n \r\nDoesn't make any difference, in that bath it doesn't make any difference.\n\n When you put the vinegar in it, that adds an acidity, almost all of the minerals that are sold are on the alkaline side.\n\n That's why make I put the vinegar in there to make sure everybody's getting a good balance.\n\n We're not getting over alkalinized.\n\n The skin is natural acid, so you want it acid, but you don't want it acid from the 192 chemicals in the water.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cold Milk \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nAre you drinking it cold or warm\n\n \r\n\r\nI rest my case, whenever you drink cold milk, what happens?\n\n Your stomach shrinks, contracts?\n\n When your stomach is contracted you can't build and secrete hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, what happens.\n\n You have unprocessed sugars and unprocessed proteins move into the duodenum?\n\n They go right into the blood undigested.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen the liver has to try to handle the situation or the pancreas and that'll cause some cramping, let's say the time before you drank it cold, but you didn't have the reaction right away until the next time you drank the milk.\n\n All of a sudden, the body's doing to deal with that undigested protein that's sitting in the liver.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I tell people not to drink cold.\n\n Don't do it.\n\n \r\n\r\nMinimum, I would say is you take it out right away and you put it in a bowl of warm water, and it gets to body temperature probably a half hour.\n\n But, if you just take it out and don't put it in warm water and you let it sit in the cupboard, put it in a dark cupboard because the light will turn it bitter.\n\n In the dark cupboard, let it sit 8, 10 hours.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, it just isn't as tasty, can also make some bad breath.\n\n \r\n\r\nCertain bacteria the reaction with gums, dental bone and dental nerves and causes it to detox heavily.\n\n That's why it creates a bad breath.\n\n It's not a bad breath, normally like the toxins getting into the blood, the gasses from the stomach given the air passage and secreted out the longs, that's one kind of bad breath.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe particular bad breath from bitter milk.\n\n It's usually breaking down the toxicity in the nerve tissue or the bones in the mandible and it secretes out the gum along the teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, is 60-70 degrees okay or does it have to be up to body temperature.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, it depends?\n\n If you let it sit for 8, 10 hours at room temperature, 60, 70 degrees.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe cooler it is the warmer.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (13) Cooked Foods Leaches Enzymes \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause the liver doesn't have to leach enzymes, the pancreas doesn't have to leach enzymes\n\n People are eating cooked foods and mixing, they have so many varieties of foods that need these various enzymes and they have to leach them all from the body.\n\n So, if they can leach to just one kind, that that means they only have to build several kinds of enzymes to go out and leach.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf they've got a whole mixture of foods, they have to have 100 varieties of these hormones that'll go out and pull-out missing enzymes.\n\n So again, it's with cooked foods there's a problem, not with raw.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (14) Detox Pathways & Hot Baths Help With Pain \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBecause the minerals are magnetic, and they're concentrated\n\n So, you have poisons in your skin and your lymph system throws more poisons off through the skin than anywhere else in the system.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nCan you repeat that again with the lymph system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou've heard that one a dozen times.\n\n The lymph system throws off more toxins than any other part of the body.\n\n \r\nIt throws toxins off into the tear ducts, into the gums, the tongue, the salivary glands, the earwax, the mucus, all throughout the body, the urinary tract, females with their uterus, all that mucus dumps poisons, builds a lot of mineral poisons into the nails and hair.\n\n Every part of the body is a bowel because we're so toxic, all complete assholes.\n\n Literally.\n\n  \r\nSo, the skin is the largest area, mass areas that secretes these poisons as you perspire.\n\n So, getting into a hot mineral bath is a good thing, that's why I used to live in the bathtub, with my milk and my vinegar and my sea salt when I was so in pain from blood and bone cancer, every joint in my body ached.\n\n I couldn't lie on any side of my body for more than 10 minutes.\n\n I'd fall asleep, wake up severe pain after 10 minutes, so I could never get any sleep.\n\n  \r\nSo, I would put \r\n2-3 cups of milk in the bath,  \r\n\r\nTwo ounces of raw unpasteurized vinegar \r\n\r\nTwo level tablespoons of sundried sea salt \r\n\r\n\r\nI could just lie in there, and what it would do is all of the pain, that's an electrical charge that gets up to the brain where it all registers.\n\n \r\nWell, for some reason in the water, it discharges it into the water.\n\n All that pain goes into the water, instead of in my brain, so I didn't have to experience it, so I was able to sleep.\n\n I wake up every hour and a half to two hours freezing to death and I would just let some of the water out, put some more hot water in without having to add any more nutrients to the water and I can sleep in that water 6 to 12 hours and that's the only way I was able to heal because that's the only way to sleep.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Factory Farmed Meat Antibitoics & Hormones \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nWell, yes\n\n Your regular feed cows are fed lots of antibiotics, shot with antibiotics, have clips with antibiotics on their ears, lots of hormones, growth hormones in the sheep, so they'll grow faster and be larger and they get a lot of soy byproducts and there are two poisons that have been known to be highly carcinogenic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Food Poisoning & Rotten Meat \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI'm fairly new to this and of course, one of the hardest ones to get over was eating chicken\n\n And I ate chicken, but, and I'd eaten it a few times, but then one time I ate it and smelled it and everything, but I got really sick.\n\n Like diarrhea for a week, 103 fever for two days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat doesn't mean you got it from the chicken.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLike, how do you know if you actually did get food poisoning or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's no such thing as food poisoning, unless you're eating cooked food?\n\n Just remember that when a bacteria feeds on cooked food, it's eating poisons along with it.\n\n It's like if eat cooked food and get heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides and advanced glycation end products and acrylamides.\n\n Those are the major toxins.\n\n We also have other complex auctions, which are not as investigated, but I mentioned them in the recipe book.\n\n So, when the bacteria feed on them too, they also produce more toxins.\n\n So, their Vera toxins will be 10 to a 100x more toxic and when they're raw, they're never toxic.\n\n \r\nAs I said in the recipe book, the people who aren't on this diet have an average of 18 to 20% diarrhea and vomiting happening all the time.\n\n 18 to 20% of the population, on this diet say 12%, depending on the time of year.\n\n So, there's a lot less diarrhea and vomiting, but you can't associate either with raw or cooked diets because it happens on both.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to say what's causing the diarrhea.\n\n When I've had diarrhea, analyzed and vomit analyzed, I found a lot of poisons.\n\n A lot of dead liver cells, gallbladder, spleen, something like that in the vomit.\n\n In the diarrhea, I found a lot of dead bowel cells or intestinal cells or liver cells or muscular cells, and some gut cells.\n\n \r\nSo, it's a dumping area of the stomach and the bowel and the intestines are a dumping area for these poisons to leave the blood, to get in and out of the body.\n\n So, vomiting and diarrhea is a good thing whether you're on a cooked diet or raw diet, and it has nothing to do with what you're eating.\n\n \r\nHowever, if you're eating cooked food, you're more likely to create more of it because you're putting more poisons to be dumped into the stomach and intestines.\n\n \r\nSo, you've got to get out of this stigma that some raw food has caused you to have diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n If you had diarrhea and vomiting when you're eating cooked foods, what would you blame it on.\n\n It's all these poisons in the body?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nI didn't get sick eating it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs that because you're used to eating it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it smelled pretty good to me?\n\n People who've eaten it a lot, it starts smelling good to them.\n\n It's like the Eskimos, first time I smelled it, I couldn't get within five feet- I was like the camera man, I wanted to vomit like crazy, and the children were jumping up and down for this odor.\n\n They love it because it gets them so high and happy, makes them strong for the winter, the fall and winter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Gay People Drugs, HIV and Cirrhosis \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nExactly! It's the last-ditch savior for the liver\n\n \r\nBecause they use so many chemical drugs that damage the liver, that's why the war department used aids on them.\n\n Aids was created in the laboratories of UCLA in 61 and 62.\n\n They were creating it to create cancer in animals, so they could study cancer.\n\n That information was given to the war department.\n\n \r\nAll of a sudden in the late sixties and seventies, it started turning up mainly in the gay community, 90% in the gay community because the gay community was using poppers, which is amyl nitrate to bring you out of a seizure if you go into a heart attack, They were using speed, methadone, all kinds of drugs, damaging their livers terribly.\n\n \r\nSo, they'd get severe hepatitis because they got so much degenerative tissue in their livers, they'd have to acquire some kind of radical detoxification to save the liver and the hepatitis was it.\n\n So, they infected the hepatitis B vaccine that was given to 90% homosexuals.\n\n Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York city documented by Stryker, and I mentioned the book in my first book, called the \"Bio-Attack Alert\".\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Germ Theory Groups Of People Getting Sick \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo similar illness\n\n Now, if the drug theory doesn't apply, how does it apply coincidentally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's not coincidentally, let's say that food had been like the Jack In The Box incident, they didn't clean out at the factory when they were grinding the meat?\n\n They did not clean out benzene out of the grinders properly.\n\n So, when the meat got through that whole 225-pound block of ground beef was affected with that benzene.\n\n Who are they going to blame it on though.\n\n What happens when you put poisons in the body, create bacteria to eat the degenerative tissue?\n\n So, of course you're always going to find salmonella or E.\n\n coli or campylobacter in the presence of degenerative tissue.\n\n \r\nSo, instead of saying the benzene created the damage to the cells, it caused the reaction from the body to use bacteria to break down that tissue, they point right to the bacteria as the cause.\n\n It's not the cause, it's the chemical that's the cause.\n\n If it was a bacteria, man would have gone to become extinct a long time ago.\n\n \r\nWe haven't had refrigeration for about a hundred years.\n\n I mean, I remember when I was still a kid, they were bringing blocks of ice in the farm.\n\n So, bacteria has been with us a long time and like I said in my milk report.\n\n They used to feed babies in the hospitals who were highly contaminated and diseased milk that was 300 million parts pathogens.\n\n 300 million parts, they only allow 10 of them into milk now.\n\n 10 parts they allow, and they were feeding infants who were getting well who had some kind of disease they were feeding them 300 million parts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen was this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbout 60-70 years ago?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Goats Vs Cows Milk \n \n**[2003],[Lewis]**\n \r\n\n \r\nGoats milk vs cow's milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay, let me go through it.\n\n Goat's milk is high in hormones, especially adrenaline.\n\n So, people who are thin and hyperactive should not be drinking goat's milk.\n\n They should be drinking cow's milk, settle their nervous system.\n\n Those people who are overweight could use the adrenaline.\n\n \r\nSo, goat's milk is fine for them, people in-between.\n\n If you feel hyperactive, anxious, irritable, don't drink goat's milk cows, drink cow's milk.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDoes this apply to goats' cream too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nGoats' cream still contains a lot of precursors for developing adrenal hormone?\n\n Goats cream is not going to relax your system, cows' cream is.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nStay away from goats' milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you're anxious and irritable, then just stick with cows?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Goverment Doing Bio Warfare \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAlways we're subjected to some kind of chemical contamination, and I don't know if you've done any investigation of that\n\n The US military has been using- one time they dropped it on 1 million people in the little swamps of Louisiana, chemical testing, biological warfare on our own people in Louisiana, 1 million people.\n\n \r\nBiological chemical warfare on our own people documented.\n\n They do the chemtrails.\n\n \r\nEverybody's detoxing.\n\n Disease is always detoxification, pain is always detoxification, pain is swelling in the area.\n\n Swelling is always an increase of nutrients to the area, trying to get more nutrients in there to clean the area, to cleanse the area, to detoxify and to supply nutrients for healing.\n\n Colds, flus, no matter what it is, it's all detoxification.\n\n \r\nThis diet doesn't change anything, except that when you detoxify, you detoxify properly, and you heal properly.\n\n People who are cooked foods do not detoxify properly and do not heal properly.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Grocery Store Meat Vs New Zealand \n \n**[2003],[Roger]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIs there a great difference between the meat that you find in ordinary grocery stores compared to what you buy at whole foods from New Zealand\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBig, huge difference?\n\n New Zealand is almost all raised meat.\n\n Plus, it's mostly organic, and the regular supermarkets, they feed them lots of grain and most of the feed that they feed them are byproducts from food processing.\n\n They take the bran, all the waste products from producing foods for humans, cereals and stuff like that.\n\n All the cooked garbage is what they mix into a meal and give these animals, fattens them up.\n\n \r\nOf course, the body has to produce tremendous amounts of fat to deal with these toxins.\n\n So, the fat is very rich with toxins in your store-bought meat.\n\n Most of them won't be absorbed if you're eating it raw, because it will just pass through, but you're not getting a lot of nutrient value from it as you would from New Zealand beef.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) High Meat Causes Detox \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI don't suggest somebody go out and eat half a pound of high meat if they haven't been on the raw diet for very long\n\n That can cause a massive detox because what is that bacteria going to do.\n\n They're going to go and start eating up all your dead cells and if you have that much waste product dumping at one time it's going to take your full body's energy and you're going to have diarrhea, you're gonna have vomiting?\n\n \r\nSo, you want to be rational about what detoxifications you promote, and that's what I'm going into in the next book.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI've been talking to somebody; she ate 200 pounds of the high meat.\n\n She still been fighting sickness, sick vomiting, and pains in her head.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n200 hundred pounds or 2 pounds.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n200 pounds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n200 pounds of high meat.\n\n That'll 200 days?\n\n**[Attendees],[Kathy]**\n \r\n*Laughing* \r\n\n \r\nI mean, she was raising animals.\n\n I don't know if it was 200 pounds.\n\n I have to make sure.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Kathy]**\n \r\nI'm not sure I believe that story,  \r\n\n \r\nBut I mean, she's still since 1993 in pain and going through vomiting and diarrhea since 1993.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe ate that much in a short period of time.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nShe was raising her own?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWas she eating it raw?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYeah, raw?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSince 1993.\n\n I'd have to question that?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Honey 90% Enzymes \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nEating process honeys and toxic sugars\n\n\r\nSo, unheated honey is not a problem.\n\n There's very little advanced glycation, less than about 10% advanced glycation that comes off of an unheated honey.\n\n When you process honey and heat it, you got 90% going into advanced glycation byproducts.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) How Aids Was Made \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNo, it is no\n\n According to the documentation, it was created by nature, but not the composite of it.\n\n Dr.\n\n Streicher who was trying to discover what aids activity was kept fractionating.\n\n If you fractionate a bacteria cell, there are compounds that they put on it and it fractionates into 5 parts like I'd come apart at my joints.\n\n \r\nI've got six parts, cells like that go into five parts.\n\n That's always the way we react.\n\n These cells were dividing splitting in two, after a thousand he says, wait a minute.\n\n This is man spliced, this is manmade, only man made react like this.\n\n So, I took the two opposite sides, fused them together and found out they had the lymphonomic virus of a cow and the leukemic virus of a sheep.\n\n Those two viruses were put together, that's not natural.\n\n \r\nSo, they spliced it together and that's how he found out who made it because he took the two names of those animal diseases and put them together in 15 different combinations.\n\n He happened to be in Los Angeles at the time, so he went to UCLA, the first name that he picked in combination that it might be called popped right up on the computer at UCLA.\n\n Then his brother who's an attorney tracked it and that's what the book \"Bio attack Alert\" is about.\n\n Documented.\n\n A Wisconsin or Minnesota Senator that helped him get that information from the war department, both of them were dead within three months, suicide and neither of them was suicidal and the likely Kennedy's stuff, but it's happening out there.\n\n There are greedy people and there are people that think that we're all ants and we're not worthy.\n\n They're running the country and they're important because they're running the country and they think that their judgment is the correct judgement.\n\n They are God \r\nCollective toxins create malfunctions, create degenerative tissue, places where disease forms.\n\n The more toxic you get, the more advanced your disease will get.\n\n \r\nIt's not a natural one.\n\n So, it's like a non-natural antibiotic you put into your body.\n\n It's not natural.\n\n It will have degenerative effects on you.\n\n \r\nYes.\n\n I'm saying there is natural disease.\n\n \r\nToxins, yes.\n\n All of them are natural, but if you weren't eating cooked foods, you would never have any kind of toxins and if you weren't exposed to pollution, chemical pollution, industrial pollution, there would be no.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Iridology \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe eye is a readout of the entire physical makeup of the body and there are locations for every gland and organ, particular locations for the autonomically nervous system, bones, skin, lymph system, everything is indicated in the iris and the two irises are different\n\n The outside, the outer half, divide the eye in half, 12 - 6 O'clock.\n\n The outer half of each eye applies to the respective quadrant, outer quadrants of the body and the inner half applies to the opposite inner quadrants of the body, except in some engineers and almost all inventors.\n\n They're same brain ciders, so they don't divide and what I do is I go in there and look to see discolorations, if you have big white areas or big dark areas that shows scarring- scar tissue, possible tumors and discolorations can be plaquing on the outside.\n\n Particular areas where fibers are fractionated, divided, it's like pointless art.\n\n That shows that the poisons are going intracellular rather than extracellular.\n\n So, there's lots of things I look for.\n\n I can do into two hours or five hours on that to get specific.\n\n Basically, I can tell a lot that's going on in the body.\n\n \r\nYour MDs use x-rays.\n\n Basically, if it doesn't hit them in the face, they don't know what is happening in the body.\n\n With iridology I can tell early stages of development of just about anything.\n\n  \r\nWell, most people when they come to see me, they're not happy when they leave because nobody's well.\n\n Most people think they're well, they're not well.\n\n There's damage, there's toxins in your body.\n\n So, if you don't want to know, don't come, but if you know, you know how to get rid of it quicker.\n\n \r\nYes, cardiac arrest.\n\n Yes.\n\n I can see congestion around the heart.\n\n I saw- somebody came a couple of weeks ago, had five little bitty pea size what looks like tumors.\n\n So, I can't say the tumors because I'd be diagnosing, only the medical profession is allowed to.\n\n So, what I say is, this is what I see when people have been diagnosed by the medical profession with tumors and I find them in the heart.\n\n \r\nThree months.\n\n Well, I can see it within a month, but most people can't see until three months have passed.\n\n So, unless somebody's deathly ill, I say come back in a year and that way you can see big changes, and everybody's very happy about those changes, something they can see dramatically.\n\n If you come back in three months, you'll see the subtle changes, that can make you happy.\n\n \r\nBut it's better to come back in a year unless you have cancer or something like that i like to see them every three months.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Is Honey Necessary, Don't Eat On Weight Loss \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYes, very necessary\n\n It's one of the most healing agents because 90% of it is made into enzymes.\n\n Enzymes are very important for digesting and utilizing meat and proteins in the system.\n\n Very important.\n\n Also, it takes care of a lot of the sugar problems that you have, the cravings for sugar is the craving for these enzymes.\n\n\r\nSo, people will go off eating too much fruit, eat too much fruit it's going to turn the entire digestive tract to alkaline.\n\n Meat's going to be repulsive to them.\n\n You're just gonna lose, so eat honey, it's your best way out.\n\n \r\nNot with the weight loss, that'll make you crazy.\n\n Cause then you're searching for too much protein and you're not eating enough protein to utilize that much, honey.\n\n \r\nWell, we found some was 10,000 years old in the pyramid and it was great and fine.\n\n I don't know if there's a limit on it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Lime Juice With Coconut Cream \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\nIf you mix lime juice with the coconut cream right away when you get it home, blend it in there it'll keep for 21 days to 6 weeks\n\n I've got them to last three months.\n\n \r\nWhen you get it home, put it in an eight ounce or four-ounce jars with the lime juice in it.\n\n \r\nI use two tablespoons per 8 ounces.\n\n 2 tablespoons for 4 ounces.\n\n \r\n4 tablespoons per pint.\n\n \r\nBut don't put it in pint jars, put it in 8-ounce jars.\n\n \r\nFermented coconut cream will detox you more.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Medical Industry Blames Nature Tribes Cooked Meat \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYou have to understand the psychology of the medical profession, they're always going to blame some animal for everything\n\n They're always going to blame some bacteria for everything.\n\n They're always going to blame something in nature for everything that goes wrong, but you have to understand that primitive man did not have diseases.\n\n \r\n\r\nStill, those who ate primitively and ate raw meat and raw dairy have no diseases.\n\n The only disfiguration that I've seen in any of those tribes is the Fulani, which eats 90 to 95% only milk, raw milk.\n\n They have splotchy skin, maybe they're related to the cows, you know, splotches, but that is the only deformity that I see about them, but they're so familiar with it It's a beauty to them.\n\n Not a deformity because there's no disease that's a result of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou can live off milk and be well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, not us, them?\n\n They were raised that way.\n\n If we were raised all raw, we wouldn't have the poisons to need excess meat and all of that.\n\n It's a fiction.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (29) Natural Swimming Pools \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAbout swimming pools\n\n Is there any way to make a swimming pool that's not toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere are electrical chlorinators?\n\n There's electrical charged machines that send an electrical charge into the water and it makes a charged chlorine with no chloroform.\n\n \r\nThat's one way.\n\n Barbara Streisand just did hers with oxidation, the ozone.\n\n To me, that stinks.\n\n I don't like that smell on my body.\n\n So, I can prefer the electrical chlorinator.\n\n There's no odor to it at all.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat about the water, do you use tap water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're not gonna buy bottled water to put in the swimming pool, unless you're Michael Jackson, he did that?\n\n He had Avion put in his, but he didn't mind spending a million dollars to fill his pool.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOh, I meant to say you can put the apple cider vinegar with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can do that?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow many bottles would you need.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nDepends on how many gallons you would have?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI have a 24,000 gallon water tank and we've been swimming in it, it's a pond.\n\n We have guppies in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but do you like me.\n\n I have my algae growing in my hot tub.\n\n I like it green, slimy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI thought we should those question and answers in the hot tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nIt'd only fit about 14 people; I think we'd have trouble.\n\n Okay.\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI have this girl with me?\n\n I just want to discuss that because within Alaska, they have a law there in order for us to get any Marine mammal, that means the seal.\n\n They have to be 1/4th Native American.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIs anybody here one fourth native American.\n\n \r\nNope, nobody here?\n\n I'm 1/16th, can't help.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nYou could just say a little bit about iridology, how good it is, is it a diagnostic then animalization.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDon't use the word diagnostic because the medical professionals that work can not, nobody can diagnose, unless they are a licensed practitioner, practicing medicine with a licensed diagnosis.\n\n \r\nSo, I never diagnosed, I am.\n\n I analyze health, I don't diagnose disease.\n\n So that's how we get around that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Nausea After Milkshake DUmping Poisons \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPeople who usually get nausea after eating a cream shake or a milkshake\n\n Their liver, spleen, gallbladder, or pancreas, usually pancreas and liver are dumping into the stomach, poison.\n\n So, it's a good detoxification.\n\n Eat a little cheese before you start, a little after and in between to absorb those poisons that make you nauseous.\n\n  \r\nRemember nausea is always an indication that poisons are dumping into the stomach.\n\n Period.\n\n That's always what it is.\n\n You want them to dump their, it's the best place for them to go because the hydrochloric acid can neutralize them.\n\n The American Indians, if they ever got, let's say a scorpion bite from a black scorpion or they got a rattle snakebite.\n\n If there were a lactating animal around, they would drink the milk cause it would pull that poison to the stomach and it would neutralize it.\n\n The milk would absorb it and then the hydrochloric acid neutralizes any kind of insect poison.\n\n One time I got bitten pretty badly and there wasn't any raw milk around, so I got hydrochloric acid, put it in a solution of grape juice and injected it in my hip.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHydrochloric acid from where.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFrom a health food store, bottle of hydrochloric acid pills?\n\n \r\nuh, can jump off.\n\n You gotta get out one day we get into nausea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYour own hydrochloric acid could come up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat would be great?\n\n I was a vegetarian/fruitarian at the time.\n\n Shortly after the surgery, so I had none.\n\n There's none in my stomach, I have to go in my small intestines.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) No Fruit In Pain \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey are, but they're eating such a little amount that you can get away with eating a couple of tablespoons even with the meat\r\nWhen the Indians made their pemmican, they usually made it with blueberries or berries of any kind\n\n\r\nWell, I don't want, you didn't want you to have anything to detoxify, I wanted to stabilize you.\n\n You were in too much pain.\n\n He talks about stabilize.\n\n \r\nStay away from fruit if you're in pain.\n\n Stay away from fruit, well you were pain free for how months.\n\n \r\nI'd wait a couple of months before I did that, maybe one day a week?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying zero fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nZero fruit?\n\n If you're in pain, zero fruit.\n\n Zero high carbohydrate fruit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) No Mucus Lining, Eat Eggs \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nShe has no mucus lining in her stomach\n\n So, anything that goes in their hydrochloric acid starts eating away at her stomach lining.\n\n She needs to spend a month eating nothing but about 30 eggs a day.\n\n So, she could have 25 to 28 eggs a day.\n\n Just stick with eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, all day long and for about 22 to 30 days.\n\n That should coat and redo the lining of the stomach.\n\n \r\nShe's going to have some nausea because of it.\n\n It's still with the eggs, the eggs will prep the stomach to handle it and the other thing she could eat is fresh colostrum, but not refrigerated at room temperature and it's best if she leaves it out for 24 hours.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Pemmican \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n  \r\n\n  \r\nMakes them strong through the fall and winter Pemmican is not high meat\n\n Pemmican is meat that they preserve by drying it, beating it into a flour, mixing it with some kind of lard, baking in the sun.\n\n The dried meat will absorb that fat and press it into a block, about a 90-pound block and they do it every late summer.\n\n  \r\nAnd so, there's the north American Indians all through Canada, this was in case they didn't get fresh food.\n\n They always have this reserve, but they never ate the pemmican unless they had to, if they did not eat it they buried.\n\n Because it's enzyme and vitamin deficient, leaches from the body, they only use it in emergencies.\n\n Some of the adventures, the trailblazers that went across Canada and across the Americas all the way from the west coast to the east coast or the east coast to the west coast would take one 90-pound block of that and make it all 3000 miles across the country.\n\n  \r\nThey'd eat one chunk of it a day, about a half of a cup with lots of water and they can go on that all day.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n  \r\nSo, they were on raw foods then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n  \r\nNo?\n\n That isn't really a raw food, it's not cooked, but it's also not raw.\n\n Not fresh, there's no enzymes and vitamins active in something dried.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Perrier Had BEnzene Mid 80s From Inproper Rinsing \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot necessarily, if it's naturally carbonated the carbon destroys the bacteria, so you don't have to worry about\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\nPerrier in the mid-eighties had a problem.\n\n They weren't completely rinsing the bottles.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and was staying in there and pensioning people.\n\n But everybody rinses their bottles thoroughly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUncarbonated water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEither ozonation?\n\n chemical treatment, chlorine, always some way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about Mountain Valley.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven mountain valley, they're ozonated?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Phosphorus Cauterized 96 Degrees \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nAnd it takes about 96 degrees and to start cauterizing the phosphorus\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Pre Made Coconut Too High Degrees \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, what they do is they pre-heat 215 degrees, maximum over 96 degrees is okay\n\n\r\nThere is one called something like a Virgin Cocodaycream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCan you drink it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, some people want to eat pre-made stuff, so they don't have to juice the coconut?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut James Sells it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that's, that's naturally juiced, freshly juiced.\n\n This one is pre-made packaged and shipped, that one they do at about 118 degrees.\n\n So, I will use it for massage, but I won't use it.\n\n I will use a little bit in my primal facial body care cream.\n\n\r\nI've only seen in glass, but yeah, they do packages for a massage oil in plastic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Prion Disease Fictions \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nIt's a fiction\n\n The prion illness is a fact, but it's not because of anything natural it's because of all the chemicals and antibiotics that they've been giving these cows for so long.\n\n\r\nThey found the folded prions, yes.\n\n You'll also see, if you link the a U.\n\nS.\n\n militaries linked to dropping bombs on these herds to test biological warfare, you'll find that those herds always were subjected to some kind of chemical contamination.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Raw Soy Kills Humans & Birds \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nSoy is a product that is highly carcinogenic, is a known poison, it is illegal to put in even pesticides\n\n Yet, every time you eat a soy product, including soy sauce, highly concentrated, not good stuff.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd this comes from the fertilizer for the soybean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, this is in the soybean naturally?\n\n It's naturally in the soybean.\n\n Naturally the soybean, human or any bird eats a soy, you're going to die, raw.\n\n It would kill me cause poisons in it.\n\n \r\nSo, when they feed soy to all kinds of foul, chicken, turkeys, whatever it is, it has to be highly processed the same way it has to be for humans.\n\n Never raw and when they call it organic, it is not because you have to solvent treat some of it.\n\n So, would you wash your fruits with kerosene and eat it, call it organic.\n\n No, so it's a misnomer.\n\n \r\nYour Rosie chicken is fed 75 to 80% cooked, processed, solvent extracted soy.\n\n \r\nIt is a misnomer, it's a lie.\n\n It is not organic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you eat Rocky.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI said Rosie?\n\n We eat Rocky Jr, they feed theirs 75 - 80% raw carn.\n\n Even though it may not be organic, I'll still take the raw corn over the cooked processed solving extracted soy.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSoy milk they have now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSame thing, garbage?\n\n \r\n75-80.\n\n \r\nThen the rest is garbage soy.\n\n Rocky Jr.\n\n \r\nWell, Lilies would be the best, but Lilies won't sell us their chicken.\n\n They're an egg farm.\n\n \r\nI haven't investigated Harmony Farms.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Red Patches Cooked Chicken \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMy husband has big blotches on his back about this big\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhite colored.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey're red, like a rash and he has called you before, he has just dystonia from fluroxene and he eats the raw diet because you told her to have chicken once a week, but he's been having to have it more because he's detoxing so much?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mean cooked chicken.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYes, cooked chicken?\n\n So, I was wondering.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUhh, the primal facial body care cream.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n usually it's a mold, could be a yeast infection and remember all molds are there to break down degenerative tissue.\n\n If it's a yeast mold that means that it's feeding off of sugar damage.\n\n  \r\nIf it's like giardia it's a cross between sugars, sometimes alcohol and toxic cooked heterocyclic amines that damaged the cell.\n\n Heterocyclic amines from cooking meats.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, now he feels so bad he's eating cooked chicken almost every day or every other day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHe's not going to get beyond it then, he's just going to live in that state.\n\n He needs to soak in a hot tub, maybe an hour a day and put the primal facial body care on it from the recipe book.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow do you deal with different metabolic types.\n\n I don't know that much about it, but I've heard people talking about depending on where you are from Alaska to South Africa, there's different metabolic types that feel good, eating different foods?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's a theory that nobody has any proof to substantiate and I certainly haven't been able to find it.\n\n In my actual practice with people, I have Africans who eat this diet, vegetarians who lived their whole life as vegetarians who eat the diet.\n\n \r\nSo, I haven't found any, I've got Nordic people who eat this diet.\n\n They're the ones that are supposed to be the meat eaters, raw meat eaters from basically everywhere.\n\n \r\nI've got people from the tropics eating this diet and it's all favorable for everybody.\n\n So, this metabolic thing is somebodies' idealization on what they think should be happening in nature.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Smallpox Vaccine Linked To HIV \n \n**[2003]**\n\r\nBritish reporter linked the smallpox vaccine that was given to 75 million Africans had the aids virus infected in it\n\n What did they have in mind.\n\n Bush and his crew and Reagan and the crew?\n\n What did they do.\n\n They created a medical disaster?\n\n They came to the United States and other governments for help.\n\n\r\nWhat happened.\n\n They said, well, if we're going to help you with this aids disease, we need to control your resources?\n\n This is going to be a lot of money.\n\n So, the world bank's going to run your country.\n\n So, what'd they do, they got rid of a welfare class of people, so they didn't have to spend money on them and acquired access to their resources, the diamond mines and gold mines.\n\n\r\nIt's all about money, there's some people that don't give a shit about human nature, spirituality or anything and the Bush family is heavily.\n\n\r\nIt can be passed through blood in any disease.\n\n There's not an exception if you're getting transfusions.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) STDS Not Contagious, Yeasts Contagious \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSomebody asked me to talk about venereal disease and sexually transmitted venereal disease\n\n In my research there's only two categories of sexually transmitted venereal disease, and that's documented experiential, not philosophical and theoretical bullshit.\n\n  \r\nCrabs are definitely contagious because they live on the skin.\n\n So, you can be having sex with somebody, and they crawl on you, you're going to get crabs.\n\n The other yeasts, yeast that live in the skin.\n\n So, if a woman has a yeast infection or a man has candida and your perspiration gets onto each other, those yeasts can transfer to the other because they live on the skin.\n\n \r\nBut aids, HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis.\n\n It's all bullshit because they have to pass through five membranes after they get through the mucus, which is 8 to 10 layers, then they have to fight the white blood cells if they get into the blood.\n\n A microbiologist from Irvine University did a 37-page document on it that proved that 1 in 5 million chance of you getting aids or any other disease from intercourse, there's a myth out there from the moral majority that want to keep you from having sex because they believe it's against their religion that you enjoy sex.\n\n The industrial reason for wanting you to believe it is because you'll use condoms or you'll use spermicides, any of their products.\n\n  \r\nDo you know how many people are using condoms now every time they have sex.\n\n Do you know what a multi-billion dollar- trillion dollar a year that business is now?\n\n And 40 years ago, it was unheard of, they were making a couple of million a year?\n\n Now it's trillions of dollars a year.\n\n They have a reason to call things sexually transmitting.\n\n Everybody has their little angle, their interest.\n\n Self-interest to want you to believe that things like transmittable.\n\n Aids or HIV, when they found the virus in sperm, there were only two viruses, two virus bodies, the ability of those two virus body's to get through a women's mucus tissue, which is 8 to 10 layers thick, all those mucus fibers, get into five layers of mucus membrane walls, and then fight the white blood cells.\n\n Impossible.\n\n Ridiculous, not even a chance in 1 in 5 million of that.\n\n  \r\nBlood, when you bleed, you bleed outward, you don't bleed inwardly.\n\n You're bleeding outward.\n\n You're not bleeding inwards, so how the hell is a virus or germ going to get up in there.\n\n It's not going to happen.\n\n \r\nPeople are getting toxic, poisons are storing.\n\n If they're getting gonorrhea, the poisons are storing in the lymphatic system in their genitals.\n\n If it's syphilis, it's storing in the nerve tissue.\n\n If it's herpes, it's storing in the nerve endings, you have all of these diseases, which are the result of toxins in that area.\n\n \r\nSo, it's coincidental, when somebody had all these toxins building up at that particular time, and then they go have sex with somebody who's got that disease, it isn't because that person's got that disease.\n\n It's coincidental because that person's been building up the toxins for a long time in that area, all of a sudden it happens.\n\n It's like saying, well, I got struck by lightning because there were a bunch of cows in the bathroom or because there were trees all around.\n\n \r\nGot trees all over the world, how many people were getting struck by lightning.\n\n It's coincidental that you have to be in the right place at the right time for the lightning strike?\n\n There's no madness to that.\n\n There's no theory to that.\n\n There's no contagious theory about lightning striking you.\n\n \r\nBut they love to do it, the medical profession makes a lot of money on the bacteria theory.\n\n Their whole premise, their entire profession is built on germ theory.\n\n Germs are the cause, not toxins, not pollution, not poisons, germs are the cause.\n\n Do you blame the vultures in the crows for the dead animals that they find.\n\n No there's a cleanup crew?\n\n \r\nThat's what parasites are.\n\n That's what bacteria is.\n\n Virus is a joke.\n\n Virus is impossible It to be contagious, they're not alive.\n\n Virus is the body building solvents, soaps, to clean out the body.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) SUgar Introduced 1800s \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\nSugars were full-blown and the sugar came in heavily in the late 1800s, and it was considered classy, panache to have candy in your home because you had to be rich to afford candy\n\n So, people would eat candy and think, oh, I am so terrific.\n\n What they were doing was poisoning themselves faster than anybody else.\n\n \r\nThat's why the rich children were always more unhealthy.\n\n They had more eye problems, they had more physical problems.\n\n They were weaker punier because they got all this medical attention, and they got all this bad food.\n\n It was elitist.\n\n \r\nLet me tell you there's lots of dogs and cats out there and other animals who interbreed all the time and don't have those problems.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Unatural Hormones From Pollution \n \n**[2003]**\n \r\nShe was saying because of the pollution that we have; a lot of women and men are not producing their normal hormone because they are producing them, but what's happening is, is that because hormones are higher and fat than most other substances created by the body they go for the toxins, the toxins go for the fat\n\n So, what it does is it turns the hormones into detoxification substances that will bind with those poisons.\n\n Then you can no longer them as energy hormone or hormones to build bones or hormones to function normally.\n\n You don't have enough fat in your blood and especially in winter.\n\n \r\nBecause there's not enough fat in the blood.\n\n So, the body will start using those hormones as fat toxin binders that.\n\n \r\nAsk Lisa.\n\n She said once she gained all that weight, she's not a bitch anymore and that happens to all the women.\n\n This is a fine size, women who have excess get happy, much happier.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Vegans No Energy \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, it depends if you're not hyperactive because you're thin, then it could be because you're not creating any hormones because your body cannot afford to burn itself\n\n Eat itself up.\n\n When I was a fruitarian for a long time, I was always calm because I had no fucking energy to get upset.\n\n When it gt down to it, I could get very irritable, very quick in somebodies face because there were killing animals and eating animals! \r\nDiehard vegetarian, but I had to learn my lesson and then when I became so weak that I was so mellow.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nSo, the issue about the size of the fat in cow's milk vs goats' milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's hypothetical garbage?\n\n If you're eating it raw, you're going to digest it whether it's large.\n\n What does that mean, it means I'm going to be more nourished if I eat more.\n\n So, I'll take a bigger molecule of fat from the cow, as opposed to a goat.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIn other words, we throw away what we have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nShould I have goats' milk or cow's milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it depends?\n\n It depends upon the person.\n\n If you're irritable I'd say no or mix it.\n\n \r\nThere are other ways to stimulate your adrenal glands other than goats' milk.\n\n \r\nThere's the coffee substitute and there's also red onion.\n\n There's also some garlic, all those will stimulate adrenaline.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Viruses Are Coincedantal Not Contagious \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNo, only if they had a liver problem\n\n \r\nIf they have toxins in the liver that causes a detoxification, where they will naturally be utilized.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, something like the black plague where whole population gets it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to understand that it was in England in the highly populated areas, there was no refrigeration, they would cook their foods?\n\n They would keep them because there was no refrigeration.\n\n High amounts of verotoxin from these molds that would feed on the food, and they would just keep loading themselves with toxins, as well as the byproducts of the bacteria eating these cooked foods, they would get so inundated that everybody would break out about the same time.\n\n It's like I have a full tree of 50 jar bottles and I'm filling all at the same rate, they're all going to spill over at the same time.\n\n \r\nYou're going to have an epidemic, the plague, and it's always somebody else who did it, not their bad habits.\n\n  \r\nWell, just remember that virus are not alive, it's a solvent that your body can make.\n\n It's like I got the same soap in my house and somebody over there and everybody else had Tide soap in their house.\n\n It's a solvent, that's a virus.\n\n  \r\nIt isn't contagious because everybody has it because everybody's produced it.\n\n \r\nYeah, but their description may have been very, very doctored or very, very polished.\n\n It's like the documentation I got from Pennsylvania, and they were blaming raw milk on this epidemic.\n\n They said that 90% of those people who got sick had consumed the raw milk.\n\n What about the other 10%.\n\n What did they eat, why did they get it and they had no contact?\n\n Why did they get at the same time as everybody else.\n\n You're saying it's very obvious?\n\n It's not very obvious.\n\n No, it's their belief that makes them distort information.\n\n \r\nYou have it systemically.\n\n If you have it, you have it systemically.\n\n The nervous system is the most active passageway in the body.\n\n It moves faster than lymph and blood.\n\n \r\nAgain, you're talking about a virus.\n\n A virus is a protein body, it's not alive.\n\n There's no contagious.\n\n You cannot have something that replicates itself by manufacturer.\n\n This is not a breeding substance that multiplies, it only replicates by manufacturer in the body.\n\n That's the whole fallacy about it.\n\n \r\nThat's why people get so caught up in the belief system.\n\n They don't look at the rationale.\n\n How is virus formed, it's not alive.\n\n How's the reproduce.\n\n How does it replicate, because the body makes it just like we make soap, clean out the system?\n\n It is not that way.\n\n If the child eats what the parents are eating and that child was produced from a parent where lots of toxins filled up in the nervous system and that child had the same kind of a system, born to same kind of system, they would get herpes.\n\n \r\nIt may be simply coincidental that the parent notices it when they had one at the same time.\n\n Oh, I kissed the baby, I gave it to the baby.\n\n You didn't get it from kissing the baby.\n\n You gave it because you caused the baby to have toxins in the nerve endings, wasn't the kiss that did it.\n\n It wasn't the contagion that did it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIt's because the toxins were transmitted and then the virus will react.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to look at where they'd have to penetrate?\n\n You bleed, you bleed out, sores seep out, you don't seep inward.\n\n \r\nSo, how's it going to get in.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBut maybe there's some other kind of toxin and that is transmitted?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're looking at a myth?\n\n If I take water balloons and try to throw that through a house, it's not going to happen.\n\n That's a myth maybe the house that has a leak in it at some time and you have to be throwing water balloons at that particular time and all of a sudden, a water main breaks, breaks at that particular time.\n\n Did the water balloons create that disaster, the water that's in the house.\n\n \r\nI do not expect a lot of you to really grasp it because you're so brainwashed, but if you take biochemistry and you really study it and understand that virus are not alive virus or protein bodies, and they can only be formed within a body?\n\n By a body, by a body's lymph system as a solvent, as a detoxifier, then you understand those protein bodies are nothing other than solvents \r\nLike we have kerosene, we use kerosene, we use alcohol to disintegrate, even vitamin supplements, herbal extracts.\n\n \r\nIf there were enough of those virus bodies in that blood and the body said, oh, this is how you make those.\n\n Let me see if I can replicate them.\n\n Then yes, the body says, I liked that.\n\n I want them to get rid of that nerve ending toxicity.\n\n Then it could manufacture it from a love transfusion.\n\n \r\nYes.\n\n But you know, if the parent is feeding the child garbage that stores in that child's nerve endings, that's what creates the herpes.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Water Breaks Down Sutf WHen Detox Or Losing Weight \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nGerolsteiner's the only one that's okay\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nGerolsteiner, Pellegrino, any of the naturally sparkling waters?\n\n \r\nOzonated isn't great, it's not severely harmful.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat about Evian water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEvian, I haven't investigated lately, but they used to be fine?\n\n Not pardon.\n\n \r\nDistilled water is the worst water you can drink?\n\n It will just rip your system to pieces because it's the hungriest water, leaches everything \r\nThat's different.\n\n That's high in bacteria.\n\n Rainwater is full of bacteria.\n\n That's a different kind of distilled water, but still, it's not a good idea to drink a lot of rainwater either.\n\n What does rain do.\n\n Rain goes down and dissolves the rock in the ground so the plants can eat?\n\n \r\nThat's what it does, if you drink too much water, it'll dissolve and leech the nutrients out of your digestive tract and blood.\n\n Now, when you're going through a detoxification or downsizing, if you have a problem losing weight, water can be helpful to resolve some of that.\n\n You lose weight quick when you don't want to have much water.\n\n \r\nI don't say no water?\n\n I say, keep your water intake low.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) When Herpes Came ABout \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGenital warts been around a long time\n\n \r\nHerpes really came about no more than a hundred years ago, but they say oh, we've got nerve ending damage.\n\n They didn't have a microscope to be able to figure out what it was before then, there were not enough of them to do investigations, but let me give you this scenario.\n\n\r\nYou have two people dating.\n\n They go out and eat the same toxic food from the same canned food, with all this metal toxicity, highly acidic, let's say it had gotten botulism in it, low grade botulism.\n\n They started eating that, one broke out before the other one did.\n\n\r\nNot a matter of one gave it to the other, one started detoxing before the other.\n\n That's how it happened.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've had genital herpes for 22 years, and after being on your diet they went away.\n\n I was married and the whole time my wife never got herpes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe just have to get beyond these myths, they are ingrained in you.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) WHole Foods Barely Organic \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat about the non New Zealand beef\n\n Whole foods has New Zealand and non New Zealand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhole Foods bought the ranch.\n\n Whole foods is a big farce.\n\n You go around and you see everywhere in the store go organic, go organic.\n\n You rarely see even 1% of the food in their stores organic.\n\n So, it's a big hype bullshit.\n\n \r\nBig bullshit, their meat they feed 15% bakery waste, which is stale boiled in oil donuts, and they call that natural beef.\n\n What cow do you know goes around eating donuts.\n\n \r\nYou the best of what you can get, what the best to get is the New Zealand grass fed beef?\n\n \r\nThe Coleman beef that Wild Oates carries, they do feed theirs some byproducts.\n\n Some of the feed is a byproduct.\n\n So, it's not all perfect and they don't promise that it's organic either, but it's still better than Ralphs or Savon's and its' better than Whole Foods donut fed.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) You Can Get Aids From Blood Transfusions \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe first book called \"The Bio Attack Alert\" documented it\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, Rock Hudson was on drugs.\n\n He got HIV/AIDS?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, he got a transfusion.\n\n So, you can get a disease if you go to get somebody's blood pumped into you, definitely.\n\n Because that's direct inundation into the system, and a lot of people got it all from transfusions and gave their blood and other people got it.\n\n  \r\nThat's why only 10% of the population who have had liver problems were getting the hepatitis B vaccine and that's why they were getting it, but of course the government- the medical professional is not going to tell you the real reason these people got aids.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) 40 Years To Clean Out The Body, 21 To Reach Ful Maturity \n \n**[2004]**\n \r\nLike I said the Recipe Book, it takes 40 years to clean out the body\n\n It took 20 to 21 years to build your body, to come to full maturation.\n\n Then your growth hormones reduced to a minimum, unless you eat lots of meat and then you can keep them going your whole life.\n\n Raw meat, if you don't you won't do it.\n\n \r\nIt takes just as long to tear the body down and rebuild it.\n\n  \r\nSo, it takes you 21 years to disassemble it and 20 years to rebuild it.\n\n \r\nSo, you're doing it all the time, so it's weaving in and out.\n\n So, it takes 40 years according to Howell and his work with rats and Pottenger and his work with cats.\n\n \r\nIt was the same way; they took very diseased animals, and it took them five generations before they became optimal.\n\n \r\nFor us, five generations that takes 7 to 7.\n\n5 years to regenerate every cell in the body one time.\n\n Five times that, it's about forty years, and I've still got 18 years to go, but I'm already satisfied.\n\n 35 years ago, I was a worm on the floor, severe pain constantly and I couldn't sleep unless I was in a bath.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) 50% White&Red Meat Mitigates Pain \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe can only help those who need help\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI read an article recently that claim that if you took a teaspoon of Cod liver oil for each 50 pounds of body weight, in other words, 150 pounds it takes three, and you put it in either milk or fresh squeezed orange juice once a day, do you think that has any affect?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, any of your pressed oils helps your body makes solvents to dissolve toxicity?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt has omega-3s.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAgain, that's another stretch.\n\n If you have more toxicity in the body, you need all nutrients.\n\n Not just omega-6 and omega-3.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm focusing on arthritis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nArthritis is mainly toxicity in the joints that's built up in the joints.\n\n So, you've got bacteria in there trying to eat up the dead toxicity or the toxicity in the cells that have been destroyed by the poisons that have gone to that joint.\n\n\r\nSo, the bacteria is not your problem.\n\n It's the toxins that have destroyed the tissue that the bacteria is feeding on.\n\n Usually if you'll eat, you know, don't eat as much red meat cut down to 50-50, 50% red meat, 50% white meat, and you're eating the lubrication formulas.\n\n You'll mitigate\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Baths \n \n**[2003],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nCan I bring that up now, what would the problem would be\n\n I was going into the bath without waiting 7 to 10 minutes before going into the bath cause I thought that's what you're supposed to do?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I always said, wait 7 to 10 minutes before going into the bath.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo now, I mean, after all these years, I don't know.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nJust eat your regular diet.\n\n It's going to have to detox gradually, getting in the bath is going to help because it's going to discharge a little bit of it out your skin.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDid you say the thyroid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's what I was going to say.\n\n I'm already answering you.\n\n When the throat, lungs and sinuses, it's always this part of the body.\n\n Anywhere from the throat, all the way up to the top of the head.\n\n Brain, eyeballs, sinuses, thyroid, parathyroid, lymph glands, whatever's detoxing.\n\n Could go on for a year.\n\n Some people I see it.\n\n I had one person had diarrhea for a year and four months, and he functions fine and he's big as Clay.\n\n \r\nHere's a guy who has diarrhea and he can still put on the weight.\n\n Most people with diarrhea, can't put on the weight, but he was really skinny when he started.\n\n Now he over the diarrhea and it doesn't ever affect him.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n1 year and 4 months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, 1 year and 4 months?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHe's not getting rid of this bacteria or something.\n\n Flora, the bacteria?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it isn't working as well?\n\n He's not absorbing all the fluids is the system, but he still retains- I think drinks too much water, but people only listen so much.\n\n \r\nBut he's doing well, so I don't get on his case, anybody that does well with what they're doing, even when they're doing things that I suggest they don't do, as long as they're doing okay, I won't get on their case.\n\n But if they call me about a problem, and I know it's *hindered* by what they're doing, then I'll say you've got to stop.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nGlen Ivy is also good because of the hot water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but you've got clay in that water.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThat could draw it out too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but you don't have the chemicals and poisons in that water, so you don't have to put the ingredients in the water.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYeah, I know.\n\n I'm saying for people that took baths without putting it in to draw out the poisons.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, we're talking about city water.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI know that, but I'm saying if they did use city water- \r\n\n \r\nIt still wouldn't help as much; you need those ingredients in the water to help draw some of those out because they're already imbedded in your skin.\n\n They get absorbed deep into the connective tissue.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nNo, I'm saying it will draw out what you have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, it won't draw out everything.\n\n That's why there are certain nutrients in that combination that can pull out a lot more than.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Baths & Toxic Water \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou have to move or turn over or something, but in the bath, I have certain things in the bath\n\n You know, I've mentioned many times having the milk, the sea salt and the vinegar in the water allows the body to be slightly buoyant and when you're in there for that 40 minutes, the electrical system reverses, it doesn't send the charges to the brain, it starts sending them out through the skin into the water.\n\n \r\nThat's what takes away the pain.\n\n \r\nSo, I say to somebody who has systemic pain, or even a severe pain in particular spot like the back, the spine, get in a hot bath with those ingredients and spend an hour in there, and then you'll be free.\n\n It's like, it's like a miracle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat if you're sensitive to chemicals in the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLike I said, if you put the milk in there?\n\n You put two to three cups of milk in there, that neutralizes all the chemicals in the water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWithout having a filter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's always good to have a filter because then some of those nutrients that you put in an bath will feed your body?\n\n \r\nWe have the 192 chemicals in our water in LA.\n\n So, the shower for that.\n\n  \r\nIf you have a three-filter system on the outside of your house, major ones, the most you can remove is 50% of the toxins.\n\n If you have one of those little filters, you're going to remove is a third.\n\n \r\nYou have to let it sit in the bath water up to 7 to 10 minutes before you get in, but you can't mix it with water and then send it out the shower.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBecause once you put this stuff in the water, you can go right in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you have to wait seven to 10 minutes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n2-3 cups?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBecause it has to absorb.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt has to absorb those poisons in the water?\n\n If i got into LA city water when I first did it, and that time there was only 158 chemicals in the water.\n\n I moved here in 1966, and when I'd get into the city water here, and if I took a nap, in seven minutes I'd be just like this, literally shaking.\n\n I couldn't stop.\n\n \r\nMy heart would pound, my blood pressure would rise and I'd just shake, Id tremble.\n\n I couldn't hold anything.\n\n It was that bad.\n\n That's when I experimented putting different things in the water to neutralize those toxins and that was the best formula I could come up with and it works perfectly because I could spend 10 - 18 hours in the bathtub and sleep in it.\n\n \r\nAnd I also discovered that if I let out about, you know, I had a tall foot tub during most of that time, which is pot metal.\n\n So, metal holds heat much longer than plastic does.\n\n So, I could go 1.\n\n5 - 2 hours without waking freezing to death but I just let 3-4 inches out of the tub and then put scolding how water and keep it moving around until it got so hot, and I'd go back to sleep for another hour or two and I never had to put more ingredients in the water, the animal.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to wait 10 minutes before- \r\n\n \r\n7 - 10 minutes.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow long before you put the ingredients in, do you put it in right away.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends about how hot you have the water?\n\n What I do is when I heat the tub up, so the tub doesn't cool down quickly, I put scolding hot water, so the first half of that water is nothing, but hot scalding water.\n\n Let it sit for 10 minutes and it heats the entire tub.\n\n Then I put lukewarm water in, and they get to a temperature that's just maybe a degree or two hotter than I like it, maybe 106-107 degrees.\n\n When I get in, I like it to be 105 degrees and I put all the ingredients in when it hits about 105-107 and then I let it sit for seven to 10 minutes before I get in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much salt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTwo tablespoons of sea salt?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nNonfat milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh no, fatty milk?\n\n You don't use skim milk, except to make cheese.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, you have to wait before you put the ingredients in because it's too hot for the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf it's too hot you're gonna have to wait for it too cool down or you could put some cold water in to cool it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOtherwise, you could just put it in right away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIt doesn't have to be raw milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, it definitely does?\n\n Because mostly what it's going to do is pull poisons and absorb poisons out of your cells.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Cells Make Virus \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou said the virus creates itself with the DNA\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, cells make the soaps, cells make virus?\n\n Virus are nothing other than soaps, solvents to dissolve certain kinds of tissue because your body can't use bacteria or parasites.\n\n \r\nWhen the cell makes the protein body that becomes the solvent, the virus.\n\n \r\nIt puts a DNA in it so that the virus only addresses certain tissue.\n\n  \r\nIf your body made a virus that would dissolve every cell in your body, because every cell is toxic because you've been on a cooked diet all of your life, you would be a mess.\n\n You would die.\n\n So, when the body makes a virus, it puts a DNA in there to restrict that virus's activity to dissolve only particular cells.\n\n \r\nThat's why when you get a virus like a flu, it's either intestinal or it's muscular or it's neurological, it's always a selective part of your body.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, you're saying the body actually makes the tapeworm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the tapeworms exist intercellularly, the body doesn't have to make them?\n\n Every cell contains parasites and bacteria.\n\n Every cell has every kind of bacteria and every kind of parasite that exists for animal tissue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, it's like a tool that the body has whenever it needs to use it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCorrect?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, people who are eating cooked food, just wondering why they aren't sick \r\n\n \r\nBecause they may be too toxic and if you're eating bad stuff like coffee and alcohol.\n\n What that does is it creates a condition in the blood that prevents you from doing anything other than controlling the contaminations in the blood, neurological system, lymph and intestines.\n\n Just from the contamination, which you're eating.\n\n \r\nSo, a lot of people aren't able to detoxify normally.\n\n They'll go into their colds, they'll go into their flus, they'll have their aches and pains, and that's always a detoxification, whether it's thorough and correct and they can regenerate from it depends upon what they eat and on this diet, it's the only diet that will ensure that the detoxification you do is thorough and that it may not be all done at one time because of a particular area and that you will heal following the detoxification.\n\n \r\nFever is always as an indication that the detoxification is completed.\n\n You could have had a detoxification existing for year and a half or two years in your body and all of a sudden, when the body says I got too much of the garbage accumulated, now it's time to dump.\n\n It goes into a flu or a cold and you start dumping all this mucus, that's the poisons leaving the body in the mucus or in the ear wax or in the tear ducts.\n\n \r\nOr though the tears or the mucus in the mouth or the salivary glands or perspiring, vaginal discharge, fecal discharge builds it into the hair and the nails, whatever the body can discharge it will.\n\n  \r\nWell, let's say that you had a vaccine, and the thimerosal went into that shoulder, goes into a detoxification.\n\n You can better believe that you're going to suffer pain.\n\n Most people will suffer pain because it takes about 1000 white cells to harness one molecule of mercury to keep it from causing damage or 2000 fat cells.\n\n That's for one molecule of mercury.\n\n That's why when you have puss come out of a pimple, you have 3 or 4 molecules of a toxin and all the rest are white cells, 100,00s of white cells.\n\n \r\nAnd that's mainly what you're discharging is white cells in a very toxic environment.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd does bacteria do the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, bacteria consumes the substance and reduces into a small amount of what it consumed, so it reduces the waste that you have to eliminate?\n\n But if you take, let's say a solvent, you're going to clean the floor, you diluted water and then when you finish, you've got this whole bucket of contaminated water.\n\n That's what happens in the body because the virus doesn't consume it and reduce it.\n\n The virus spreads it all around in a fluid.\n\n That's why viruses are nasty, but if we weren't so poisoned, we'd be able to use virus in parasites.\n\n**[Think he meant bacteria and parasites]**\n \r\nThank God my body was able to handle a parasite the first time.\n\n When I saw that tapeworm come out, I thought wow! Finally, the poisons are out of my body, and I can actually breed some bacteria and parasites finally, and if I hadn't had that to help me do that detoxification, I probably would have created serious damage in my intestines.\n\n \r\nSo, it was very helpful.\n\n Any more questions about that.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nYou say the cells produce the virus, why do people say some virus are contagious?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIs tide Soap contagious because it's found in every household?\n\n \r\nThat's as simple as that?\n\n People make money by you going for medical treatment for a virus, it's just a soap that your body makes, and it can't be contagious if it's a soap.\n\n If it's manufactured in yourself.\n\n I mean if I inject it into you, your body might say, okay, I can use that virus and I will replicate it and manufacturer utilize that.\n\n \r\nWhat she's going through right now, she's not going to be contagious for us, the only things that are really contagious \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Chia Seeds To Help Regular Bowel Movements \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYeah\n\n If you want to use a non-binder or something to help you move and become regular, you use chia seeds.\n\n Chia seeds are very fine, they are the size of a poppy seed, about the size of a pinhead and they're round and they're not divided into a half like flax seed and a lot of the other seeds, they are a round like a poppy and completely integrated.\n\n \r\nSo when they open up, they have like a volcano top and they secrete this gelatin out the top and there's no sharp edge at any time ever and if you can take about, depending upon your size, 3 to 4 tablespoons of that, soak it in 6 - 8 ounces of good water for 24 hours, the seeds secrete a solution that turns the water into a jello, a gelatin.\n\n \r\nAnd then you mix that stirred into a lubrication formula, and then you eat that at night then you have some good bowel movements.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Cilantro 5% Metal Detox \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMaybe you're having too much of it\n\n I'm sure you need some parsley.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI use cilantro.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCilantro causes heavy metal detox, so don't use more than 5% or your juice.\n\n Well, it creeps up on you and when it gets you.\n\n It's not easy to get out of the metal detox.\n\n\r\nIt may sneak up on you and once it hits, I'm warning you.\n\n If you're using 100 oz of juice, that means 5 oz would be cilantro.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cod Liver Oil \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nCod liver oil is completely solvent treated\n\n The FDA requires it.\n\n So all that from Norway they say is pure.\n\n It's solvent treated because they have to purify it.\n\n Even though it's not heated, they solvent purify and that solvent is almost identical to brake fluid.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Cucumber Cools The Body \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nCucumber sometimes cools the body too much\n\n\r\nYou'd get cold too easily.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Detox & Eggs \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut it may be unrelated to the egg\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, but the egg could be helping it process out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the body will use the nutrients from the egg, yes, but it usually takes a while to get into the blood.\n\n It has to go through the duodenum, the fat has to be digested.\n\n It takes 45 minutes - 1 hour before it leaves the duodenum.\n\n\r\nSo, it doesn't happen instantly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Drinking Blood \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow about getting fresh blood\n\n Does it detox or does it do what meat does?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n Your red blood cells just help red blood cells, they're full of the nutrients that red blood cells are concentrated in.\n\n It's just another food.\n\n I've eaten blood many times and I don't like it, cause it coagulates so quickly and to drink it instantly.\n\n \r\nI've killed many chickens and ducks and stuff like that and it almost makes me nauseous drinking in that way.\n\n \r\nBut 3 years ago, I was in Hawaii, Pangaea and we had decided to do a celebration since I was there, and nobody had ever killed an animal and butchered it.\n\n So I agreed to do it while I was there.\n\n \r\nSo, we had drummers.\n\n We had about five vegetarians around the group and from the surrounding community and they just want to watch us.\n\n So, there were about 15 of us all together and we took the goat and we put a harness around it and spun it around.\n\n and I would chant to it as his eyes came to try and put it to sleep and the other guy would spin it around every time the back legs came to.\n\n So, he just kept spinning the goat until he went to sleep and then we took the front harness off and just had the back harness and had them hanging, legs up and head down.\n\n I cut his juggler vein and we had two gallons jars, half with goats' milk.\n\n \r\nWhen we bled it, I cut the jugular vein and bled a half a gallon of blood into each gallon jar and mixed it with the milk and then it didn't coagulate.\n\n It was great, and I watched everybody, even the vegetarians tried it.\n\n  \r\nIt's like some people were even painted with blood like it's part of a ritual, some people get into that, and it doesn't hurt me, but I guess like a costume party and even the vegetarians accepted as we passed it around to drink some and you see everybody's face going, expecting this awful taste and then they got into their mouth, and you see their eyes brighten.\n\n  \r\nWe drank the 2 gallons with 15 people in 45 minutes, gone.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIt just tastes like milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTastes like ice cream?\n\n The blood makes it so rich; it tastes like ice cream.\n\n I mean, it's just so bizarre how it can taste so incredibly different than you'd expect.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow did you feel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, I was charged for a couple of days, sexually, everything?\n\n Everything was going.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Enzyme Supplements \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nSo in your raw fresh foods you have enzymes that are all easily disassembled and reassorted, and what those enzyme supplements seem to do is kick ass on the pancreas\n\n Keeps the pancreas from being able to work.\n\n cause the pancreas has to deal with all the enzymes, so it isn't that it does it in a helpful way.\n\n Causes more toxicity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Every Joint Hurts = No Fat Reserves \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBasically, what I'm dealing with is every joint in my body hurts\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're much too thin.\n\n You have no reserved fats to help pull the poisons out, and that's how viruses work.\n\n They make everything sore.\n\n \r\nif you have toxins that are in the joints, and they're deteriorating tissue, and you have bacteria eating up the deteriorated tissue, yes.\n\n \r\nIf you have arthritis, you would be in severe pain.\n\n \r\nYou just need to use a lot of fat, especially butter, and no more than 50% red meat at a time with white meat and they should be eaten together.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Fat From Carbs Is An Acetone With Little Strength \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nThe high carbs in terms of when you're making a fat from a carb is an acetone that has very poor strength to it, very little calories in it\n\n A molecule of fat has 2.\n\n5 calories.\n\n Molecule of acetone made from a carb that has got 1.\n\n So it has less than half the energy producing ability.\n\n\r\nPreviously, a lot of your athletes suck eggs.\n\n\r\nBack when I was a kid, all the bodybuilders were throwing 5, 6, 8 eggs into a milkshake.\n\n Everything else was pasteurized and cooked except for the fruit that they would put and the eggs, but they used to have protein powder, which was garbage.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Flax Oil Will Harden & Vegetable Oils Are Rock \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFlax oil too\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFlax oil, no?\n\n But remember I've said that that vegetable oils turn into rock.\n\n Here's a vegetable oil right here.\n\n They sell them at Wild Oats, and you can buy a variety of them.\n\n They are rock, animal fats never get that way.\n\n \r\nCause I only bathe once every five days is when people say I smell like cheese on like the 4th or 5th day.\n\n No, I put it between my clothes.\n\n So, it fragrances my clothes.\n\n \r\nBut the whole point here is that this is what vegetable fats become, rock.\n\n That's what's causing all the hardening of the arteries and the heart.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do they make it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, they justt collect it?\n\n You collect it and let it sit and in a year, you have rock.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes that include flax seed oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, flax seed oil has the same nature, it just doesn't get as hard as quickly?\n\n That's why I say in my book if you're using it for cancer, use a very small amount.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Forced Detox & Fermented Foods \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nFirst, I'm going to talk to you about- my next book is on detoxification\n\n  \r\nSo, I've been experimenting with detoxification because a lot of people all about being gung-ho and doing a lot.\n\n \r\nI want to caution you on it because two months ago, I decided to do an intense detoxification to the limit.\n\n  \r\nWhat I do when I detoxify is pre-fermentations, bacteria's cause fermentation, bacteria's are in the foods before you cook them.\n\n When you cook them, the bacteria is out.\n\n All the bacteria, the enzymes, vitamins, everything is gone.\n\n So, when you take those properties into your body, and when the body is finished utilizing them.\n\n There is no natural ecological recycling, it hardens in the system, and it stays there waiting for some bacteria to help ferment it and detoxify it, like with a virus.\n\n \r\nEspecially if you're so poisoned, then you can't harbor a parasite or any bacteria?\n\n Those are the easiest ways to detoxify.\n\n When your body uses bacteria or parasites.\n\n They consume up to 100 times their weight in a day, and then excrete very small amounts about 1% of what they digest.\n\n So, it's a very small amount of toxin that we have to neutralize and secrete or excrete.\n\n So, it's very easy for the body to handle it.\n\n When the body has to make a fermentation and make a virus, because virus are not alive.\n\n The whole idea of having a vaccine for viruses is the most absurd thing in the world.\n\n It's like taking vaccine because you have tide soap in your house.\n\n \r\nThe cells make virus.\n\n When they take virus out of a body and put it in a Petri dish, it'll breed a cell and you can keep cells growing.\n\n There is no increase in virus.\n\n It is whatever they put in there is all that exists.\n\n However, when there's a cellular environment in that petri dish, then all of a sudden there are more of them.\n\n They increase, that's because cells make them.\n\n It's like how we used to make soaps for our bodies.\n\n We used to take coconut and 90% of all soaps are made with coconut 100 years ago, 50 years ago.\n\n So, when you make something from organic substances, you're going to have organic matter in it.\n\n So, they say virus has DNA in it, sure the cell makes an agent to dissolve toxicity, it puts a DNA in it of the tissue that it wants the virus to dissolve.\n\n So, that's how that's like putting a certain chemical, a certain agent in that solution, so that only addresses certain kinds of toxic cells.\n\n Otherwise, you'd be disintegrating because you've got a lot of toxic cells in your body from eating cooked foods all of your life.\n\n \r\nSo, over the years, starting in 1976, I started fermenting the different foods that I consumed.\n\n I consumed a lot of Rice Krispies, a lot of corn flakes with lots of sugar on it.\n\n So I fermented all these foods over the years, but I've never let my milk go to a high alcohol state because I used to consume a half a gallon of milk a day and then when I got away from home at 16, I was drinking a gallon a day cause there was no restriction and I had a lot of milk, but it was always pasteurized unless I was on the farm and that was only for a few weeks a year, and then my grandmother got to boiling on the stove.\n\n  \r\nAnyway, probably the most consumed food that I had was the milk, the dairy.\n\n So, I knew that that was going to be a hell of a detoxification when I did it.\n\n So, what I did was I took a quart of milk, put it in a half gallon jar, put some maca in it, which is a substance, it's higher carbohydrate substance.\n\n It was sun dried because it would cause a heck of a fermentation and it would give it that cereal variety, like tremendous amounts of cereal when I was a child with milk.\n\n \r\nSo, I know that those two would be connected well together.\n\n So, I put them together and fermented it for a little over two weeks out of the refrigerator in a cupboard and the hottest time of the summer and when I popped the top off of it, it was so fermented that the alcohol burned my nos.\n\n So, what did I do.\n\n I had three cups in one day because everybody's talks about these gung-ho issues, you know, on the internet, you know, and all that?\n\n \r\nS,o I wanted to see what would happen.\n\n Well, I was in diarrhea every 20 minutes for 36 hours.\n\n Diarrhea lasted about three weeks.\n\n I lost 20 pounds in six days.\n\n I am still having it, and what it did was- whenever your body has a tremendous amount of sugar in the system, and it's an overabundance and your body can afford to make a tapeworm, tapeworms, eat excessive sugars in the intestines.\n\n \r\nSo, I kept dumping all these sugars from all that toxic milk that I had, and it caused a detox, so I had all this tissue alcohol destroyed, sugar destroyed, and carbohydrates destroyed tissue from the milk.\n\n So, it was the heaviest detox I've ever.\n\n done and I got a tapeworm.\n\n First time I've had a parasite in my life, it was great.\n\n I just passed it out three days ago.\n\n So, thank God it was there to help me detox because for about four weeks I was basically unable to work.\n\n I started to travel, but I didn't want to.\n\n I had to sleep like 10, 11 hours a day, which is unlike me because I sleep usually 4.\n\n5 to 5.\n\n \r\nSo, if you want to do detoxification, do it in a mellow way cause I'm suffering right now.\n\n I mean, you know, from all that radiation that I had, cauterized my spine, there was one part of my back that was in constant pain for years, about 15, 16 years and what I put on a lot of weight, and I hold the weight, there's very little pain.\n\n Even if I have little sores or something, detoxification's going on, they are very mild.\n\n The symptoms are mild.\n\n However, this way the symptoms aren't mild.\n\n I can go into a pain in the chest.\n\n  \r\nI mentioned the last time I was eight years old, first grade I swallowed a nickel and it got it stuck in my diaphragm and the esophagus right at the bronchial, and in those days, nickel was a third mercury.\n\n So, the mercury was in there so long, cause I was autistic and I didn't know how to tell anybody that I had a nickel lodged in my esophagus.\n\n So finally, I went to the principal Sister Virginia, and kept pointing I had something wrong, swallowed something, and it was caught here.\n\n So, she got me some milk and I washed it down with milk and it went right down, but that sat there for about three hours.\n\n Whenever you have anything going into the esophagus, your body secretes tremendous amount of hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, it dissolved some of that nickel and that mercury went all into that area and that's part of what started giving me angina at age 15.\n\n5, with all the other medical drugs.\n\n Angina is heart attacks, and I used to have 4 to 7 a week.\n\n So, all of a sudden, a few months ago, right before I did that heavy detox, I was dealing with that.\n\n The pain would get so bad, and I couldn't move and the only thing that would resolve it.\n\n I did everything.\n\n Pain formula, the heat packs, everything.\n\n I felt like I was going to die from a heart attack, but I knew it wasn't the heart, the pain was excruciating.\n\n So, I started just moaning aloud, and every vibration cause I mom from here, *uhhh*, just kept going like this.\n\n \r\nIt was just vibrating, and within a minute the pain stopped.\n\n So, now anytime it comes on, I sing or just moan like that, and it goes away.\n\n Otherwise, it just gets worse and worse and worse until I can't even move, and it shoots back to that pain, right back into the center.\n\n Again, this low weight that I have is a problem.\n\n Now that the tapeworms gone, I'm starting to put on weight quicker.\n\n \r\nAnd that also means that since the tapeworm left, the head came out, so I knew it was all over and all of its parts were in the feces.\n\n A three-day period.\n\n So, I know that it's over, it's finished that heavy milk detoxification.\n\n My body is finished the major part of it.\n\n So, I do feel better in many, many ways, but, you know, I just want to caution you if you're going to do anything, don't do anything over what I suggest when the detoxification book comes out, because you may suffer a lot more than I did.\n\n \r\nSo anyway, that's what I had to say.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen's the book coming out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt'll probably be next summer.\n\n I was hoping it would come out last summer, but with all these detoxifications and my injuries, two severe accidents, you know, hasn't been easy.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Fungus Is From Anti Biotics Penicillin \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\n99% of the time when I did skin scrapings on people who had fungus in their hands, it was antibiotic related\n\n I always found tetracycline, mostly penicillin.\n\n \r\nJust discard, because that's a mold and penicillin is a mold because antibiotics are molds.\n\n So, then the body produces its own molds to help break those down to eliminate them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI noticed it after I had a manicure.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it could because that chemical that they use.\n\n In fact, three of their chemicals are pretty potent and they can cause a lot of tissue damage underneath, even to the bone and molds can work on that too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs that related to the penicillin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that would be the 1% that people are having it from cosmetic stuff?\n\n I've also seen mechanics.\n\n I don't get that many mechanics, but i've have maybe five mechanics in 30 years, and when I did scraping on the hands with their mold, it was all solvent related.\n\n In fact, we found the compounds of brake fluid were the worst.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Ground Flax Seeds Destroy Stoamch \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about putting flax seed on top of it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat will tear your intestines up , it'll act like glass.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nFlax seed in what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoffee grinder?\n\n\r\nYou're also going to have phytic acid, it's going to prevent you from digesting.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Inhaling Fiberglass \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf you inhale fiberglass\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's a terrible toxin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do you handle that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot easily, because you have to understand, it's put together with a resin?\n\n \r\nWell, formaldehyde is just one of the agents in it that they use.\n\n There's a epoxy in it, because it's a plastic basically.\n\n It's a plastic and you got phthalates, you got all kinds of toxins, and can you imagine eating plastic, that starts melting in your tissues.\n\n It's worse than cancer?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Lance Armstrong Cancer \n \n**[2004],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow do you explain Lance Armstrong because he had major cancer in his brain and other parts of his body, and he underwent chemotherapy- \r\n\n \r\nHe was one of those bodies that just was able to turn it all around and be good at it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou don't really know the details about it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, I read some about it, but it all had to do with his body not what he did?\n\n Of course, they love to flaunt him out.\n\n You know, he's the only person like that in the world, and you don't make only one person out in the world who reacts that way.\n\n You don't want to try to be like him because there's only one in 4.\n\n5 billion people.\n\n \r\nThat's not the kind of guy you want to emulate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut they advertised him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, they push him, oh yeah! Cause then the medical profession takes credit.\n\n This is the way they do it.\n\n He's the only one that survived that kind of severe treatment.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Last Time Aajonus Received Chemo \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n1968 was the last time I had any drugs\n\n Last time I had the.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n my throat started closing off.\n\n I got a terrible sore throat in about 1972 and it came to the point I resisted it, but I was a fruitarian.\n\n So, I wasn't eating the fat or the fruits that I needed to repair.\n\n\r\nSo, I just got to a point where I couldn't breathe, so the neighbor called a doctor, a friend of mine and he came over and gave me a shot of penicillin, allergic to penicillin, but it's at least it opened my throat, you know.\n\n So, I had terrible reactions for months, but I didn't die because my throat was shut down nor did I ever have to have a trachea.\n\n\r\nSo, but I didn't know a good diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, approximately 1970.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n1972 was the last time I took any kind of medication?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, from that point forward, whatever you've done lately- your diet is getting better, but it's still taking 30 years and more to process that toxicity.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Lots Of Eggs  &Butter & Honey Before Surgery \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou better suck a lot of eggs\n\n What I suggest for surgeries in the first book, eating eggs, at least 6 to 8 a day, 9 a day, 10 a day, 12 a day for nine days before the surgery, and then that after the surgery, lots and lots of eggs and honey and butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBee pollen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBee pollen can be helpful, but you're going to need that more after?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Milk In Plastic \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI currently have milk in a plastic jar, is that a problem\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, it does, and he'll claim that it doesn't, but I can taste the difference?\n\n They make the jar, the plastic container.\n\n It has a film on it that to keep it from sticking in the pressing, and maybe just a tiny bit, but he gets into the milk.\n\n It doesn't damage you or harm you, it just takes up some of the fat in the milk, so it doesn't get utilized and it changes the taste.\n\n \r\nI don't leave anything in plastic because I take my milk and cream out of the refrigerator and let them sit for a couple of days and there's a high bacteria.\n\n I'm not going to sit it sit in plastic.\n\n \r\nAs long as it's refrigerated it's not going to be big deal, but I tell everybody not to get any milk that's refrigerated cold.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThe cream that they delivered on Tuesday.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mean the cream.\n\n As long as it's been refrigerated it's going to be okay?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou can still get it from James in a glass bottle.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Mold & Viruses Form On Their Own In Sterile Environment \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI give several remedies in the book, like coat your foot with honey and wrap it overnight and that will smother it\n\n Doesn't kill it or stop it.\n\n You don't want to kill it and stop it.\n\n  \r\nThere's no way you can, because it's part- just like you have bacteria, parasite, eggs in every cell.\n\n You also have molds, it's part of nature.\n\n That's why when you let a fruit sit, you don't have to expose that fruit to a mold.\n\n It molds on its own.\n\n You can put it in a hermetically sealed environment, and that will mold.\n\n  \r\nWhen I took a lamb and we butchered it in the laboratory, everything was completely sterilized, and we had one area where there it was glass encased, medically sealed, no bacteria can get involved in it.\n\n**[plants]**\n to produce oxygen to get over into that area with two HEPA filters.\n\n So, it had to pass through, and they kept it at the sheep's body temperature, which was about 96 degrees, 96.\n\n7 96.\n\n8, and within three days, parasites developed.\n\n Where did the parasites come from.\n\n It's a natural part of every animal cell?\n\n \r\nIt's like any fruit molds, it's a natural part of fruit.\n\n, you know, fruit.\n\n One time I let fruit sit in a hermetically sealed environment like that for 20 days, flies appeared.\n\n Where the frick were the flies coming from.\n\n There were worms in the fruit cells that allowed it to come out and work on it, and those are called fruit flies?\n\n \r\nWell, it's toxicity stored in his moles.\n\n  \r\nDetoxification, absolutely, and you can mitigate it by using the primal facial body care cream.\n\n You know, when I had it, I had it all the time as I was a child and it wasn't till, I went on a raw diet, started eating raw diet that it went away.\n\n \r\nWell, last year, it came back for the first time and only in the foot where I had a bad bicycle accident in 1981, I broke seven bones in the foot.\n\n I was on a bicycle in the desert, and somebody had left there a sprinkler on all night, so it created a Moss, really slippery algae in the gutter, and I was going close to the gutter.\n\n Wheels just slid out from under me, and my toes caught on the curb and ripped.\n\n This one was ripped out to here, so it was ripped all the way down to here.\n\n This one was ripped to here and this was ripped to here and this one was just barely torn, but I'd broken two bones here and in four bones here and then one over here, and it was pretty painful.\n\n  \r\nThose were the only areas where the mole.\n\n All I did was I packed mud in it, clay.\n\n Stopped the bleeding.\n\n I had a little 14-year-old girl who'd love to go around and cracking people's knuckles, put my toes back in place.\n\n So that's how I had them adjusted.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat kind of clay did you use.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI just pulled out what was in the ground?\n\n What was it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat was the significance of getting?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nA lot of the dead tissue remained in there and sealed over and probably dirt and a lot of other things that- I should have used clay or something, but I was out in the wild.\n\n What was I going to do.\n\n So, I used what was available, and it was after I'd been out living outdoors for a long time, so I didn't have a clean clay or anything else, and I didn't take time to clean off the torn tissue or maybe move it back into place, I just packed it and put a soft coat?\n\n That's new, this toe three years was stuck out here.\n\n \r\nThen when I went through the athlete's foot.\n\n This one is still a little bent out.\n\n You see that they're ben out slightly, but before I went through that athlete's foot for a year, this toe was out here and all of a sudden that mold, that fungus went in there and cleaned out the tissues, and now it's right.\n\n The only place that's still itching is here.\n\n \r\nSo, I'm hoping that after another year that will be aligned properly too, and the athletes would be helpful to do that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou didn't have a cast on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no?\n\n Like I went walking, I went to see Caddyshack that I was in so much pain and headache.\n\n So, I walked to Caddyshack, which was about five miles the next day, I bicycled as well.\n\n \r\nYou have to get over the pain by doing something, but you don't take drugs, you got to distract yourself.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) MSM & Sulphur \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat about MSM\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMSM is a chemical?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWith the Sulphur.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, what does Sulphur do in the body?\n\n It dries it out, that's why MSM works, it destroys nerve tissues, so you lose the symptoms?\n\n \r\nNot because you're curing anything because you're drying out the nerves and they no longer have impulse.\n\n \r\nYeah, that's a chemical way to do it, but still, that remember the no enzymes are active, unless the pancreas realigns them.\n\n So, in your raw fresh food, we have enzymes that are all easily disassembled and reassorted.\n\n So, what those enzyme supplements seem to do is kick ass on the pancreas to make it work cause the pancreas has to deal with all the enzymes.\n\n \r\nSo, it isn't that it does it in a helpful way.\n\n Causes more toxicity.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Nitric Oxide \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey don't use nitric oxide anymore\n\n I remember when I was a child I had a tooth pulled out?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNitric oxide, so many people had heart attacks with it that they're afraid to us it.\n\n Some people go into comas from it, so it's more dangerous for the anesthesiologist and the other doctors involved.\n\n So they don't like to use it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Non Natural Clothing & Break Down Polymers \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou have so much cancer\n\n The cancer's going to grow from incredibly because people are wearing synthetic clothing.\n\n Plastic clothing, and when you wear polyester, any of those that aren't silk or wool or cotton, you're in trouble.\n\n Even if you have flax, or hemp.\n\n It's a problem because you've got all these resins from the vegetable oils, you're breathing those in and they are going to turn to rock if they embed in your lungs or in your sinuses somewhere.\n\n Any of those are plastic and you're going to have to have a pretty severe virus solvent to break it down and what happens with all that toxicity, where does it disperse.\n\n Everywhere in your system?\n\n  \r\nBacteria and parasites can't eat it.\n\n It's not on their diet, you will kill them instantly.\n\n So, the amount of cancer that we're going to have in like 2015, 2017 is going to be astronomical because people have synthetic carpeting and synthetic bedsheets, bed covers and clothing, everything in the household is toxic and they're breathing this lint.\n\n \r\nI mean, let the sunshine through and see how much lent is traveling around if you're taking a walk through your house on time.\n\n That lint, if it comes from your carpet or your couch or your clothes, that's how much you breathe in, in a day.\n\n Tremendous amount.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs there anything to help break it down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's a pretty difficult one?\n\n To experiment with that I would have done some pretty severe damage with animals, and I wouldn't do it, but I would suggest is probably using some olive oil to help break it down, but no more than two tablespoons a day with a meat meal, but you've got to have butter and or cream with it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Novacane \n \n**[2004]**\n \r\nNovocain is a pretty toxic drug\n\n There's somebody in here that were having facial rashes.\n\n When I did some skin scrapings on some people that were having very constant facial rashes, there was Novocain compounds in that tissue.\n\n \r\nA lot of people who have abscesses in their teeth, predominantly Novocain discharge.\n\n About 50% of the time, it was just a deteriorated nerve cells in and around the tooth that may have been caused by mercury filling cause there was mercury and a small amount of other heavy metals that were in the silver fluent, the amalgams.\n\n \r\nAnd the new one they have procaine or something like that.\n\n It's worse, I found more molecules in that than I found in Novocain.\n\n They say it's better, better for whom.\n\n The pharmaceutical company can just say anything they want just to sell a product?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Old Athletes Don't Look Well From Poor Diet \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nUh, yeah, I kind of made an observation recently\n\n I don't know, but just sort of like a partial observation.\n\n I don't know if you've observed the same thing, particularly like among older athletes, not younger athletes.\n\n I've noticed that guys that like run a lot or bicycle.\n\n They don't look so good.\n\n Like they look like they look kind of gaunt and lean.\n\n \r\nWhereas, you know, like I saw a picture of Sylvester Stallone.\n\n He's like 56 and he works out with weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHe is healthier.\n\n He eats raw eggs and raw chicken.\n\n He won't advertise it.\n\n \r\nRight before Rocky came out.\n\n He and his wife used to shop in the health food store I worked at and I substituted for a friend of mine who had to go on vacation for a heart surgery, so he was out for a couple of months.\n\n So, I worked there and Sash his wife came in, and we talked about what he ate and he was eating lots of raw eggs and chicken, lots of raw chicken.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut I just noticed guys who are like muscle builders or weightlifters, to see pictures and they do look better than runners.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour runners and your bicyclers believe they have to be really lean.\n\n So, they have no fat and got no lubrication, and their bodies are drying out inside, sort of becoming cirrhotic, multiple sclerosis.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhereas your weightlifters.\n\n They actually trying to put on weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWeightlifters have to be fat.\n\n Bodybuilders aren't fat, they're lean and cut tissue.\n\n They still have fat in the tissue, but your weightlifters, you can see they're all fat.\n\n You don't see one lean weightlifter; you've got to have fat to do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, basically the difference is not the type of exercise.\n\n It's just the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's the diet, you know, those bicyclers.\n\n I've had a few of them and runners, \"Oh I have to eat high carbs.\n\n\" \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Olive Oil Is Fruit Oil, Won't Harden \n \n**[2004],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhere does olive oil fit into this picture\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOlive oil is a fruit oil?\n\n It's a good solvent and it will not harden.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Omega - Don't Worry About It \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about the omega-3, 6, and 9's\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe just talked about that?\n\n You have concentrations of nutrients needed, but you need every nutrient, not just 3 and 6, and in a  certain ratio.\n\n You know, they come up with these wild theories because they want to be published, but nobody's done long tests to prove anything.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, oils are heated beyond what they should be.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Only Things That Are Contagious Are Skin Bound \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe only things that are really contagious are things that live on the skin or the tissue that the tissue is feeding on\n\n Like yeasts.\n\n If I had sex with a girl that had yeasts, and I have lots of cellular toxicity that is sugar bound, I'm going to have a yeast there eating it helping me detoxify.\n\n \r\nCrabs are contagious.\n\n They live on the skin.\n\n Anything- salmonella is contagious that lives on the skin, not internal salmonella.\n\n There are 2300 varieties of salmonella and most of them internally, but the way we used to shower in the old days, when we didn't take baths every day, we had all these little salmonella that went around eating up all the dead cells on the body, and there are about a hundred varieties that do that.\n\n So, when your pet lizard, your dog or cat has salmonella running around on it, that's the way nature always functions.\n\n Doesn't go around bathing, all these little creatures go around and taking care of them.\n\n \r\nIt's a symbiotic relationship, to eat up the dead cells on the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDon't you have to get the tapeworms some way, from something you eat or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat did I just say, I said that each cell contains all of the eggs for any worm, any parasite that existed that eats on human flesh?\n\n Plus, every bacteria, it's a natural innate part in a part of every cell.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Organic Pastures Feeds Cows Bad \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's why I don't like Mark feeding his cows this crappy garbage, like rice bran cause he's trying to save a buck\n\n He blames it on bacteria.\n\n That's such bullshit.\n\n I hate when people like that think that everybody is stupid.\n\n We owned a dairy.\n\n My grandparents owned a dairy, the bacteria, the sky high.\n\n Never had sour milk, unless the cows were out, and we've missed a couple of patches of thistle and they eat that thistle and that cream will sour the next day, but it wasn't sour every day.\n\n It's what you feed the cow.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, he's not just feeding them organic pasture.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, he'll feed them organic rice bran, and he did this last year and we told them, don't do that?\n\n It's got gibberellic acid in it and it can we turn the milk bitter, but he gets cheap.\n\n \r\nWell, he just stopped it again last week.\n\n So, we had to get cream last week cause he started losing money and the only way we can to hurt him is to stop buying his cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, just throw out the cream we got from him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I wasn't able to eat it?\n\n I just mixed it with water and put it in my compost.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNot buying it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n that's the best feedback.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's the best feedback, you heard his pocket, that he changes what he does?\n\n So we had to do it twice that way.\n\n James rejected his cream for four weeks.\n\n \r\nHe said it was some bacteria.\n\n Let me tel, when my grandparents produced milk, some of that *milk* was 10,000 parts bacteria per gram.\n\n We had an intense amount of bacteria, nobody ever got sick.\n\n Such garbage.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhen I started this diet, and I started drinking the milk I was getting a lot of gas problems.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, not only that, milk pulls a lot of chemicals out in body like eggs, and when those chemicals come in and mix with your digestive juices, it causes gas.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat happened was, like a week after I had the milk, I had two bottles, one was in the fridge for a while.\n\n It got actually pretty sour, but when I drank that, after that I've been perfect.\n\n No more gas, no matter what, whatever it is, whether the milk fresh or a little bit sour, no more gas.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nOrganic pastures.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I wasn't able to eat it because I'm so light right now and I'm still going through a detox.\n\n I couldn't eat it.\n\n It was causing me headaches, so I couldn't eat his cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, what do you do with it.\n\n Just throw it out?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat did I tell you?\n\n Mixed mine with water and put it in the compost?\n\n You can do whatever you want to do with it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhen they have the plastic cream bottles, are you allowed to buy those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, just take it out of the plastic when you get home?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Pain Formula & Bee Pollen \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nSometimes the lubrication formula works within 20 minutes\n\n That's because when you put the bee pollen in it, the bee pollen is a very finite protein and the bees, when they collected it, they put their saliva on it.\n\n So, it's predigested, broken down the shells, like a nut has a hard shell on it, it's why you can't dry it.\n\n\r\nCause once it's dry, the shell is hard and it's like eating a walnut.\n\n There's no way you can break that shell down and digest it, but when it's moist, then your body can utilize that protein instantly, also egg whites.\n\n That's why I use so much egg in the diet because t the egg white is all easily absorbed and digested protein, instantly.\n\n\r\nThat's why I worked for that women with emphysema who supposed to die on the weekend.\n\n She ate 66 eggs, and she was out of bed off the oxygen for the first time in two years.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Pain Is Swelling \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nJust remember any pain is swelling\n\n Pressure on the nerves.\n\n How do you relieve the pressure.\n\n You have everything around relaxed, so it can expand without ripping, without the pressure?\n\n So, applying hot water bottle or getting to a bath is going to do that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Pasteurized Dairy Bronchitis \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut I've always thought that usually people that have a lot of bronchitis and stuff, that's coming from pasteurized dairy, I would've never thought it came from cooked fruits and veggies\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you look at all of studies and the laboratory tests that they've done with milk and pasteurized milk, it's never created bronchitis, it's never one of the symptoms.\n\n\r\nThey say creates diabetes, osteoporosis, and diseases like that, it has never been attributed to bronchitis.\n\n I mean it's a myth now, a lot of alternative people make that claim, but it's come from no research.\n\n It's just, they're hypothesizing.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA lot of people experience is they eat pasteurized dairy, they start to get a lot of mucus, and they get a cold\r\n\n\r\nYes, because the body's trying to discharge the poisonous of the mucus, and it's discharging out the mucus.\n\n That's not a problem.\n\n They're getting rid of it.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, what you're saying is pasteurized dairy causes a lot of mucus, but it doesn't cause the poisons in the mucus-\r\n\n\r\nIf the mucus is taking the poisons out it's not going to cause a bronchitis.\n\n\r\n Well, it means that their body's discharging it quicker, so the body's trying to protect itself.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, if you were having a cough, you're releasing all the poisons from the pasteurized milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect, as much as possible.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe longer it lasts the more you release.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, depending upon how you break it down in the system?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there any way to describe the experiment that Owanza did where she developed that information about the different colored fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what she did was she asked the laboratory technician to see if there was a fat residue that was connected in certain tissue.\n\n So, what he had to do was use certain kinds of enzymes, which are solvents to dissolve the tissue and then separate it, so he could study it.\n\n\r\nHow exactly and what he used and all that.\n\n I didn't take notice of.\n\n When he said these were the results, and when you looked into those results, then you can see that in this kind of condition, there were a lot of the resins from the red foods, resins from the yellow foods in these different conditions.\n\n\r\nAnd that was how it was resolved and concluded.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Radiations Kills Bacteria&Parasites \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou said that the chemotherapy and radiation prevented your body from allowing bacteria to exist\n\n How long approximately does the body prevent bacteria from existing after a relatively large dose of antibiotics.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt can last for 50- it can last all your life if you don't eat properly?\n\n If you can't clean those poisons out, anytime a bacteria or a parasite goes in there to eat, it's going to be killed after a few meals.\n\n Few days, it's gone, no help.\n\n So, your body has to make a solvent, which all that toxicity is dispersed all throughout your fluids in your body, and so you get sore all over.\n\n If you're getting sore all over, viruses working.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Resin Is A Vegetable Oil \n \n**[2004]**\n\r\nResin is a fat from a tree, that's a pinyon tree, but that's a vegetable oil as well\n\n All vegetable oils are resins.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Saunas & Steambaths \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nPeople say, well, I can do that in a sauna or steam bath when you're doing a sauna or steam bath, those toxic substances stay in the tissue a lot of times\n\n So, a third of them may penetrate your skin and maybe be reabsorbed or damage your skin.\n\n So, if you're doing a sauna, you have to get out of every three minutes to rinse off.\n\n\r\nCan't stay in there long time cause they're going to cause some damage.\n\n Sure, you're going to secrete a lot of stuff, but one third of that may cause more damage as well.\n\n \r\nThat's why I like baths, it's discharged into the water, right into the water.\n\n It doesn't stay on your skin and those ingredients are in the water.\n\n It just draws it out.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat happens if you went in the water without waiting 7 to 10 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you're going to have some of that garbage in the water absorbed into your body, into your skin?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould you recommend that kind of tub you talked about with the metal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Well, it's good in that.\n\n It's still, you know, it's more electrical, so it'll stay hot longer, and for me that was necessary.\n\n Plastic, it may gas a little bit, uh, but it doesn't have the electrical field turns on.\n\n Depends on what you handle better.\n\n Can you handle the radio waves that metal draws to it, or do you handle the gases from the phthalates from the bath.\n\n\r\nThe ingredients in the bath is going to handle the phthalates better than your body's going to handle the electromagnetic energy that's absorbed.\n\n Then the water may absorb that too.\n\n So either.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Should You Force Detox On Diet \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLet the body timing unfold, different things happen at different times, but just eating the diet consistently will be the best thing\n\n I don't need to go something specific, have this combination.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you have a certain ailment, I will help you to have things that I've suggested that for those-\r\n\n\r\nFor those things, but I'm saying in general, the diet is going to allow the body time to cleanse whatever it is needs?\n\n For example, first three days, I had major metal taste in my mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if your on the diet or not because people who are not doing the diet have that same experience.\n\n However, I found that people who are not on this diet detoxify anywhere from 18 to 20% of the population is in a detoxification.\n\n On this diet it's only 8-12%.\n\n \r\nTaking all the of population out there and their detoxification 18 to 20% of the time, people on the diet are only in detoxification over the whole majority, 8 to 12% of the time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're detoxing less because the toxins move quicker.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause they're not dealing with all the toxicity that they're eating constantly?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, we're still in a period of time where we're rebuilding their bodies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n40 years.\n\n\r\nSo, it's about half of theirs, but that's because we're not poisoning ourselves with those toxins, and there are 30 toxins that we've identified I stated in the recipe book in the back pages.\n\n Those are only the ones we've identified.\n\n\r\nYour body has to deal with that much toxicity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't want to hurt myself or do something special.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, don't do anything.\n\n That's what I'd suggest.\n\n For those people who are antsy and want to push it, I'm going to suggest how to detoxify the body and cause detoxification, but like I said to everybody here, don't push it.\n\n\r\nTablespoon, an ounce.\n\n Two tablespoons a day if you're going to do it?\n\n Don't do three cups a day, kick your butt.\n\n I have no ass, you know me I had a big ass all my life, all of it away in like two weeks.\n\n My whole butt was gone.\n\n \r\nCourse that's where I got a lot of injections.\n\n\r\nSo, I'm sure I had a big butt because most of it was toxic, but I still liked that butt because the girls liked it.\n\n Now I don't have it anymore\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Skin Cancer  &Eye Healing \n \n \n \n \n### (42) Soak Clay For 5 Days \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why I say you have to soak your clay for five days before you eat it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven when you put it in the juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you put it in the juice you have to soak it before hand, you want the molds and all of that to be active?\n\n If it isn't it's going to be a little sharp on your intestines.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's okay in mineral water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut you want to shake the carbon out of it?\n\n Cause there are bacteria's in the clay that will start becoming very active after a few days in the water, you don't want them to destroy them.\n\n Carbon will destroy them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the ratio of water to clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust make it a paste?\n\n Like you do for plaster repairs before its dries.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Sour Butter Irritable & Tired \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUm, I noticed when I used the cream or butter that's kind of too sour, that it makes me really kind of irritable, I'll get tired circles in my eyes\n\n What does it do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're already having the bacteria, the bulgaricus is already breaking down the fats, predigesting them, and when you have predigested fats like that, you can do a lot of detoxification?\n\n**[bacteria]**\n, and acidophilus.\n\n It won't concentrate on one particular kind of toxicity.\n\n \r\nBut once the bulgaricus is the major bacteria that's breaking down the fats, and that's an excessive amount of a particular type of solvent that can be utilized, and the body has a tendency sometimes when it's like that, not to utilize it to build the body, but to make solvents to dissolve toxicity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Soy, Flax, & Seeds Oils Harden \n \n \n \n \n### (45) Stroke & High Blood Pressure Fish & Chicken \n \n**[2004],[Attendee],[unclear]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you know the actress from \n, well her husband just had a major stroke\n\n She's a friend of mine.\n\n I was recommended hyperbaric oxygen chambers.\n\n Are you familiar with those.\n\n I've heard that they reverse a lot of the damage of stroke?\n\n Is there anything else besides the hyperbolic chambers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThose hyperbolic chambers only work in very rare cases, and it doesn't have anything to do with the chamber?\n\n \r\nIt's just you've got that certain amount of people that reverse that condition.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDoesn't it bring oxygen into the system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour oxygen isn't what causes nerve damage?\n\n It's got nothing to do with it.\n\n Oxygen just means that you transmit and relay certain kinds of information in and out of the nervous system, because the oxygen just doesn't get into the muscles.\n\n \r\nYou don't have the ability to utilize fat as energy, whether the fat was from an acetone or a regular fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHe has high blood pressure too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, anybody who has high blood pressure, just remember anybody, who's got a body functioning in a certain way, that body's functioning because it needs to.\n\n High blood pressure is very important for anybody who's got collapsing intestines.\n\n They need that high blood pressure to keep the veins and arteries up, otherwise they'll collapse.\n\n \r\nSo, you got all these doctors giving them things that their body is trying to correct, and they just get worse and worse and worse.\n\n Everybody that has that condition is dead within seven years.\n\n No matter what age they are.\n\n It's ridiculous.\n\n \r\nThe only thing that will help that reverse that stroke damage is eating chicken and fish together with some butter and cream.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Sylvester Stallone Eats Ra WChicken \n \n \n \n \n### (47) Tapeworms Live On High Sugar Diet \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat did I just say\n\n I said that each cell contains all of the eggs for any worm, any parasite that existed that eats on human flesh?\n\n Plus, every bacteria, it's a natural innate part of every cell.\n\n  \r\nNow, when you take a tapeworm of a person who's eating just cooked and mainly old people who have tapeworms, it lives on a high sugar environment.\n\n So, when we send just sugar cereals over and grains for these third world children to eat, they all get tapeworms because that's all they're eating, and our bodies are not meant to eat that, our bodies are meant to eat animal foods and all that excessive sugar going through the system poisoning you, they get these bloated stomachs.\n\n \r\nThey need the tapeworm to help them from having all that advanced glycation end product and acrylamide toxicity.\n\n Without that tapeworm, they'd all die very quickly, probably within a year, but they can live with that tapeworm for 27 years in their body if that's the major part of what they eat is that sugar or called high-carbohydrate food.\n\n \r\nI've seen pictures of tapeworms from animals, humans that eat and other animals that eat only cooked foods, and when it shrivels and shrinks, it turns into either like a hard rice, or it turns into a shrunken flattened piece of corn.\n\n However, I saved a bit of a tapeworm to see what had happened for me, and the thing shriveled up into a thread and disappeared into an egg.\n\n That's what it does in the body.\n\n \r\nThat egg exists in every cell in the body and when your body needs it, and it only exists in the intestines, you will discharge that egg and that egg will hatch.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDoes your body do that every time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf your body has the ingenuity to utilize and do it, it will, but most people don't?\n\n I haven't I've been too toxic.\n\n \r\nI had medications all the time, all kinds of medications, and then the chemo and radiation.\n\n So, if any bacteria or parasite tried to help me, they would be poisoned to death.\n\n So, none could thrive in my body.\n\n So, I've went through all these years of no parasites, no bacteria in my body, and I was sick all the time.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut now you're getting rid of the radiation from the chemotherapy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRight.\n\n So, now finally I got to the point where I can breed a parasite, which is wonderful, and in my book, in the recipe book, I talked about Joel Weinstock.\n\n The gastroenterologist at the university of Iowa, he had these long-term patients that suffered anywhere from 10 to 30 years with inflammatory bowel syndrome.\n\n I gave a lecture about 20 years ago, Yale, and he was a part of that, and I was talking about how they are beneficial, and if we had them, we would have half the symptoms or none because they would be helping us discharge all the poisons.\n\n  \r\nSo, about 10 or 12 years ago, 11 years ago, he took the whip worm from a pig and got the eggs from it and then put it in Gatorade and gave it to six people that suffered incurable, inflammatory bowel syndrome.\n\n  \r\nFive of the six completely lost all symptoms, just like that.\n\n We're talking five days, all their symptoms, and this is a painful thing because every time you eat anything, you have instant diarrhea and pain is always painful, and if it goes into Crohn's, you have the poisons get into the joints, and cause joints to swell guys like rheumatoid arthritic condition.\n\n It is very, very painful, and these people suffered the most.\n\n These six people here were his worst clients.\n\n five of them, out of the 6 completely resolved.\n\n \r\nThey were back about five months later, knocking on the door for more because what was their body.\n\n Their body was so contaminated?\n\n They couldn't keep breeding because it was poisoning the parasites.\n\n So, they had to go back for more of them.\n\n  \r\nI tried to spike bacteria and parasites in people and animals, but was unable to do it, but I never thought of putting it in an alkaline substance like Gatorade.\n\n \r\nI could've put it in vegetable use, but I thought you don't put an animal product in a vegetable juice, but if I had done that it might have worked.\n\n I don't have a laboratory anymore, so I can't do the experiment, but that probably work because if you put it an acid solution or even water, the hydrochloric acid will dissolve the eggs and all that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Teeth Surgery  &Novacane \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs there anything that I should eat like meatball and an egg before and

in 1978.\n\n 4 hours one morning, four hours the next morning with no Novocain.\n\n \r\nWhat happens is the pain comes from when the bit gets hot.\n\n\r\nSo, I had a signal, every time that bit started getting warm.\n\n I tapped the dentist's elbow and he'd stop until that bit cooled down or he'd stick it in water and cool it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't think I'm that brave.\n\n\r\n.\n

meat has a tendency to cause over acid condition with people with arthritis\n\n Any kind of joint pain that's not associated with the bacteria doesn't seem to be affected.\n\n You've got the virus in the joints we do seem to need more red meat to do the healing.\n\n \r\nWhy that is.\n\n I don't know?\n\n That's an experimentation.\n\n I don't create the rules, I just study them.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThe more you cough, you can't have any red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd also, the pain formula, and the honey/butter formula help?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nFor the cough as long as it lasts you don't eat any red meat.\n\n Well, you said you're taking the cough as you would a cold or a flu?\n\n So, you're not supposed to eat red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI did say you're not supposed to be eating red meat, I just said there's a time you should eat mostly white meat?\n\n That doesn't mean it lasts for six months.\n\n  \r\nA cold normally lasts three to five days and the flu lasts from a day to 14 days.\n\n That's when you want to concentrate on that, but if you've got a chronic cough, that has nothing to do with a cold or a flu.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, I could eat red meat after two days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Travelling \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, what I always do is I know that I can't get butter in most places\n\n If I'm going to France I can get dairy anywhere, in any regular grocery store.\n\n I was travelling there in 1973 when I had a girlfriend.\n\n So, I would stay in Paris like three months a year, a month at a time, and I was on their case because I could get raw milk at the outdoor markets, like they have a farmer's market right there in Paris right in the streets.\n\n  \r\nDifferent parks and different locations, so I'd get all the raw milk, raw cream, and raw butter right there, and there was a company that was producing it and had it there on the market, but no health food store was carrying it.\n\n It barely had to go 50 miles up here to get the dairy.\n\n \r\nBut I got on their case and now they're carrying it everywhere, even the supermarkets are carrying it, and I haven't been to Paris in 3 years.\n\n  \r\nBut in other states I've got connections everywhere.\n\n So, in the states I can get anything I want anywhere.\n\n \r\nYou just have to have it sent to you in Texas.\n\n I don't know.\n\n Excess farmers in Texas, but I've met farmers in probably 25 states where I can get product, but in the other 25 states, it has to be sent there, but my clients already get it sent to them, so when I go there, they provide it for me.\n\n I just tell them what they want ahead of time.\n\n \r\nBut I have clients who travel like that.\n\n They just have it sent to where they're going.\n\n So, it's waiting for them when they get there.\n\n \r\nPeople who have farms they'll send it.\n\n When I go to a foreign country, I always take a half a pound of butter for every day that I'm going to be there.\n\n So, like Tuesday night I'm leaving for Asia, and I'll be gone till December 22nd, and I will take 17 pounds of butter with me.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIn your case.\n\n In your suitcase?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I'll take in my cooler, and I have a cold pack with it, and I take a quart of honey for that whole 40 some days?\n\n That's my stash because I get meat anywhere, I get eggs anywhere, you get better meat and eggs in Asia.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou have to take glass jars, and put it in your bag.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, I do?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo you let it go through the x-ray.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, when I'm going to Asia, you know what I do now, I can travel, I will be on a plane five hours?\n\n I get anywhere in the United States.\n\n So, if they don't let me get through, I have a doctor's note that says his food is his medicine, don't x-ray it all the shit, they've got really nasty leaving LA, and so they're just obnoxious.\n\n I've been in communist countries; they have more freedom.\n\n I was in China and the people talk about the freedom we have here, it's so full of shit.\n\n It's ridiculous, it pisses me off.\n\n And we cherish right here our life here.\n\n  \r\nSo anyway, when I go through China airlines usually or any of those Japanese airlines, they will take my food and they'll hand it to a guy who walks it out brings it and hands it to me on the plane.\n\n So it doesn't go through the scanner because you know, I'll be on that plane 19-20 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, when you fly domestic, they won't do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, here nobody would do it.\n\n If they don't let me do it, I will stand there and eat the raw eats in front of them, half a quart of milk, they honey, butter, and raw meat.\n\n They get so mad cause they are really paranoid Most of them are paranoid of me sucking raw eggs in front of them, really nasty.\n\n \r\nI've been threatened if I didn't leave the area, go eat somewhere else I'd be in trouble.\n\n I said you're going to arrest me for eating.\n\n Do you think a jury is going to find me guilty for eating, and I said, what's going to end up is eventually I'm going to get you in court.\n\n You will be tied up for two days in that possible, nd it's going to cost you guys a lot of money and a lot of time.\n\n \r\nSo, I'd say you think about that, and will a jury find you guilty, when I've got a doctor's note that says my food is my medication and you refuse to let me have it, and you've endangered my life.\n\n \r\nWell, they used to up until six months ago, then all of a sudden something, just a big curtain came down.\n\n The iron curtain came down.\n\n They caught as fast as I entered, and that's it.\n\n When I was in China and in Vietnam, I gave them the letter and they said, okay, they were very friendly, and they said, I had a fork in my bag, so I couldn't take that through.\n\n So, they went and found my bag and put it into my bag.\n\n  \r\nThese are the security people, they're so friendly and so nice.\n\n So, all this crap about communism is garbage.\n\n They run the same as anybody else, but they happen to be more friendly for some reason.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (52) Vaccines In Arm \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCan you walk me through taking care of whatever's going on in my shoulder\n\n I suppose it could be detoxing.\n\n I've just been like lifting really heavy things and I placed a really heavy backpack on it, but I'm not on the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, then how do you expect me to help.\n\n \r\nJust follow the diet, put a hot water bottle wherever it hurts, and use a pain formula if you're in pain?\n\n\r\nWell, let's say if you're discharging mercury from a vaccine in the arm, and those were injections in the arm and that mercury travels down your nerves, you're going to have  nerve damage.\n\n Especially if you don't eat, right, you're not going to have the proper nutrients in the body when that mercury is discharging from damaging your nerve tissue.\n\n\r\nWhen I went through it this year in this arm, and last year in this arm my whole arm turned gray from the mercury and smelled just like mercury.\n\n I've had so many injections, especially tetanus shots, and they use a lot of time thimerosal in tetanus then they do anything else and the other drugs.\n\n\r\nSo, my whole arm turned gray from it.\n\n If I hadn't been eating a good diet and been in that tub, discharging those poisons quickly out through the skin, I would have had severe nerve damage, but I didn't.\n\n After the chemotherapy, everything tingled because I was poisoned everything, I wasn't on a good diet, but I also lost all the nerve control from here all the way down.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow long do you sit in that tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends upon the person?\n\n I suggest a minimum an hour, an hour and a half.\n\n If you want to stay in all night like I used to, you can sleep and do it all night.\n\n \r\nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat causes and how you do heal athlete's foot?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAthletes foot is a fungus?\n\n That's another helper.\n\n You know how colds help deteriorate and dissolve certain things.\n\n Those particular cells are degenerated best with fungus?\n\n The yeasts go after sugar related ones, the molds go after non sugar related damage.\n\n So, that's a good thing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) What Prevents Greying Hair \n \n**[2004],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot that I'm in dire need at this minute, but what do you suggest as preventative measures for graying hair\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a difficult one because greying hair is a result of toxic metals leaving the brain?\n\n If it's in the brain, if it's in the chest, of course, wherever the heirs are turning gray, you've got heavy metals leaving and the lymph system is carrying them to the hair follicle to get rid of them by building them into the hair.\n\n If causes follicle damage it turns gray.\n\n\r\nOften it reverses.\n\n After the chemotherapy, I just had a few patches of hair.\n\n When it came back, I was grey for two years, then a reverse, and two years ago, I had a patch of gray hair, and it was there for three months and went away.\n\n Then the next year, the last year I had a huge patch here and it came and went.\n\n\r\nThe only place that it stays is right here.\n\n Right, and then he goes in and out in degrees.\n\n You know, a year ago, this was completely gray.\n\n Now it's salt and pepper again, it goes in and out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about white hairs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe ability for the follicle to use para hydroxybenzoic acid, which is a B vitamin, which controls pigmentation?\n\n When the body can no longer utilize para hydroxybenzoic acid or that you're not eating it, then your hair will turn colors if heavy metals get into the follicle.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's nothing you can do about it.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nIt's another way of detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You know I had one guy go on the diet at 51 years old.\n\n He was completely gray, and after five years on the diet his hair went red again.\n\n Some people can reverse it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Women Studied Parasitology \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've studied parasitology for years; amoeba can kill you\n\n I've seen pictures of people, their organs, their liver half as long, eaten away.\n\n I mean they eat away at your whole intestines.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's right.\n\n Just in a few people that are so toxic that it doesn't stop, and it isn't controlled, but that's very rare that it happens, but it mostly happens in third world countries where they're just fed garbage.\n\n They get no meat and their muscles, and their animal tissue is so weak that the amoeba just wants to go in there and clean them up.\n\n The people who are doing this diet don't have a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI don't know, I picked it up when I was out of the country.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou weren't eating a good diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo, I wasn't, but I almost died from it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, you almost died from it.\n\n You were very thin, very dry and very ill.\n\n So, they're going to eat what it can.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut I didn't get it until I left the country and then I can back and then I was fine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n90% of the cases who have the amoeba don't leave anywhere, don't leave their own country.\n\n So, that's another myth that they like to put out there to scare people, so that every time you go out of the country, you'll take their medications, their malaria pills, or their yellow fever vaccines, so that they can make money.\n\n \r\nIt's a business.\n\n You have to realize it's a business.\n\n I'm not saying that people don't die, people die, some children die, and that isn't the tapeworm that's done it.\n\n Isn't the amoeba that's done it, it's the toxicity in their body.\n\n The amoeba and the tapeworm we're just trying to help out, trying to reduce the symptoms.\n\n \r\nBut if somebody is so deteriorating, they're going to die.\n\n That's it.\n\n This diet doesn't save everyone.\n\n Saves 95% of the people that I know and reverses their disease.\n\n If you want to lose 5% of the dozen.\n\n \r\nBut the medical profession, they reverse almost no disease.\n\n They just make you get worse and worse till you're a cripple, you have a very poor quality of life.\n\n Some people, you know, we're talking about 5% of the people that they help have that ability to heal themselves after that kind of an assault, but it's only 5%.\n\n \r\nSo, 95% I help, 5% they help, or those survive in spite of their therapies.\n\n So, now what I say is this is a much better average than theirs.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and all the other anti-parasiticals, anti-bacterials, that's your choice.\n\n I'm not going to judge you for that.\n\n It's your life, it's your life experience, but it's certainly not my choice cause I don't like being the one I'm crawling on the floor, only able to move my head and my shoulders and my arms.\n\n  \r\nThere was no joy, and that's what they did to me.\n\n For me it would take 30 minutes to go from the couch, which was about there to the kitchen, 30 minutes to get there.\n\n I'd crawl 10 feet, pass out from exhaustion, and wait and crawl another 10 feet, and I had jars of urine and pans of feces, diarrhea and everything sitting by me.\n\n I had to sit there for sometimes three days before the volunteers came.\n\n \r\nSo, I had to live in that odor and live in that pit.\n\n I had to live that way because of the medical profession.\n\n Not going back there ever.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhen was this Aajonus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAfter the chemotherapy radiation?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Aajonus Did Cocaine \n \n**[2007],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, but the worst thing is a combination, isn't it\n\n When they combine cocaine and PCP, that's when they become suicidal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny of it's dangerous?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut cocaine by itself, you don't suicidal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot necessarily.\n\n There are people who have cocaine that makes 'em suicidal.\n\n I tried cocaine one time and I nearly killed a cop and myself, just from one time.\n\n\r\nI just had a little bit too, just a little few puffs, just as an experiment, and I got so paranoid and cold.\n\n I was just going outta my mind, out of my mind, so then I started sucking eggs and milk, like crazy, and I got out of it.\n\n That was in the early 70s.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you suggest for the children to not get on Ritalin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGo on a good diet, they just have to have the dairy?\n\n They have to have honey and butter.\n\n My son just isn't doing it, he doesn't take the time to do it.\n\n He's lazy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Scrapes Off Mold \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, don't worry about the molds\n\n On cheese, I will scrape the top off because those are mushrooms and mushrooms contain a lot of spores and we're not healthy enough to handle those, cuz we're not used to it, so it could cause a major detoxification.\n\n So, I don't mind the molds inside the cheese because that's the way cheeses are made, cheeses are made to be molded.\n\n \r\nWhen you have American cheese, they never touch mold.\n\n It's just processed milk that goes through a heat, pasteurization, and homogenization process, all chemically induced.\n\n But true cheeses were always put in caves to let the molds in the caves predigest them for us.\n\n \r\nThe reason for that was milk was they would have herds and have excess milk they didn't get to sell.\n\n So, if they ate the cheese raw, It wouldn't digest properly, it would just go through the body.\n\n Sometimes diarrhea a lot of times constipation.\n\n So, they learned that if you put the cheeses in caves and let them mold eat them, they could digest the cheese.\n\n \r\nSo, when you have mold on your cheese, like when you get 'em from the Amish, they mold fast, they get hairy fast.\n\n You just scrape off the top, so you're not getting all the spore, and then eat the cheese.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOn the bottom too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverywhere, all of it?\n\n If you look at it under a microscope, you'll see that they're mushrooms, there's spores from the mycelium that breaks down the cheese and if we were healthy, mold wouldn't be a problem, we'd be used to it, and we'd be digesting the mold.\n\n \r\nBut right now, we don't have a digestive tract that's strong enough for that.\n\n So, we'll end up with constipation or diarrhea.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Son and Crack and Bush Sr \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy son is fine, he's in jail\n\n What he does is he'll do the raw meat and the egg, he doesn't bother with getting the milk and he can now in his area.\n\n So, probably when he gets out this time, he'll go for it, but every two and a half years, he'll stop doing the proper diet.\n\n\r\nH does never does it fully.\n\n He does the raw meat and the raw eggs everyday.\n\n He does not eat the dairy or honey or the butter or anything else, any of the dairy.\n\n So, he eats the raw meat and eggs.\n\n And then all of a sudden, every two and a half years like clockwork or two years and three months, he'll stop eating that stuff, gets back into crack cocaine, and he ends up in jail every time.\n\n \r\nSo, this time they're not letting him out, they won't even let me bail him out this time.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIs that good or bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's good?\n\n He needs to sit in jail for a while and learn that he's not gonna get out so easily anymore.\n\n He's 44 years old, but otherwise he's in good health.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, the cocaine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe loves crack cocaine?\n\n See, he was put on Ritalin as a child, and about 10 years ago, a psychiatrist woman who had three doctorates on that in the psychology and psychiatry showed me a report that stated that in their analysis of people who were crack cocaine addicted, 73% to 78% had been put on Ritalin as children.\n\n So, there was a direct link between Ritalin and children and in crack cocaine.\n\n \r\nNow, think about this.\n\n The Bush family ran crack all through the eighties and nineties through the CIA.\n\n They were sponsoring all of the clandestine activity in central America against all the central American countries, that was their private CIA war.\n\n They funded it by running crack cocaine through Panama and Nicaragua and they paid for all of that, and also, Bush Senior is invested in Eli Lilly.\n\n\r\nSo, you take a look at that link.\n\n They know what they're doing.\n\n They knew they were gonna get a lot of crack cocaine addicts for a lifetime once the kids were put on Ritalin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Als \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nALS is a degenerative disease of the nerves and connective tissue\n\n It slowed down the ALS tremendously.\n\n So, I haven't been able to stop it yet fully.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow many years did it add on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne, probably 7 years?\n\n One is still going, he's probably doing it 5 years, 4.\n\n5 years.\n\n\r\nSo, they should have been dead a long time ago.\n\n One fellow came to me from Singapore when I was doing lectures in patients there, and he was so far gone.\n\n He was in a wheelchair, but he lasted another two years and they expected him to go within a month.\n\n So, it did give him another two years with his family and he was very grateful for that.\n\n\r\nNot an easy one, but I have some new ideas about it, so we can talk another time about that.\n\n \r\nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYes, it's a dental question?\n\n Is there a way to regenerate or repair dental enamel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, bone marrow, eating bone marrow, applying it to the teeth and that formula?\n\n \r\nNow, because of the radiation that I had that deteriorated the bones, I had to go many, many, many years of course, experiment with the diet.\n\n I didn't come up with this diet overnight.\n\n I started eating the raw meat in September 76, still heavy fruit, was only eating meat two, three times a week.\n\n Three meals a week of meat, two to three meals a week, and then in December of 82, I started eating meat on a daily basis, then in the late eighties I started reducing fruit and by the late nineties, I started eliminating almost all fruit that was very sweet or ripe, and so all of those changes brought about different.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Appendicitis and Fruit Caused One \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCrumbling appendix, will the diet sort of take care of that\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I've had two people who went in for surgery after appendix and the doctor found that the appendix was completely enveloped in fat, even though it burst, all the poisons were contained and if they hadn't removed it, the appendix could have healed itself and been your library again.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBeen your library.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHow many times have you been?\n\n I'd said li the appendix is a library that has everything that's ever entered your body and how the body needs to respond to it?\n\n So, let's say you get bitten by a snake or a black widow, the body will know instantly by going to the appendix, what remedy to use within 20, 30 minutes.\n\n The body is already taken care of it.\n\n \r\nIf you don't have an appendix, it could be 36 - 40 hours cause your body has to re-chemistry and evaluate it all over again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if it's crumbling, that's because of the bad diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect, but you still have to be careful on this diet to do it balanced?\n\n I know people eating a lot of fruit like that one fellow, one of the fellas I was telling you about, that had the fat wrapped around, certainly ate a lot of fat, but he ate way too much fruit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Barely Sweating Is Bad \n \n**[2008],[Roger]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell I perspire very little, is that good, bad or indifferent\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's bad?\n\n 90% of your toxins leave through the skin that's why I say take hot baths.\n\n If you don't perspire, take a 35 - 40 minute bath a day.\n\n Hot bath, 105°, perspire it out.\n\n**[Roger]**\n\r\nDoes doesn't that dry your skin out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot if you're eating the fats?\n\n**[Roger]**\n\r\nIt adversely effects my sleep.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre you having your bath too late.\n\n\r\nThat's why I say in the book, best to have it midday, or at least morning, if you have it in the evening and you start detoxing, you'll disturb your sleep, could disturb your sleep?\n\n It happens maybe 20/100, it disturbs your sleep.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Bile \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBile predigests your fat\n\n Just like hydrochloric acid breaks down protein, bile breaks down fats.\n\n So, you have about 60 varieties of bile that make 60 varieties of cholesterols.\n\n Third of them will lubricate your body, a third will cleanse and a third will give you energy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Brooen Leg What To Eat \n \n \n \n \n### (9) Cavities, Plaque From Toxins \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo me being on the perfect diet has only been maybe 9, 10 years where I haven't had to alter anything just to experiment\n\n So, about 10 years ago, all of the facial fillings that I had started throwing outward and there were big lips, edges around the sites, so what it done, my body was pushing the fillings out and filling the enamel and the tubules behind it.\n\n\r\nSo, the next time when that popped out, I got a smaller filling until the tooth was filled in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, this is for cavities that you had.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCavities that I had that had been filled in for 23 years?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt was pushing them out and regenerating the nerves.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n⁠Starting to regenerate underneath, yeah?\n\n Still have still have it going on too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is it just your diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBasically just follow your your protocol.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n I don't have a cookbook.\n\n I just wanted to clarify that, I'm not making fun of you.\n\n Many people make that mistake.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's nothing special other than the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust do it long enough and you can get clean enough?\n\n Cause you have to understand that most of the dental decay that occurs happens from the toxic metals, leaving the brain, going out the gums.\n\n The body uses calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium to chelate with those toxic metals, to try to alkalize them to an extent and prevent dental damage, dentine damage.\n\n That's plaque.\n\n\r\nBut because people eat cooked foods, those cauterized alkanalized minerals are only 10% effective in alkanalizing, those toxic metals.\n\n So, even though you've got a thick layer of plaque, the acidity eventually eats through and damages the dentine, then your body creates bacteria to get rid of the damaged dentine and tubule cells.\n\n\r\nThe bacteria does not create the decay.\n\n The cavity, the damaging metals cause it, so you need to keep your teeth cleaned at least every 5 days of plaque, so the plaque doesn't eat through to the dentine.\n\n So, once your brain is detoxed enough where it's not dumping so many heavy metals down there then your body will be able to use its minerals to regenerate the dentine and tubules better.\n\n \r\nLike I said, even though I was drinking raw milk since 1969, all the way up until now, all that raw milk and eating raw meat, it wasn't until 9 years ago, till my teeth started behaving that way, my body started behaving that way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, did you suggest against any like any kind of fillings.\n\n So, I've never had amalgams, but I had an exposed gum line, so my enamels worn down?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would use that toothpaste that I recommended and put bone marrow there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, don't go get a filling you suggest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot unless you can't stand the cold and any kind of honey on it or something like that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's okay if it stays exposed, as long as it's clean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n I'm saying with that bone marrow though, so it can seal itself cuz your bone marrow has all those stem cells in it, so it can utilize all the calcium phosphorus and magnesium right there to start regenerating the tubule.\n\n Tubule gets fixed and then the dentine will get fixed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about raw eggs.\n\n I mean the eggs we've been eating have been non-refrigerated?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've never found eggs to help regenerate teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre those stem cells in eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, there's no stem cells in there, but they're not mature there?\n\n There's stem cells in there, but they don't work.\n\n In all my laboratory experiments with people and with animals, eggs never increase the rapidity of cellular division, only raw meats and fresh unrefrigerated milk did that.\n\n\r\nEggs never did it.\n\n That's why I say in the book, it's not a mature protein.\n\n That's what I'm saying it is.\n\n I really don't know the reason, but I'm saying that's what it is.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI was just gonna follow up on that.\n\n So, if my teeth are still where they are from before, that means that the brain is still just detoxing too much, and that's the reason.\n\n It's not anything else I'm doing wrong or anything like that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n Your body's using up all those minerals to bind with the poison.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) CENTURY EGGS \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm finding like a mildew or a mold, and I don't think I've ever seen that before\n\n Did I just miss seeing that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're getting a little older, they all do that?\n\n In China, if you go to China and buy the century eggs, they're either black molds- you have bacteria that breaks it down first, and then the mold eats the bacteria, keeps breaking it down into a finite powder.\n\n \r\nSo, whenever you buy those eggs, they either all black mold or all white mold, so that's normal.\n\n That means you've got an very advanced one.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, they might be three or four, four weeks older than the other ones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr even longer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it's still okay to eat those eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Just remember the mold breaks down eggs the same way the bacteria does.\n\n So, it just predigested for you, just like acidophilus, bulgaricus, all of those breakdown different elements within foods.\n\n So, they just predigest it for you.\n\n If you understand how your digestive tract works, it won't be so unusual for you, but we live on piss and shit, period.\n\n That's what you live on.\n\n \r\nWe eat food, the hydrochloric acid and other acids break up the large particles of food, bacteria go in and feed on them.\n\n Their excrement and secretions are our food.\n\n That is the law of nature, that is the law of the digestive tract.\n\n That's the way it works.\n\n If we had to rely only on our digestive acids, your brain and nervous system would never be fed, only your muscles and glands, and they wouldn't be fed a balanced whole diet either.\n\n Cuz you don't break all of your proteins down.\n\n You don't get all 22 amino acids without having bacteria predigest it, you get about 18 and that means 5 very important, essential amino acids.\n\n It's kind of redundant important, essential.\n\n I'm just trying to stress a point, 5 important amino acids, essential acids you will not have, and will not be fed and that'll affect your mind, your thinking and your behavior, energy level, everything.\n\n So, just remember that that bacteria has to predigest everything or it has to digest it.\n\n Your acids only fractionate the food into smaller cells, then the bacteria eats those cells.\n\n\r\nTheir excrement is our food.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cows Milk Degrees 105 Max \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI put it in warm water, so that doesn't ruin the\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't harm it at all?\n\n Not unless you cook it over 105°.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n The warm water from the tap.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, just put it there, but I mean, some people put 120° water in there and put it in there for a little while, the refrigerated milk or cool milk or warm room temperature milk is gonna get too hot.\n\n\r\nYou have to kind of test it and see how long it takes for the milk to get warm, and it doesn't exceed 105° with the temperature of your tap water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause just in terms of molecular structural, obviously it's warmer, more spread out, which means it's going to be more easily digested I would assume.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbove 105°, it doesn't do that?\n\n \r\nIt would take 120° to 123° for it to start expanding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich you don't want.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely not?\n\n Cuz you cauterized your potassium and your phosphorus at 98°.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is it still okay to put it in warm water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Detox \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUnderstand that there's very few people in our civilized society that aren't going to aches and pains and psychological problems, some little things, every day, little headache here, little loss of energy, cold or a flu\n\n Everybody's experiencing some kind of detoxification every day, Every minute.\n\n some are very extreme, Some are mild and mellow.\n\n \r\nSo, a lot of people say, well, gee, when I went on your diet and all of a sudden I'm detoxifying.\n\n I say, you never had these aches and pains all in your life.\n\n You've been perfect?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, the diet, like I've been on it for a year and I think I need to see you again, just to like retune.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI suggest people come back once a year, unless you have cancer, then it's once every three to four months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause there's so many things to remember.\n\n Even in reading, it's like, then I notice, okay, well, I didn't do that.\n\n So, maybe that caused that and you know, it's like, it could be overwhelming.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's why I suggest everybody read my books, both of them every six months, at least once a year.\n\n\r\nI have people who studied under me that read them 16 times each of them and said they got out of each one of them every time, even the 16th time, as much as they got out of reading it the first time.\n\n \r\nWell, you can cause more detoxification at times, you can cause chemical imbalances, like mental imbalances that would cause you to get too cold or to experience more pain.\n\n You could do those things.\n\n \r\nAnd you can go off psychologically by eating a lot of fruit without fat and you can cause all kinds of reactions by not doing it properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCould you help me realign if I saw you again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n Just give me a call between 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM.\n\n\r\nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, I'm gonna be 69 years, So my concern is reversing the aging process, and I think this diet is like a fountain of youth?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it's incredible.\n\n I'm gonna be 62 soon.\n\n I'm healthier now than I ever was as a child.\n\n Of course, I was never healthy as a child, and I get healthier every day.\n\n Every day gets easier and better.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, I was wondering if there's any emphasis on the diet for somebody that's older, keeping the hormones up and that sort of thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour bone marrow is the best way to advance it really backwards quickly.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI never did that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nApply it and eat it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIf you're on the weight loss, you can't eat it then.\n\n It's not recommended?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's okay on a weight loss to eat bone marrow, but you just don't want to eat it with meat?\n\n Your bone marrow would be your meat meal, your golf ball of meat would be that bone marrow.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Detoxing Form Smoking \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy question is about detoxing from smoking\n\n For example, what's the best thing for your lungs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n9/10 people who go on this diet automatically stop smoking, just like that?\n\n No problem with it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I've quit smoking, but to clean it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo clean it out.\n\n You get green tobacco, you juice it, you ferment it with a little bit of vinegar and lemon juice for about 10 days out of the refrigerator, and then you take 2,3 drops in one of your vegetable juices a day?\n\n\r\nIt's very potent and will start breaking down the tars in your body, and you don't want any more than that.\n\n You might only do it 5 days a week too, cuz I've seen some people go into pretty nasty detoxifications with it.\n\n But it takes a similar tar with the alcohol to attach and help break down that tar.\n\n\r\nCuz you any tar has bacteria.\n\n Any food has a bacteria, some mold better than others, rather than bacteria degenerate, but all of 'em have bacterial breakdown.\n\n So, when you have the raw, and you put that into your body.\n\n You're giving the body those bacteria to propagate, to start breaking down and fungus to start breaking down those old tars in the body.\n\n\r\nAnd remember, those smoke tars are just as thick when they go into your lungs, as they are the tar on your roof in the street.\n\n So, when your body makes cells with them, it hardens, crystallizes.\n\n So, it causes hardening of their arteries.\n\n It can cause sclera wherever it is is in your body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe pollution that we're breathing, does that cause the plaque too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a lot of other chemicals, but it does have fats and oils, especially if you're gonna use biodiesel?\n\n Hello.\n\n Biodiesel is worse than regular gasoline diesel?\n\n Because you're getting tars that're gonna crystallize in your system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's what they use in Europe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know.\n\n So, people are gonna have a different sclerosis all over their bodies.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes that apply to the tar that you get from weed as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Yeah.\n\n Not as bad though.\n\n Corn is worse cuz it's higher in fat.\n\n Weed is lower in fat.\n\n**[He's talking about actual weeds here, not marijuana btw]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Diet Plan, Red Meat Vs White Meat, Anxiety and Depression \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, this is a terrifying diet\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSome sushi and sashimi, so it's pretty amazing, but as a transition from 100% fast food, I went to a homeopathic doctor and they put me on a blood type diet that helped a lot.\n\n What do you suggest is the next step to transition.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGo to page 40 and 41 of the recipe book and choose one of those that fits you, and choose the right meat?\n\n Are you a highly active person.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI need to be?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then you should keep the red meat down and eat mostly white meat.\n\n Now, white is a category, not a color.\n\n So, red tuna, red fish; those are all in the white category.\n\n \r\nJust remember that red meat is highly acidic and it stimulates adrenaline, testosterone, estrogen, all of those physical action hormones.\n\n \r\nAnd if you don't exercise and utilize those in energy, you're going to use them in anxiety.\n\n So anxiety, you're not exercising enough and/or you're eating too much red meat.\n\n\r\nDepression, you don't have enough E coli, eat shit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEat shit?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nGet your E coli up.\n\n I do.\n\n I have people who eat E coli, eat fecal matter to get the E coli.\n\n Take the bowel of a cow, and that E coli doesn't matter.\n\n When's broken down that far, doesn't matter.\n\n It's acidic, even in an herbivore, the bowel is acidic.\n\n So, you just take a sausage section, farmers will make it that way, you take a slice of the fecal matter, and the intestines you eat those, like two ounces every three or four days to get your E coli built up.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoes high meat do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHigh meat can do that, but high meat doesn't really encourage E coli to build rapidly because by the time it gets down there, 19 hours the food moves into the bowel, about 19 hours?\n\n By that time, everything, and all that bacteria is eaten and digested, can help a little bit, but not a lot.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Dont Chew Too Much and Bacteira In Mouth \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOf course, if you keep it in your mouth a little bit, you're gonna get a lot of bacteria\n\n We have 2300 bacteria in the mouth.\n\n We've got more bacteria than dogs and cats in the mouth, so don't get bit by a human.\n\n \r\nChewing is not the greatest thing to get too much saliva with meat, but milk and any of those others, it's better to get lots of bacteria.\n\n Oh.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy isn't it good to get too much saliva with meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, depends upon the individual?\n\n We all have tylin enzyme.\n\n Tylin enzyme is very strong in the horse and in humans and the horse also developed it when we started feeding them grain.\n\n\r\nThe humans developed it when we started eating grain 10,000 years ago.\n\n \r\nIt's an alkaline enzyme.\n\n So, if we have too much Tylenol enzyme, it can neutralize some of the acids.\n\n 2, 3, 4 chews, that's all.\n\n People who chew it 100 times, they're not gonna digest much, even though they've done all that chewing.\n\n\r\nJust remember, your hydrochloric acid breaks everything up and dissolves it.\n\n It's an acid that goes and dissolves and breaks it up, so your bacteria in your intestines can eat it.\n\n And of course, if you enter some of that bacteria, saliva's full of it.\n\n So, you know, 2, 3, 4, 5 chews, and you've got a lot of bacteria in your meat already.\n\n\r\nYou continue to chew it, and then the Tylenol starts to Mount up.\n\n\r\nProbably when you're very healthy, after 30 years on the diet, it won't.\n\n But right now, our body's used to eating carbohydrates and we chew carbohydrates more than anything else, unless it's bread, something soft or pasta or something like that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Drug Addiciton \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt depends upon what it is\n\n Some people have a reaction to alcohol, which causes them to need more alcohol to break down particular fats.\n\n People who eat a lot of vegetable oils and olive oil have a tendency to need more alcohol, and if they can't get it in their diet, they'll do it in their beverage.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat if you're on cocaine, heroin, something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat happens when you take drugs, no matter what kind they are, your body will control them with adrenaline, testosterone, estrogen, dioxin, any of the endocrine glands, because all endocrine glands hormones are 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbohydrate just like the coconut?\n\n\r\nSome of them are all the way down to 60% fat, 20% - 30% protein and a higher level of carbohydrate, but none of them are under 60% fat.\n\n So, what happens is, the body produces hormones to bind with those toxins, people get high.\n\n Plus the chemical can cause a high at the same.\n\n What happens is they bind with that and will store them in the glands, keep collecting some of that chemicals and store it in the glands or other tissue.\n\n\r\nWhen you stop taking it, your body goes all of a sudden into a heavy detoxification, all that chemical that's been loosely stored.\n\n So, it causes an opposite reaction, a drastic react.\n\n And those are the DTS or withdrawal, whatever you want to call them, no matter what drug it is, that's what the pharmaceutical house counts on.\n\n\r\nYou're having a problem with, and you say, \"God, I gotta take this medicine.\n\n I'm going crazy\".\n\n Cuz the body is going crazy temporarily cuz of the severe chemical imbalance, you just have to get through that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you eat cheeses or anything like that, it won't make any difference.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it definitely will?\n\n You just consume cheese every 20 minutes you're going through a withdrawal, consume cheese, just a little sugar cube size amount every 20 minutes.\n\n Make sure you're drink sipping on raw cream all day long and eat some honey.\n\n Honey will usually stimulate the body to detox drug chemicals rapidly, so you have to have very small amounts of honey.\n\n What you could do is mix honey and butter together to help soothe your tissues, rather than having honey alone.\n\n\r\nSo, it would be cheese, honey and butter and lots of raw cream sipped throughout the day, and of course some protein, meat.\n\n Fish would always be best, don't eat red meat if you're going through any kind of withdrawal, cuz it could put you into violent behavior because of the high acidity.\n\n Remember all those chemicals are highly acidic already.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Eating During The Night \n \n \n \n \n### (18) First Add, Lime Juice On Ope Nwound \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm actually gonna ask about first aid, I happen to have a cut like this and I've been putting the cream on, but it just doesn't go away\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou gotta put lime juice on it first.\n\n \r\nLime juice, coconut cream, and honey.\n\n\r\nAlways put the lime juice on an open wound.\n\n I don't care if it's just one layer abrasion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, carry lime.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou should carry lime with you?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI work with kids anyway, so I'm getting cuts all the time, and I fix things, equipment.\n\n  And then just keep doing that.\n\n It should go away pretty quick.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n If you get your hands in water, you should do it after you get them out of water.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Fish Oil Supplements \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey are promoting new fish oil\n\n They're saying it's extracted differently.\n\n Molecular distillation they call it, different from chemical.\n\n It's arctic cod oil.\n\n I was wondering if it was different.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven if you have EMS eat at it there's certain FDA regulations for fish oil?\n\n\r\nWould you soak your peaches or your fish in kerosene for 29 minutes and then wash it off.\n\n Would you eat it.\n\n Do you think that that kerosene's gonna etch its way deep into that peach or that fish?\n\n Absolutely?\n\n Kerosene is natural so they can say, \"Oh, we process it naturally\".\n\n\r\nWell, what does that mean.\n\n Yeah, kerosene's natural, but it's also a poison?\n\n So is wood alcohol.\n\n So, those are the two things they use: kerosene derivative and wood alcohol, or wood alcohol derivative.\n\n \r\nAnything that's processed like that has to be clean by FDA standards is not really organic, and it's not a good thing.\n\n Back in all through the seventies and sixties, if you got fish oil back, It was only pressed and fermented like they do with coconut to separate it with no heat.\n\n So, it was like 82° is the highest the fish oil I ever got.\n\n \r\nIt was sticky, it was smelly, it had proteins in it, it was gunky looking.\n\n It was mucusy looking with all this white film in it, but now the FDA requires it to be crystal clean and clear of all proteins, and to do that it takes chemical process.\n\n \r\nThey say, \"Oh, we can do it centrifugally\".\n\n You cannot separate the proteins centrifugally, it's impossible.\n\n You have to have a solvent to do it, and it's either a kerosene derivative or wood alcohol derivative.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat goes for cod liver oil as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right, all of it?\n\n You get your oils from fish and you'll assimilate them better anyway.\n\n Because you have to understand, just like in coconut; coconut cream is better to eat than coconut oil cuz your coconut oil only has your water soluble vitamins and enzymes.\n\n Your coconut and fish have all of the water soluble fats, which is almost 70% of the fat.\n\n Well, if you're talking about 70% of the food itself.\n\n Coconut is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate, so the fat ratio in a coconut is 6% - 9%.\n\n\r\nTo get the coconut oil, you have to juice the coconut meat, you have to let it ferment to separate it or use the centrifugal process to let the oil separate from the water soluble fat, and those are not balanced.\n\n That's not a balanced diet.\n\n\r\nCoconut cream is the best thing to eat, not coconut oil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about that fermented cod liver oil thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey have to clean the protein out of it?\n\n \r\nYou have to use a chemical and these people will lie to you.\n\n Why.\n\n Because the chemistry lab is lying to them?\n\n They go and say, \"We've got this krill oil.\n\n We've got cod oil.\n\n We want you to make it naturally\".\n\n And chemistry lab wants the businesses.\n\n \"Oh, we can do that naturally\".\n\n But obviously the guy, unless he's a chemist at the production house that wants the vitamin or supplement or oil made for him, if he's not a chemist, he doesn't know that kerosene or wood alcohol is used.\n\n He doesn't have a clue, so they can lie to you all day and they'll be sincere, and they'll be honest, cuz somebody's lied to them.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI've been using a raw cod liver oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo such thing.\n\n You've been told it's raw, but it isn't.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, it's a newer product, I'm told it's raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFrom green pastures.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n It's not, they use oils in it, processed oils in it as preservatives.\n\n Now, 3 years ago, I worked with them for a whole year to get \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Get Off Psychotropic Drugs \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo get off my medication and I've eaten only raw the last two years\n\n In the last three months after finding your books, I've been eating raw meat, raw fish, etc.\n\n It's really helped me with social anxiety and everything just in that short amount of time.\n\n**[unclear]**\n before I had a nervous breakdown and I mean, I think it was my adrenaline gland going.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to understand, when you take any of those psychotropic drugs, there is an element purposely that they put in it for you to have withdrawal symptoms cause they want you to stay on them.\n\n In laboratory animals, it causes murder.\n\n They go around killing each other.\n\n \r\nAll of those high school killings, all of those kids had stop taking their meds anywhere from 7 to 12 days takes and it causes violent, antisocial behavior.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to understand that when you go off of those, you have to just take a chip every few days, just take a chip of it just to keep you from detoxifying it all at once.\n\n Just take a little chip.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd I mean, you've seen people who eat raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCompletely off?\n\n I have one woman who was taking 27 psychotropic pills a day for 18 years.\n\n She went on Ripley's Believe it or not with me to show that eating the high meat makes you happy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Gettinf Of Fpain Drugs, Chelators, Vingar \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRegarding the chemotherapy induced neuropathy in my toes and I was taking fentanyl citrate as a pain medicine for that, and I started getting off of it 6 weeks ago, I was taking 1600 micrograms, 8 times a day\n\n So quite a bit.\n\n\r\nNow I'm taking 400 micrograms, 7 times a day, and I did that in about six weeks, in the past two weeks I can't seem to get lower than that, trying of detox from it.\n\n And  it's been hell, I'm someone that's mentally really strong, and the three times that I was wasting and was on my deathbed three times, never been depressed more than a day, very optimistic and this stuff to made me, literally the past 6 weeks, I wanted to walk off a cliff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCannot take that stuff.\n\n Vinegar has the same amino acids that you use for chelation, only non-chemical, they're not isolated.\n\n Vinegar is your chelator for anything.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's wrong with that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat's wrong with what?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA chelator?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose chelators are metallic minerals.\n\n\r\nThey are chemical composites and they will cause more damage, unless you're taking an enormous amount of fats with them.\n\n You are going to store 80% of those things you're breaking out, and you're only going to extract them from the soft tissue and those that are fluid.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, you're not recommending vinegar though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I'm recommending vinegar.\n\n I'm talking about the chelation EDTA and those.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOh, I see.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe neuropathy, what I realized with the pain is it's not like normal pain.\n\n The only way I can frame it is when you're gonna have an orgasm, those 6 or 7 seconds before you actually have the climax.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHigh acidity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's what I have constantly.\n\n So, then I'm just exhausted and I have to take the pain medicine, otherwise I'm just.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a burn.\n\n High electrical burn cuz it's attracting all kinds of electrical charges.\n\n\r\nAll that metal in there, chemotherapy is a metallic poison.\n\n\r\nThere are poisons.\n\n You don't have any poison, whether it's rat poison, chemotherapy, no matter what it is, you've got metallic poisons in there.\n\n Thallium, mercury, lead; all of these combinations with amino acids.\n\n There are poisons, they just don't want to kill you completely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Heart Attack \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs that a detox\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what you did was you thinned the blood from a clot?\n\n Usually a heart attack is when you get too much acidity or some compound in the blood that causes a charley horse in the heart.\n\n Charley horse in the leg, you get a charley horse in the leg, the more you fight it, the worse it gets.\n\n \r\nHeart attack is the same way: you have to completely relax, you have to breathe slowly, inhale and exhale slowly and not too deeply.\n\n If you've inhale too deeply, you're gonna cause the cramp to get worse, and it's a matter of just staying focused, do not breathe fast and panic, and that's where you have your tension remain, and then you're likely to black out.\n\n And if you black out, if you don't black out soon enough, your body isn't gonna relax, it's gonna stay in that tightness.\n\n And as that uric acid builds up in that area, it will maintain the charley horse.\n\n \r\nSo, you need to relax right away.\n\n You sit down, lie down and you start very slowly breathing.\n\n You breathe as deeply until you feel it tighten, and then you just exhale again slowly and you'll come out of it.\n\n\r\nI've had 300 heart attacks from 15.\n\n5 to 20.\n\n I got diabetes, and angina pectoris after my third polio vaccine.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou knew what to do then at that moment at 15.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was autistic?\n\n I always let my body do what it was going to do.\n\n So, I just went limp when I had pain cuz I knew that if you resist and fight pain, it gets worse.\n\n\r\nSo, I just totally went limp and just moved away from the pain and breathed slowly, so I never died.\n\n I had 50 blackouts out of 300, but never died with any of em.\n\n\r\nAnd the doctors all said told my parents it was in my head.\n\n I'm an idiot, autistic idiot, in my head creating heart attacks.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Hernia \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, you might have to have surgery\n\n The only thing I've never tried with a hernia.\n\n Hernia's close to the skin, so it might react very well is putting bone marrow there.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to understand in every autopsy that I've done on a herniated tissue, there are metals from vaccines that are in that tissue and never allow it to heal and seal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat is a hernia.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTissue that rips and never heals?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThey don't put a shot in the hernia.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou get a shot, the poisons go to that area where you have a membrane that can herniate?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, not everybody it goes there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNoo, it doesn't.\n\n *exaggerated*\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) High Meat For Depression \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, eat high meat\n\n Just remember that if you've got depression, if you've got a psychological problem, your E coli is low or being destroyed.\n\n E coli is the final stage of digestion.\n\n Like I said, it digests the fats and the proteins to the finite molecular structure to feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n\r\nIf you have a psychological problem, 90% of the time it's because you don't have good E coli.\n\n You can eat high meat like I said earlier, which predigests the meat the same way your E coli does.\n\n So, when you eat the high meat, 10 to 20 minutes later, you're giggling, you're happy, you're high; because the brain and nervous system get fed like that, within 20 minutes.\n\n\r\nNow I've had over 2000 people experiment and do it, and only 1 said it didn't affect him one way or the other.\n\n He wasn't depressed anyway, so who cares.\n\n\r\nBut this woman and another fellow who had a lot of psychological problems and the woman was taking all those psychotropic drugs 27, a day.\n\n So, she was completely off of them and she had done the diet on and off for almost two years and it was like a roller coaster with her.\n\n So I said, you've got to take the high meat, you've got to try it once.\n\n If you can't do it, if you have a problem with it, I'll keep on with you the hard road, but you need to try this just for my gratification.\n\n\r\nYou need to help yourself, as well as me.\n\n So, she finally did it and just that quickly in one night she was a different.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut she probably has to continue to eat it, doesn't she.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well, she had to do it pretty strictly for about two years, a year and a half.\n\n\r\nNow she changes.\n\n She still has some psychological problems, but doesn't have to medicate for it and she does the diet maybe 60% now.\n\n Wouldn't be enough for me, I'm not satisfied.\n\n I don't want any psychological problems.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Honey Isnt High Carb \n \n \n \n \n### (26) How To Correct Speech \n \n**[2008]**\n\r\n[This is a funny article\n\n Aajonus thought he meant a speech diction, but Fred meant drug addiction]\r\n[Fred\r\nWhat's like what causes addiction.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWatch your language?\n\n**[Attendees],[Fred]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nAnd what would you do diet wise.\n\n Would you do anything special for an addict other than the raw diet?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou mean like Tourettes syndrome, you have that problem?\n\n You asshole?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nDiction.\n\n I had a Tennessee accent, plus when they gave me braces, my teeth were all crooked and everything and buked, and they gave me braces at 15 years old and took out 4 major teeth.\n\n They shrunk my mouth up, my tongue was too big, so I've got a big fat tongue and it restricted my tongue movement, so I lisped after I got my braces off, even while I had my braces on I lisped, but they said once the brace came off, I wouldn't list anymore.\n\n So, I lisped.\n\n So, this is just part of that story.\n\n \r\nAnd so you got a membrane here and you see I don't have one cuz after five years of lisping, I took a scissors and I clipped that tongue and it bled for a little while, but my tongue was able to move properly again, I lost the lisp.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Shocked*\r\n\n\r\nBut anyway, I still had a Southern accent cuz I spent from 3 - 7 years old in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and my mother's family, all 13 of those children with 200 offspring all were from Alabama.\n\n So big, heavy accent.\n\n\r\nSo, I was very sick in Los Angeles.\n\n Couldn't work as a computer analyst anymore, a program analyst anymore, so I started working as an actor by a fluke and they said that I would have to lose my accent, back then they were more prejudiced, 1969 when I started.\n\n So, I got a diction teacher.\n\n I don't know if some of you may know her Lurene Tuttle.\n\n\r\nShe was a nurse on Julia and she was an old radio star, but she was like my second grandmother, very dear person.\n\n She gave me one exercise and got rid of it in 10 days, my accent, my diction.\n\n She says, 'All you have to do is say 5 minutes at a time, 4 to 5 times a day, P P P T T T K K K, in that order.\n\n You say each one 3 or 4 times, and you keep saying that for a full five minutes and your accents will be gone and sure enough.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAny accent.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny accent, any accent?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich order.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n P, T, K?\n\n You have to repeat each one, many times over a 5 minute period with 3 P P P T T T K K K.\n\n\r\nIf you wanna say P P P P T T T T K K k k, you can do that too.\n\n 3 to 4 repetitions at a time, as many within that five minutes.\n\n So, that takes care of your diction.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nPardon my addiction, but the question was what causes addiction.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendees]**\n\r\nOh, addiction!\r\n\n\r\n*Laughs intensely*\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (27) How To Make Meth \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's like crystal meth\n\n You know how you make crystal meth.\n\n You take 3 kinds of detergents and about 5 other chemicals and it's all chemicals and you mix them together?\n\n \r\nOne of my patients had been on crystal meth for about 6 years.\n\n Her vagina was like leather, there was no mucus production, anything, all the way up into her cervix.\n\n Dry as leather.\n\n That's how nasty that stuff is.\n\n She was 23 years old, she started on it when she was about 13, 14 or 15, and she looked 40.\n\n\r\nDo you think I could help her.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, food could.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nBut it's a very slow process.\n\n It's gonna be years for her to turn around, to even be slightly normal.\n\n Probably 15 years.\n\n Cause you have to understand, the body has to clean out all those chemicals and they're all chemicals, harsh chemicals.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) How To Remove Bruises \n \n \n \n \n### (29) Kefir and Shipping Milk Degrees \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt will reach a point where it turns into cheese and separates so much that that won't happen\n\n In cows milk, I've never done it with goats milk, but when I get cows milk unrefrigerated, I keep the house or that area, the room that I keep the milk in at 72°.\n\n And it just sits there.\n\n\r\nIf I put a little honey in it, It'll start fermenting a little faster and it'll come into kefir in about 5 - 6 days.\n\n If I put, let's say a whole tablespoon in a gallon of milk, it will ferment in 3 days and it'll kefir, but that's too fast.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut that kefir for 5- 6  days, if it's never refrigerated.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt will still help regenerate cells?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShould I turn down this goats milk or should I take it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't have any fat on you, very little?\n\n So, I would recommend that you have some of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I get two gallons, that too much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, how much cows milk are you going to drink?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAbout two gallons a week ?\n\nThis would probably repeat replace my cows, I'd probably drink one gallon of cows milk and one gallon goats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that would actually help the cellular regeneration.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if I got Amos to ship me unrefrigerated cows milk from Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n Well, it takes two days to ship, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it might hit under 72°?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it will definitely in this time of year go under?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut what about summer when it would go way over 72°.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it won't because when they ship something like that, it goes into a truck that's refrigerated, cooled air, conditioned?\n\n\r\nThey cannot take a chance on electronics getting damaged with heat.\n\n So, they have to keep the trucks air conditioned at the most 75°, 76°.\n\n Tthey cannot let the packages exceed that cuz they could be held responsible for electrical damage.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying I could actually get it shipped from Amos.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right?\n\n\r\nThe only problem would be in the planes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut he sends it FedEx ground.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen it would never be harmed.\n\n It would be okay.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Light Flashes Detoxing Metalic Mienrals \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI want to know about in your eyes, sometimes you have those light flashes that go at night\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI do.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou said me! Some people have flashes.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat is good for- they do go away when you eat this way, but then another one could come.\n\n So, then I had the problem that one was almost gone and another one came on this side.\n\n \r\nSo what causes that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMetallic minerals detoxing from the brain out the tear ducts and they get sidetracked and get into the eye instead of out the tear ducts?\n\n\r\nSo, metallic minerals will reflect light.\n\n They crystallize, come into a crystal.\n\n And then if the light passes into the eye just in the right way or the right fashion and it catches the facet, then it will reflect.\n\n The light has to hit it perfectly to do that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's the remedy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVinegar helps break that down the best?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan I put it in my green juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can have vinegar in your green juice to do it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's another way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's no other way?\n\n I mean, there are other ways, but they'll cause harm, salt can do it, but then salt causes dehydration and damage.\n\n It fractionate nutrients that the the cells eat as well as any kind of crystal build up.\n\n\r\nSo vinegar's vinegars, not the only thing that will do it.\n\n I mean, beet juice, but all these other things.\n\n Red beet, not the white beet, but the red beet; can help fractionate those clusters.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Lime Vs Lemon For Wounds \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nInstead of lime juice for open wound, can you use lemon juice\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Lemon is a bacterial encourager, promoter.\n\n It encourages bacterial breakdown, that's why it's a great food to marinate meats.\n\n Lime juice is completely antibacterial, antiseptic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan you use the peel as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPeel won't work?\n\n It's too much of oil, it's a very stringent oil.\n\n Talk about burning without stopping.\n\n Squeeze that on.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Lsd Is Not Harmful \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly when you take it in combination with other things\n\n\r\nTo try to get rid of my autism in 1967, my uncle who was going for his doctorate at UCLA in psychology, they were experimenting with LSD in the laboratory.\n\n I was one of the guinea pigs, I was totally immune to it.\n\n\r\nThey gave me 720 micrograms in 14 hours, and it didn't even do anything to me.\n\n And I was not part of the control group that got the placebo, I actually got the real stuff.\n\n I was just immune to it, but I never known anybody to have a problem with LSD on its own.\n\n It's when you take it in combination with other things.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, PCP is a trigger isn't it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPCP is all chemical?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Maosquito Bites \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI get a lot of cuts and scrapes\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the bites, same thing.\n\n The lime?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't get bitten, but the limes, yes.\n\n \r\nYou know, that baby that I told you about that was anemic.\n\n He had bruises this big from one mosquito bite and he had 'em all up his leg.\n\n So, once he got the raw milk, no more bites.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhy.\n\n You think the mosquitoes would go after a more healthier body?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they go after high sugar bodies, so I don't eat sugar - that's why I don't eat a lot of fruit when I'm in a tropical environment?\n\n \r\nAsians eat all this rice and all that carbohydrate and then eat all the food on top of it.\n\n So, they get bitten like crazy.\n\n I slept on the beach in Mati and all of the people who went with me stayed in the RV.\n\n I slept naked on the beach.\n\n Mosquitoes were all around, buzzing me all night, but didn't bite me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I put the face cream on and I went to a spa and they had gnats and the gnats were all over me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey like the cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I stopped using that.\n\n\r\nBecause we use natural products that they want.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPut a little lime juice in it or some ginger, something like that, and then they won't like it.\n\n Okay.\n\n Then it will be too strong for them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Marijuana Detox \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou talked about marijuana detoxification\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nGreen juice tobacco.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou juice the raw tobacco, and then you ferment it with, let's say you have 8 ounces of juice, marijuana juice.\n\n You put like 2 drops of vinegar and about 4 drops of lemon juice and you let it sit outside the refrigerator, not near the refrigerators EMF field.\n\n You need to put it where there's no EMF field and let it ferment for about 10 days.\n\n When it starts gassing, put it in the refrigerator.\n\n \r\n2 drops of raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar\r\n3 -4 drops of lemon juice.\n\n\r\n\r\nThat's all it will take to ferment about 6 - 8 ounces of tobacco you're saying use.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you can do the same thing with marijuana.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm calling marijuana tobacco too?\n\n The same.\n\n They're two juices.\n\n It's either marijuana juice or tobacco.\n\n Same.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Meat Types For Children \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMore honey and butter, but not with the meat\n\n So, just have less with the meat, but honey and butter frequently.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat I'm doing too is like with my grandson, I'm making his bottle with chicken.\n\n Is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nChicken and milk?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMm-hmm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about fish and milk.\n\n Not red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBeef and milk too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, a lot of my infants, like I say in the book, it is half milk and half Buffalo liver or live with a tiny bit of honey?\n\n I got one kid that's five years old and just entered the fourth grade.\n\n Well, not just, last year entered the fourth grade.\n\n So, take a look at that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut also with beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's liver?\n\n I've never done it with just beef cause it's too much muscularly oriented.\n\n So, the beef liver, yes or Buffalo liver.\n\n But any of those will work.\n\n If he's a really mellow child without a lot of energy, you might wanna try some red meat, liver.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe's not mellow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you don't want to give him red meat.\n\n Keep with the chicken and fish.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Meditation \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnother thing\n\n If you're an expert in biochemical processes in our bodies, do you take into consideration other metaphysical stuff like chakra system and bio-power and other things that contributes to the healing as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf a person does yoga, it usually resolves all of that?\n\n If you're eating a good diet and doing yoga, usually your body stays stretched.\n\n Usually it's a flow to those centers.\n\n \r\nI have a lot of people who are in different modes of meditation and they can't reach those, and they've tried for years and decades to reach those states.\n\n And when they give the right foods to the body, the body is the temple of everything, the soul.\n\n\r\nSo, once you take care of that, then all the other states become very easy, very fast.\n\n I have a lot of Scientologists who go through what is called auditing and they have to go through a metabolism test first.\n\n If they don't show good metabolism, they're not gonna retain and utilize the exercises to advance them spiritually and psychologically.\n\n \r\nAnd I had one fellow who tried to get audited for seven years and he was unable to pass the metabolism test.\n\n Three months on the diet, passed the test.\n\n \r\nThis adds to the bodys normal communication, so everybody who is spiritual, who is religious, who is of another consciousness, trying to reach another state of consciousness, find it very easy on this diet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Metnal Focus, Fish, Chicken, Eggs \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI was just wondering what you would say are the most important nutritional factors for mental focus and maintaining a good mental wellbeing\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRaw eggs and raw fish and raw chicken.\n\n\r\nThose are what I used to keep on, and in a pinch an egg will do it.\n\n But I could eat eggs all day long and without eating any fish or, or beef or any kind of flesh food, and then I would find that I still had more difficulty recalling.\n\n \r\nJust remember, I was autistic.\n\n My short term memory was like this, took me 8 years of hearing things over and over again to be able to start mimicking them, and then I didn't do it well.\n\n \r\nI was probably 10 years old before I was able to mimic well, and then I mimic what was around me.\n\n Shut up, sit down your an idiot, you're stupid.\n\n So, I'd take that to the other kids and teachers in class, and of course I was always being disciplined cuz I was a smart ass.\n\n Who knew.\n\n\r\nSo, those particular foods are the most important for clarity?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Milk and Honey With Meat Meal \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat I'm doing is I'm mixing honey and butter with my groundmeat and I'm eating really sweet\n\n I like it that way.\n\n I like sweet stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHow much honey are you using per meat meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMm, well maybe I put like two spoons of butter and two spoons of honey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nToo much.\n\n If you have over a tablespoon of honey with a meat meal, it's alkalinizing?\n\n It's gonna neutralize your hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, you can't have more than a tablespoon of honey with a meat meat, and that's a level tablespoon, not a heaping.\n\n We're talking about a regularly measuring tablespoon.\n\n \r\nA measuring tablespoon is larger than a regular serving spoon.\n\n Serving spoon is usually one and a half teaspoons, which is a half a tablespoon.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have meat and milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMilk will also alkalinize.\n\n You can't have more than a half a cup of milk with a meat meal.\n\n Milk is alkalinizing as far as the relationship of calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and potassium to anything else.\n\n So, it will neutralize some of the hydrochloric acid.\n\n \r\nIf you have a highly acidic system, go ahead and have a cup of milk with it.\n\n If you have acid reflux, if you have trouble with over acidity, then a little bit more honey, a little bit more milk is fine.\n\n If you don't, you're going to spoil your digestion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long should you wait after the meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wait, because of my hydrochloride acid problem, I wait a good hour before I'll drink a whole cup of milk?\n\n I may have 2 ounces 20 minutes after, I don't usually drink milk.\n\n Most people could drink 2 to 4 ounces with a meat meal, I don't because of the lack of hydrochloric acid in my stomach.\n\n\r\nMost of you could probably wait 30, 35 minutes and have a cup.\n\n If you had half a cup with your meat meal, then have another half a cup, 30, 40 minutes later.\n\n Unless you're having your cheese at that time, cheese with honey.\n\n Then you don't want too much milk with cheese and honey.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) No Carbs In Morning and Vege Juice \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEating high carbohydrate foods for the first six hours that you're awake\n\n If you're on a good diet and not packing down fruits and carbohydrates, your body will make in the first 6 - 7 hours, all of the glycogen that will be used to run the brain and nervous system in those first 6, 7 hours.\n\n\r\nIf you eat high carbohydrate foods: fruit, carrot juice, any of those too much.\n\n Then your body will make the glycogen from carbohydrates, and you'll have a lot of advanced glycation end product that stores in the body causes mal-clarity of thinking.\n\n \r\nSo, if you eat proteins and stick with milk and stuff like that where there's not a high sugar value, then you make the glycogen from pyruvate with the help of glucagon.\n\n So, you only have 7% to 8% advanced glycation end product with that formation and we can handle 12% in a day, so there's no storage.\n\n \r\nWhen your body makes the glycogen from carbohydrates, you have a 70% - 90% storage of advanced glycation end products, and they collect in the body and that feeds cancer nicely.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut the vegetable juice doesn't count as a high carb food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust remember that, like I said in the recipe book, celery doesn't have enough carbohydrate to digest itself, it is a negative?\n\n So, even if you have carrot juice in, let's say you have 25% carrot juice and 25% celery, you've brought the sugar level way down t less than half, so it's not a high carbohydrate cuz you're not having that much.\n\n\r\nIf it's 25% of your juice.\n\n Let's say that's 3 tablespoons of carrot juice or 5 tablespoons of carrot juice, and then you've got the same amount of celery it's gonna offset it, and you're not gonna have much carbohydrate there to generate it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Penecilin, Grains \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou know Dechamp\n\n D E C H A M P?\n\n He was probably the best known biochemist who really was a doctor, Antoine Busan at the time of Pasteur.\n\n\r\nThere are quite a few, I refer to some of them in my Recipe Book in the last 50 pages, used look up their work.\n\n I didn't create it.\n\n I discovered it on my own without ever reading them, but once I read them, I thought, oh, it's already known.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey say penicillin saved 15% of casualties in the second world war.\n\n but you don't like penicillin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Penicillin is the worst thing invented since the wheel.\n\n\r\nIt's a lie about it saved 15%.\n\n How do you come up with that figure.\n\n Do you take one set of soldiers and you treat them with the same wounds with the penicillin and the others?\n\n No, they didn't do that?\n\n They did no controlled experiment.\n\n They just want to sell a product, but what I find is penicillin, once sterilized has no off switch, no hibernation.\n\n\r\nSo, it will eat on your body as long as you're a carbohydrate eater.\n\n If you eat any grain food, grain-based foods, you're going to feed penicillin in your body for your whole lifetime, and it mainly feeds in the intestines and brain.\n\n And I see it in- not everybody, 95/100 people.\n\n I see the penicillin pretty rampant and another 5/100 it's minimal, but still active in the brain and the intestines.\n\n\r\nI have seen some people, it's just all over their whole body and they wonder why they have fibromyalgia and have no energy.\n\n This penicillin is growing in their system like crazy.\n\n \r\nNow penicillin belongs in the bird community.\n\n The birds eat grains, that is one of their detoxification symptoms or aids to better health to getting rid of damaged tissue is the fungus, the penicillin fungus.\n\n But when we put it in our bodies, it grows in us because we live on grain-based foods, and it eats a lot because when we eat grains, we don't eat them raw, we eat them cooked.\n\n So, it damages cells, and then penicillin has a piece and in some people it is worse than others, but in most people, it is not a good thing.\n\n You can use lime juice, then there's no side effect.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Pineappel For Neck Artilage \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnyways, I had another one, I forgot what it's called, where the stuff's coming out of it, and it's 8 mm by 7 mm and I saw two neurosurgeons\n\n They wanna put a steel plate in there and a fusion and all that, and I am intent on healing it naturally.\n\n So, I'm wondering what part of your diet would be the most important thing for me to get the- there's a lot of pressure on the spinal column apparently that it's impinging on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's in your neck.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n That's the least pressure of anywhere in your body, but it's also the hardest to get circulation to it.\n\n \r\nAnything that repairs bone will repair cartilage, so the pineapple, a little bit of pineapple about every other day with some coconut cream, a little dairy cream and lots of cheese, little cheese with honey, or little honey with cheese like 1.\n\n5 tablespoons of cheese with about 3/4 of a teaspoon of honey after a meat meal, about 30 minutes after a meat meal will help give you a lot of minerals.\n\n\r\nEating bone marrow, little teaspoons throughout the day will help it rapidly, rubbing bone marrow into your neck before you go to sleep, putting hot water bottles at either side of your neck and a silk scarf over that to tent the heat in.\n\n That will increase the circulation, so more nutrients get into your neck and you can resolve it.\n\n \r\nUsually, you can resolve it within about 18 months to where there's no more danger, there's no more deterioration and you start adding to it.\n\n It'll take about 6, 7 years to completely clean it, but you shouldn't have any trouble as long as you keep your neck relaxed and stretched.\n\n \r\nSo, when you wake up in the morning, stretch your neck, get your chin to your chest, go over into the plow, stay in the plow for about five minutes  is the best thing you can do,.\n\n Keep everything stretched, so you don't have any compression, so you have plenty of circulation into the vertebrates.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you think it is possible to actually reduce the herniations and have fluid that's come out, come back in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHerniation's only because you've got too tight a neck.\n\n You're bruising your cartilage, you're causing herniations, you're causing sores.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoes that give headaches to you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUh, no?\n\n I have no headaches.\n\n The doctors are like, I can't believe you're walking and you can use your left arms to the left and I'm using my left arm fine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey can't believe they can't get a pool payment from you.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nIf you have no pain, you're not in that bad of shape.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I am in pain unfortunately.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust no headaches.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI'm a physical therapist, the only thing I would say is that a lot of times the herniation is because the vertebrae are in the wrong direction.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right cause you've got muscles that are too tight.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nExactly, but part of it is the exact opposite in the neck and the lumbar that when you do extension exercises, you pump extension, you pump the fluid and the disc back toward the anterior back toward the front, and that's what you want.\n\n You have to be careful with this because if you're pumping it back toward the back, you can push it out there.\n\n You can look online under McKenzie neck exercises, McKenzie back exercises, and they will tell you the kind of exercises to do and it would take a lot less time than what you're talking about if you pump the disc back into where it's supposed to.\n\n \r\nAnd part of it is all the flexion that we do all day, but with the neck exercises, you really wanna do what it says in the book.\n\n I don't wanna do anything like this right now, but I think it's really important to check out the position of the disc and your spine.\n\n\r\nYou're pumping it forward instead of pumping it back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're using those hot water bottles at night, you're not gonna have that problem because you keep everything relaxed and everything shoves back in the way it's supposed to.\n\n\r\nIf you're tight, and you go into a plow or any other neck position, or you can go to a chiropractor and have adjustments like that, you can really damage the tissue.\n\n But if you're relaxed and everything's heated and relaxed, you're not gonna have things go out of place.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I'd be careful with the exercises, unless you really know what you're doing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't think you have to be careful as long as you're doing the hot water bottle.\n\n I've had thousands of people do that, and not one has ever been injured as long as they do the hot water bottles.\n\n \r\nIf they try to do without the hot water bottles, some of 'em have been bruised, but that's cuz they don't listen.\n\n They think, \"Oh, I had it on last night, I don't need it tonight\".\n\n Every day's a new day, you have new acids going into your spine and your column.\n\n So, you have to make sure every day you take care of it if you're in a dangerous situation,\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Radiatio Nform Laptop \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm wondering what more I can do\n\n I'm eating bone marrow to tighten up my right front tooth that's still pretty loose.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre you tucking it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm trying to do that as best as I can?\n\n My gum isn't really lifting up that much to put it in there, but I did get a separate keyboard.\n\n \r\nI was sitting too close to my laptop and I'm very sensitive to the electromagnetic, so since I'm a lot further away from the computer, that seems to be helping me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRadiation, that's what I said.\n\n Radiation caused my bone loss around my teeth.\n\n So, if you've got a computer screen or an EMF field from a laptop and you're typing right off of your laptop, you're going to get a huge EMF field anywhere from 35 milligals to milligals 130.\n\n That's very, very strong.\n\n\r\n3 milligals is is all it takes to alter the structure of human cells, and you're dealing with a high level.\n\n So, you get a separate keyboard, plug it in and keep it about 8 inches away.\n\n The bottom of  the laptop to the top of your keyboard should be about 6.\n\n5 - 7 inches away.\n\n\r\nSo, your fingers never get within 8 inches of the bottom of the keyboard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I'm pretty far.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow, some of the Macs are a lower EMF field than others.\n\n \r\nMitsubishi and some of the other Japanese brands were really high.\n\n My Acer Ferrari, I got it for the speed.\n\n Acer is a brand.\n\n\r\nSo, mine is very high.\n\n Mine shoots up to about 90 milligals, so I have mine a whole 10 inches away from my laptop.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Regnerating Cells With Milk, Etc \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a chance to get some raw goats milk from a nearby farmer and I can get it never refrigerated\n\n Now, how much better is that gonna be for me than refrigerated cows milks that I have been drinking that I let sit out and how should I treat the raw goats milk.\n\n\r\nI get a couple gallons delivered to me?\n\n I just let 'em sit out, never put 'em in the refrigerator and just drink from them.\n\n Is the meat value that never refrigerated milk has, is that just gonna be evident for the first day or so, or Is there a point where it loses that value of never being refrigerated and what is the definite defined value of never being refrigerated for milk.\n\n Are certain enzymes and bacterias killed by refrigerating or are they just dormant?\n\n\r\nIs this gonna be a great value to me to have found a source of unrefrigerated goat milk that I can use?\n\n I imagine it will sit around for a week before I drink it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverybody heard everything he asked.\n\n That's a lot to answer?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nSo, anyway, goat milk is good for people who are overweight or have sugar problems.\n\n If you're underweight, goats milk has adrenal precursors and will cause you to be more hyperactive and very difficult to gain weight.\n\n \r\nHas anybody ever seen a fat goat.\n\n\r\nSeen a fat cow?\n\n\r\nAnd there's the difference?\n\n I've never been able to get anybody to get fat and be healthier on goats milk, unless they were already fat and had diabetes or some other sugar problem, and there the goats milk is preferable.\n\n \r\nNow, any milk that's been refrigerated loses its ability to increase cellular division, which means reproduction of cells.\n\n Cells in our bodies divide, become twins and grow up, have twins and grow up and mature, and that's how our body grows.\n\n \r\nThey don't have eggs, they don't have a full birth of a finished organism.\n\n They divide, the cells actually just split and then they grew up and become new cells, mitosis.\n\n \r\nIn milk, once you refrigerate it, it loses its exponential ability to promote cellular division.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell would it need to divide cellularly.\n\n Why would milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it doesn't divide cellularly?\n\n It promotes it in us when we eat it.\n\n We can do that as long as it's unrefrigerated and it doesn't drop below 72°.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhen we get our milk it's it's cold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep, so it's lost that ability.\n\n So.\n\n we have to rely upon meats.\n\n Meats that are frozen are the same way, they no longer will promote rapid cellular division.\n\n \r\nThe raw milk and the frozen meat can still help regenerate cells that are already alive, but it won't promote speedy cellular division.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do we need cell division for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo get younger and healthier and stronger?\n\n Most people are walking around half dead.\n\n When you see an old person walking across the street like this, how many cells do you think are alive in their body.\n\n 25%, holding up the whole weight, and then they're not well at the same time?\n\n\r\nSo, if a person gets on a raw diet with unfrozen raw meats and unrefrigerated raw dairy.\n\n They will be able to divide cells and get stronger and healthy, have more cells be able to do more.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Sore Muscles \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow back to just stretching again, it's fine, but it's still kind of just stiffness itself\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're too thin.\n\n You have nothing to arrest the uric acid, which is a byproduct metabolism.\n\n So, what your body does is uses calcium and other minerals to bind with those acids, and they cause crystals things.\n\n Cause more stiffness.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMore fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMore fat?\n\n\r\nYou could also drink some whey in the sport drink or drink whey by itself.\n\n Have a little vinegar, that helps break down uric acid.\n\n Any of those.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Sparkling Water Beenfits \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's Gerolsteiner\n\n Oh it is?\n\n Different bottles.\n\n\r\nThat one has more carbonation.\n\n Gerolsteiner well has more carbonation than any other well.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt's a good carbonation, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPlease?\n\n If you keep interrupting, we're gonna be here till midnight.\n\n \r\nI hate to be rude to you like that.\n\n\r\nIn every well, like San Pellegrino, Gerolsteiner, Perrier; in the wells, you have a water table, and then you have a gaseous table.\n\n They are never together, they shoot them together.\n\n So, the carbon is always added to the water, but it's a natural carbon.\n\n \r\nAnd those that don't say naturally carbonated, if they say carbonated natural water or carbonated naturally, carbonated naturally is okay cuz they're using the carbon from the well, instead of the synthesized carbon, like Coca-Cola, Pepsi and all your other soda companies do.\n\n\r\nNow Perrier used up all their carbon and they had no way to keep reproducing, so they went to Gerolsteiner and they got a deal where they buy their carbon.\n\n Perriers carbon is very low, San Pellegrinos is rather low.\n\n Apollinaris is the next best to Gerolsteiner if you want a lot of natural carbonation in yours.\n\n\r\nAnd the carbonation, what it can do is it can bleach out certain toxins in your blood.\n\n It's a natural hydrogen peroxide.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Sports Formula \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGiven it off in many\n\n It's like two cups in the We Want To Live book I have the hydration formula.\n\n When you're doing a heavy sport and you're perspiring a lot, you need more cucumber than tomato.\n\n So, I altered that recipe to have 2 - 2.\n\n5 cups of cucumber puree and 1 cup of tomato puree.\n\n\r\nSo, what you done is just swap it around.\n\n Instead of have a lot of tomato, you have more cucumber puree and like a tablespoon of vinegar, tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 - 4 tablespoons of coconut cream, 2 - 4 tablespoons of dairy cream, about 2.\n\n5 - 4 ounces of sparkling mineral water.\n\n\r\nYou blend all of that all together and you sip it throughout the day.\n\n \r\nWell, anytime after juice, probably about 15, 20 minutes.\n\n After meat, it would have to be probably an hour.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nAfter whey it's like an hour before anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBefore meat an hour?\n\n If it's juice you're going to have after the whey, then it could be 20 minutes.\n\n And what you can do is you could use whey instead of the water in the sport drink.\n\n You're a big guy, 4 ounces of whey instead of 4 ounces of water.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Stem Cells and How To Get Rid Of Wrinkles \n \n**[2008],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs that cuz of the stem cells\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, cause of the stem cells?\n\n The only three places we can find good stem cells that will work are from bone marrow, sperm and ovum.\n\n Very difficult to farm ovum.\n\n Anybody want to volunteer.\n\n And most of the sperm is not coming from real healthy men, but it still works,, but the bone marrow coming from an organic animal is terrific, phenomenal?\n\n \r\nDoes anybody know what's her name at Rawsome.\n\n Erica?\n\n She's done the diet a long time, but she's one of those women that never would gain excess weight.\n\n So she always stayed strong, trim, never got enough fat to remove all the dryness that she had, specially in the face.\n\n\r\nAnd the reason the face shrivels up faster on everybody is because of the heavy metals.\n\n Most of the metallic minerals go to the brain and nervous system cuz the brain nervous system use most of the metallic minerals to conduct electricity and transfer light.\n\n So, we have most of the metallic poisons are free radicals in the brain, when they dump: they dump out the gums of the tongue, the salivary glands, and that draws the fats out of the face, so the face shrivels.\n\n \r\nSo, even though she filled up and wasn't dry anywhere else, she never had enough to refill her face.\n\n Been on the diet probably 7 years, maybe 8.\n\n I suggested that she'd be one of my Guinea pigs and use bone marrow on her face, in three months, almost all the dryness was gone.\n\n\r\n85% of her wrinkles were gone in three months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow often.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShe did it three days a week?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRub it in and leave it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, you leave it?\n\n As long as you're using it fresh, you're getting it weekly, they won't stink.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Too Much Vinegar \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA teaspoon a day\n\n Just remember, if you have a lot of vinegar, you're going to decalcify, demineralize your system.\n\n So, you have to eat enough cheese to keep up with that.\n\n\r\nIf you're having a teaspoon of vinegar, I would say you need to eat at least 3 tablespoons of cheese in a day.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat about drinking lots of milk.\n\n Is that just as good?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot quite?\n\n Because you have concentrated minerals in cheese.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Toothpaste Formula \n \n**[2008],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor those of us that are using the toothpaste of formula after brushing\n\n How often does one use a water pick to rinse it, and is that necessary.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n I came up with a new formula about probably a year ago, and it's 1 tablespoon of coconut cream, 2 teaspoons of Terramin clay and 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of raw apple cider vinegar.\n\n\r\nNow the great thing about this is that it actually whitens, as well as just rips the plaque off of the teeth, just melts it, dissolves it away without damaging the dentine, unless you brush too often with it.\n\n Once a day is fine.\n\n\r\n1 tablespoons coconut cream\r\n2 teaspoons Terramin clay\r\n1/2 - 1 teaspoon raw apple cider vinegar\r\n\r\nAnd you brush it down into the gums.\n\n All these big toothbrushes, I don't think are good.\n\n I think you should get one of those baby toothbrushes, very soft and just brush, work that down in there and it will dissolve the plaques, so you don't have to have deep root cleanings.\n\n I have found that I haven't had to use my water pick, maybe every three months or something like that and do that routine that I talk about on wewant2live.\n\ncom where I talked about the formula for getting deep down and removing the, the plaque and other tars.\n\n And also found that when you use this particular formula that it helps gums reverse the receding mm-hmm.\n\n\r\nIn the last four months, I've also experimented with bone marrow, and applying bone marrow and rubbing it into the gums and even brushing it into the gums will bring the gums back almost a half of a millimeter overnight.\n\n \r\nYou got receding gums.\n\n Come right back?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, when you say brush it in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou take the bone marrow and you get it soft and wet like it's fat?\n\n You can either rub it up in your fingers and push it at the end or you could take a toothbrush and-\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) TRIBES \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCambodia, Vietnam, still in Vietnam there are some primitive tribes, but not completely\n\n Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia and never found a truly primitive tribe.\n\n So, this time I went to Philippines, after I went to Thailand, I finally covered my vehicle, all of Thailand, except for the Southern Peninsula.\n\n \r\nSo, I got to every tribe there was, and still no primitive tribes.\n\n So, Philippines have 7,107 islands, and they can't populate all of them, so a lot of them have very primitive tribes that live in the old ways.\n\n\r\nThe government would not allow me to go see them.\n\n They tell you they're cannibals.\n\n They give you all these crazy stories, cuz it's just like the American government are telling everybody that all the natives are savages and they will kill you and all of that.\n\n So, of course everybody who was shooting the natives and then it turned them that way, the American Indians.\n\n\r\nSo, Philippine government is doing the same thing and the corporations, they want to do away with the Indian culture, so that they can absorb the land and all their resources.\n\n \r\nSo, there was this one little boy who was about 5.\n\n5 months old, and his father was black.\n\n The mother was dark brown and the baby was toe white, whiter than I was as a baby, and I was white.\n\n And I could see he was pretty anemic and the mother had fed him powdered milk because that's what the government and the media tell them is the best thing for babies.\n\n \r\nAnd we know from the Pottenger experiments that the most diseases were created in the cats that were fed powdered milk.\n\n We know in our society that a great deal of anemia is causing children from powdered milk.\n\n So, the baby was very anemic and lots of digestive problems, diarrhea all the time.\n\n \r\nI happen to go for a massage at a spa clinic there, it's the only place you can get one that isn't sexual.\n\n So, that's where I have to go even though I don't like to go to the mall type spas like that.\n\n So, that's where I went to get a massage and this mother was about 24 years old, had her baby there.\n\n And so I got to talk with them.\n\n I went over to a nearby island, Samal and was able to get some raw milk at a dairy there.\n\n That's where I was getting mine as I was traveling around Philippines and they wouldn't even rent a car to me when I told them I was going over to a certain part of the island.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause they tell you it's dangerous?\n\n The natives will eat you alive or cooked.\n\n\r\nSo, I went over to the Samal island, got some milk on three days with this baby with raw milk, the color came in in only three days, all the digestive problems resolved.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid he go brown.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, he went brown?\n\n In three days went brown.\n\n He went from toe white to as brown as you are in three days.\n\n Of course the mother was as dark as you, but the father was black, so I expect that since he was a male baby that he will go darker as he gets older because of the father, but that's my theory.\n\n \r\nAnyway, the grandfather of the child happened to be an ex native around Mati, the villages of Mati and the islands beyond that, and he had left when he was about 20 years old and he's about 53 now.\n\n So, he was so grateful for the change in his grandson that he said, he's gonna give me permission, cuz he works for the government.\n\n Also, he would give me permission to go visit those tribes and they wouldn't give him permission.\n\n \r\nSo, he said I'm taking you anyway.\n\n So, we had a motorcycle back on, take a boat across the island and then motorcycle from there with a motorcycle on the boat and motorcycle about five miles in and then hike about five miles.\n\n So, it's a 10 mile stretch back to the mountains and these natives all raw.\n\n\r\nThey lived on raw fish, three foods.\n\n That's all they ate, no variety, three foods: raw fish that they fish for every day, and that's their life, they fish.\n\n That's their life.\n\n It's a great life.\n\n They're in retirement from day one and they're happy people and they eat coconut coconut meat, they don't juice it.\n\n They eat the whole coconut meat.\n\n They eat  the fish and they eat a little bit of fruit, either banana or mangoes and very little fruit and are full bodied and thick.\n\n I expected them to be skinny because they lived on just raw fish, but they were all thick.\n\n I mean, thicker than I am, and I was quite impressed by all that.\n\n And the ones that were 70 and 80 years old had beautiful thick white teeth.\n\n Only one woman had some missing teeth, but she had a busted lip, so I assumed that was from an accident, falling out of a coconut palm or something.\n\n \r\nWhoever said tree, I wrote a book, an agricultural book on palms years ago, and the man who helped educate me on that said, \"If anybody ever says in front of you, and this is the only way I'll help you write this book.\n\n If anybody ever calls a palm, a tree, you have to correct them.\n\n Trees have branches and leaves.\n\n Palms have Frans.\n\n There are no branches.\n\n So palms are not trees\".\n\n So, back to the tribe.\n\n They're Palm.\n\n There's no Palm tree.\n\n They're just a Palm.\n\n Palm has a trunk with Frans.\n\n \r\nSo, all of these people had great teeth, the 70 and 80 year olds looked like they were 40, 45 years old.\n\n They took me to one of the elders who was the shaman, cuz of course that's who I want to talk to, the shaman to find out they're healing methods.\n\n\r\nOnce in a while they eat honey, but they don't like to disturb the bees because they pollinate around and they told me there's so much pollution around that they're afraid to bother the bees and take their honey.\n\n So, only for medicinal purposes, do they use honey.\n\n They don't eat it, but they don't need it.\n\n Incredible health.\n\n So, it was pretty great to finally find a primitive tribe, a truly primitive tribe, tribe lives with their self-made garments in their own hut.\n\n And they were rather nomadic to because they like to shift places, even though the island is only about probably 14 x 6 miles.\n\n\r\nIt's about 4 miles wide and mountainous.\n\n They still like to travel around the island and there'll be different groups of things that rotate and go around.\n\n It's something they like to do, it's part of their adventure.\n\n So, that's my story from this last trip.\n\n Are there any questions about them that I maybe can answer.\n\n Maybe not?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you find just that one primitive tribe or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, there were two on that particular island, and I was told that definitely don't go to the island beyond Mati because there were definitely cannibals?\n\n There were not any cannibals.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThis was on Somali.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, Somal?\n\n This was another island.\n\n This is island beyond Mati.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut these people are Somali.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they were on the island beyond Somal?\n\n I don't know what the name of the island was.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey just ate fish, no meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFish is meat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean no red meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo red meat?\n\n Once in a while they catch a wild pig, but it's rare cuz they pretty much killed all of the other animals on the island and eaten them, so they just live on fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas it a completely wild island.\n\n Were there any other civilization at all?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere was no developed civilization There was no bicycle, there was nothing?\n\n The only one that was there was the one we took, the motor bike to get up a certain way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas there a little outpost or anything of at all.\n\n So, they completely had the island to themselves?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCompletely to themselves?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd they've never been intruded on or barely.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you know, government people go over there of course and check things out, and they do it from the air, but nobody goes to live there unless you're one of the tribe?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I was interested about they were complaining about the pollution.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to understand that this was off of the island of Minanao.\n\n The big island, that's their biggest island, Minanao.\n\n If you take a trip all the way down over to Mati and then there's groups of islands out there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, they wereaware that there was like pollution coming from the other island.\n\n**[Aajonus],[unclear] there and [unclear]**\n\r\nWell, you could see it coming cuz you've got a major port in \n is a big city, the biggest city on that island.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo they use fire for anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI asked them that and they said sometimes for burning brush cuz they don't have the primitive tools?\n\n So, sometimes they'll do that.\n\n Sometimes if they want to seal something.\n\n And once in a while, I'd ask them that if they used any herbs and mainly they don't use any herbs, except once in a while, if a cut is too large.\n\n They don't have the beef like we do to make as a patch, so fish doesn't work the same.\n\n You can't cut it cause it will dry out very quickly.\n\n \r\nAnd it was so great.\n\n I would go shopping in the evening and everything was fresh caught that day.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n And I mean, tuna are this big around, swordfish that big around, and I was getting them fished and caught that day never under ice or anything.\n\n I was eating like three pounds at a sitting.\n\n It was $1.\n\n50 a pound.\n\n I was paying $5 a kilo and you know, it's 2 & 1/3 pounds.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDid you the glands in there too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI got some glands, definitely?\n\n I got eyeballs, I got all kinds.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, their fat is coconut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what they ate?\n\n The women probably ate a half of a coconut a day, and some of the men ate up to 3/4 of a coconut a day.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe coconut grows on a tree, they don't have to pay for it or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n No tree, palms *laughs*, you just see them just shimmy up like  monkeys.\n\n It's just an everyday thing for them.\n\n One fellow who had left the tribe and gone back to the tribe, he had notches in his palm, so he could climb up easier.\n\n I guess he got out of the back of it.\n\n It was pretty cool.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nHow old do they get.\n\n\r\nWhat were the oldest people?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe shaman was about probably 82 and looked about 43, 45?\n\n I looked at some of the older ones that I asked and he said, \"We really can't tell you, but probably 120 years old\".\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAny illness at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNone?\n\n No, just the injuries.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do they die.\n\n\r\nThey just go off and die?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey just go to sleep?\n\n But they're very controlled tribes.\n\n They don't have children, unless the whole tribe agrees.\n\n Because when a child is born into a tribe, the child is the child of everybody in the tribe.\n\n It's not just an isolated, the child doesn't belong to the mother.\n\n The whole tribe's the mother and father.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow many people about in the tribe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can have sections of tribes that migrate differently, cuz they don't like to overpopulate an area?\n\n They like to leave everything pretty unchanged when they change locations.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how many in a group then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was only allowed one there one day?\n\n\r\nSo, some of the group that I saw had been fishing, and so I got to see about 8 people and probably were 4 off fishing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt is really small.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, very small little communities.\n\n But let's say the whole tribe is probably a couple hundred on the whole island.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo they have schools and things like that too, or they don't do that kind of thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're teaching the kids every day, learn how to fish?\n\n They learn.\n\n And you don't need to know much.\n\n If you're healthy, you don't need to know much.\n\n If you don't have to go to a job every day, you don't need to know much, just survival.\n\n Food is your most important thing in your whole environment.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWere you able to take pictures.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n If I had gotten caught with the pictures and the government found me, I would've been brought in jail, 15 years.\n\n 15 years to get caught in any of those areas.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust to take a picture.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that means I would've been there?\n\n I didn't have pictures there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBirth control.\n\n It's just that whenever everybody agrees?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're smart?\n\n They pull, they never ejaculate in a woman unless she's on her period.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas there any evidence of the use of toothbrushes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they have some bark that they'll use if something gets stuck in their teeth, but they don't brush their teeth?\n\n White, no receding gums, good thick red gums, and dark almost purple red gums.\n\n Just very healthy and the thickest, most beautiful teeth I'd ever seen.\n\n From the young to the old, no dental decay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo need for orthodontia.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n Everybody had perfect teeth.\n\n Perfect alignment, some have smaller.\n\n Some have a narrower frame and some were larger.\n\n  I don't like the stuff that Weston Price put out there that all the natives who were raw, more raw, had all very large jowls and very large bridges.\n\n\r\nI saw it depends upon the gene.\n\n If your parents have a small mouth, then you're going to have a smaller bridge for your teeth.\n\n So, those big jaws that Price talks about his book that all have, it's not true.\n\n Some are small, even in the Maasai tribe, I've seen some of their mouths small and some very large, their bridges.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nBut they still had straight teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, every one?\n\n I didn't see any.\n\n In all of the other cities and I visited, probably 30 cities and all the civilized more advanced group.\n\n They had little spikes fangs, and all these crooked teeth.\n\n You could see it was not healthy and there's people that's living in slum swamps, and they don't clean up.\n\n They throw their plastic, they're not taught ecology at all.\n\n And they go to the waterfalls with shampoo and put their soap in the water and stuff like that.\n\n So, I look at that and I say, they have no idea they're poisoning the fish.\n\n They don't have a clue because they're not educated, you're educated that technology.\n\n Everything they give you is totally healthy.\n\n The powdered milk and all of that, and it's all just a big lie.\n\n And these people were getting sicker sicker.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIn the seventies, in Southern Mexico, they were feeding all the babies powdered milk and they were dying and we'd have to hold them in water to try and get water in their bodies.\n\n Cuz the mothers thought that, \"Well, this powdered milk comes from the US, were not gonna nurse anymore\".\n\n It was terrible.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's very sad, it's very ugly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd they were overrun the parasites.\n\n**[Aajonus][Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell that's because they eat all the carbohydrates and toxic food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n Because they were living on toxins.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to understand, I have eaten meat since  September of 1976, raw meat and have eaten parasite, infested meat at least 23 times out of 10,000 times that I've eaten raw meat.\n\n And remember, I had a vagotomy, so I have no hydrochloric acid that dumps in my stomach.\n\n\r\nAnd I have never gotten once a parasite connected with meat.\n\n I got a parasite one time and I induced that with fermenting milk way beyond what it should be into an alcohol with maca root.\n\n And I got a tapeworm and tapeworm lives on sugar.\n\n \r\nThat's why all these third world countries who get these cereals and powdered milk given to them, mix it in water.\n\n They all get these tapeworms, cuz the tapeworm isn't eating their intestines, they're eating the excess carbohydrate.\n\n And if a person's only getting carbohydrate and they're human, of course parasite needs to eat the food so that the body doesn't degenerate with all the advanced glycation end product, because it will just melt.\n\n\r\nSo, those tapeworms for those people, especially children who eat cereals and powdered milk in Africa and, Asia, anywhere like that.\n\n They have those parasites because of that particular diet.\n\n So, don't give any aid, don't give donations to those companies to do that, and most of them do it.\n\n\r\nYou ask them if you're giving welfare package to these people, what are you buying for them.\n\n Most of them make a deal with Purina, Kellogg's, General Mills, and General Foods on all the discarded bad product they can't sell in this country?\n\n They sell it to these welfare companies, these good meaning companies, the worst food in the world, and they send it over in there and give it to these children.\n\n\r\nBut what it does is it kills them.\n\n Bangladesh, all those places, it kills them.\n\n They want to wipe them out to take over their resources.\n\n It's food warfare is basically what it is.\n\n And if you think the intention isn't that, look at what they did to the American Indian.\n\n \r\nYou're right here in this country and you look at what they did to them, they wouldn't let them cook.\n\n I mean they wouldn't let them eat raw.\n\n They made them eat grains and flour and not eat good meat.\n\n They put 'em in deserts where nothing grows properly, no meat.\n\n So, you have to take a look at that.\n\n They would give them flour and lard.\n\n And if they got caught farming, they would be killed.\n\n\r\nSo, it wasn't until the 1930s where some of that started changing, but 26 million American Indians were already wiped out, poisoning, and killing of course, guns and whatever they could do, however they could kill them.\n\n And that's what you have to think about these people who go into power and governments.\n\n\r\nThey think that war is okay, history tells us war is okay, and it's okay to become a Caesar or somebody like that who wants to dominate and control the world.\n\n And that's cool to do that and that's acceptable and you can do anything to the people you want to, you can murder them, you can rape and pillage because it's war and they'll always find some reason, \"Oh, we go to war for God\".\n\n\r\nThey've got a different God than we do, they don't believe the way we do, and they're going to kill us.\n\n Same thing they're doing with the Islam.\n\n \r\nSo, it goes on, Russians were coming, the Russians were coming, remember.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe cold war?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's no Russians coming, never was.\n\n\r\nIt's a way to keep the blue market, the blue chip market going, selling ammunition's and keeping the huge war machine going.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Tumor \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a little tumor at my temple here  and it's broken the skin, and you say in your book that you should not eat any fruit\n\n And I'm wondering if in the category of fruit you include coconut and tomato.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Those are fine.\n\n And if you you've got a surface cancer, put vinegar on it.\n\n Put lime juice, vinegar, and coconut cream lime.\n\n\r\nVinegar three minutes and coconut cream on top of that for 20 minutes, don't wipe it off for a while.\n\n  \r\nI've gotten rid of about 30 skin tumors within three months working with that with people.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you do 'em separately and one on top of the other.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne on top of the other and you rinse them off in between?\n\n\r\nYou let one soak in and the other soak in, and then finally the coconut cream doesn't soak in right away.\n\n It takes 30 minutes or so before it gets a little sticky and then you can just wipe it off, but don't rinse it off.\n\n You want to maintain it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Tumor On Dog, Dogs Are Toxic \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy family has a dog, she's about 9 years old and about a year ago she started growing a big bone tumor on her nose, and since then it got like, it closed up her left eye and the eye rolled back kind of\n\n\r\nAnd she's been mostly on dog food, but for four months now, I've been feeding her ground chicken mix, liver and eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll raw.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\nShe lost some weight and her coat looks really good and everything and her teeth looked better, but the bone tumor seems to be getting worse.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, dogs and cats are hard to reverse cancer.\n\n In fact, I find it's almost impossible because dogs and cats do not perspire, except out their nose, tongue, and anus.\n\n So, they can't secrete all the poisons.\n\n So, if you feed them any kind of processed food, they have a lot of metallic minerals in them, a lot of preservative, a lot of food coloring, a lot of stuff that dogs and cats don't normally eat.\n\n \r\nSo, they are probably the most toxic creatures on this planet, even more so than humans if they're fed kibble and canned foods.\n\n So, it's very hard to reverse cancer.\n\n Normally, what happens is you put 'em on a good diet.\n\n She has a dog 9 years old mainly on cooked foods, but for the last four months she's been feeding it raw foods.\n\n The coat's better, the dog's healthier, everything's better, but the tumor isn't disappearing and it's closed an eye, and it's probably the situation is that the dog is going to have to live with the cancer, but healthier.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) WAR INDUSTRY \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe war industry in this country, just for gasoline, the oil barrels that we burn for our military all over the world is 183 million barrels a day just for our military\n\n That's big money.\n\n They like it.\n\n They're not gonna let it go.\n\n And they'll kill anybody to do it, including you, anybody in this room, even if you're an American.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Weed Is Worse Tha Ncigarettes \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMarijuana\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMarijuana, it's worse?\n\n Tars are 16 times greater in marijuana than cigarettes.\n\n So, one joint is worth a pack of cigarettes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can still use the same method.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're gonna have to juice the marijuana, but you're gonna get high?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about cleaning the actual.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know, but it will still make you high while you're getting clean, but you won't have the down?\n\n When you take marijuana juice raw like that in green, you get a nice high and it lasts over about 3 - 5 days and there's no down.\n\n So, just be aware that you're going to be a little high when you do that cleansing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) What Aajonus Washes Face With \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can wash your face and then put it on after you wash your face\n\n\r\nI wash only with coconut cream, fermented coconut cream.\n\n It's the best soap.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFermented, not regular coco cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you use regular Coco cream it won't be quite as soapish because the fermentation, the alcohol's in it help make it a soap?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo you ferment it by leaving it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I just leave it out on the counter with no refrigeration, I do leave a top on it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow many days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThree, four days?\n\n It'll have a bad odor.\n\n It'll go through a period of a foul odor.\n\n It's not real foul, but a foul odor.\n\n After about 9 to 10 days goes back to coconut odor again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe put Gerolsteiner on his face first.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that was to help cleanse it, but I don't suggest Gerolsteiner anymore, unless you can get in glass.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI do, I'm trying.\n\n When I called, she said, we do send it in plastic and glass.\n\n So, I have to call it again tonight and see what she says.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I haven't seen it in this country.\n\n\r\nEvery other country I've seen it in glass, but this country.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAt Whole Foods they have it in glass.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich Whole Foods.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nThe one in Sherman Oaks, they have it in glass?\n\n They have it in glass.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

haven't found anything in my experiments with people on this diet, haven't found any difference?\n\n But when I'm living just on like two or three foods, I do notice the difference.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, what's the a1 doing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA1, I will have less energy from?\n\n\r\nA2, I have more energy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does that mean.\n\n I don't know what A1 and A2 means?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a certain kind of genetic makeup that builds the milk.\n\n There are certain chemicals that are produced in A2 cows that are not produced A1 cows?\n\n\r\nWell, it's just because some cows have been crossbred and it's caused a problem.\n\n Your jerseys, most of them are A2.\n\n Holsteins are usually A1.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does Eli have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe has both, but they're all moving to a A2's?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat about that Organic Pastures milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't trust Mark as far as I can say?\n\n There was a few years when he was feeding them organic rice bran.\n\n You can't feed organic rice bran because once the brand has been processed with steam to get it off of the rice, it's processed and bran is not a complete food.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI remember that.\n\n It was awful a couple times.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause you got gibberellic acid in the bran.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat's that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGibberellic acid is an acid, it's a fatty acid?\n\n It's an ester in the bran that causes swelling.\n\n\r\nThey extract it from rice bran to give to grapes and other plants to make them big and swollen.\n\n But that causes swelling of the brain, swelling a lot of people's systems.\n\n And it's really bitter and nasty tasting when the ester that are really bitter aren't removed and usually they remove them and it's even more toxic cause they use kerosene to do that.\n\n\r\nSo, when the gibberellic acid in the bran is digested by the cow, it doesn't break down that that bitter ester.\n\n**[Attendee #3],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd so when you drink Organic Pasture's milk, your brain is-\r\n\n\r\nThey don't do it anymore.\n\n I came down on on Mark pretty hard for it.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAnd what's he been doing presently.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know what he is doing?\n\n That's why I say, I don't trust the man.\n\n He was saying organic, organic, organic and he was feeding them non-organic substances for two years.\n\n That was way back in 2003 and 2004.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHow long it take for something like that to go out of the animal system?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, out of the milk, it would take about 20, 25 days?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you trust Claravale.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAs you can see, I'm drinking out of their bottle, but this is the milk from Pennsylvania, the Amish milk?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat they delivered to your house in California from Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n We have a truck that brings it to us.\n\n\r\nWe're a buying club.\n\n No one in Santa.\n\n Rawsome was closed?\n\n \r\nThis is a private one.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut this is the food, the milk that, all the food that's coming from Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that private.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can't go there and buy anything, you have to order online and then you go pick it up?\n\n There's a pickup place.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAlso, the people that are doing this co-op, they're trying to minimize attention so the authorities don't get involved.\n\n\r\nSo if you join 'em, you have to be recommended because the word goes out and they could easily get busted, so there's a lot of precautions being taken.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut there's a delivery down here on Saturday afternoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEvery two weeks.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Body Fat, Body Fat Testing, Cooked Fat \n \n \n \n \n### (3) Activity Rings, Damage From Vegeatarianism \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI you have a lot of activity rings in your eyes, that means you produce a lot of testosterone, estrogen, and adrenaline for physical activity\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have like  5 - 7 of those.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nShe's only got 5 - 7.\n\n I think I had 11.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, did you.\n\n Sometimes I feel energetic and that's a lot?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, you won't change.\n\n You have that same amount, but sometimes you'll have the energy and the physical ability to be naturally 6 or 7 activity rings.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIf a person has activity rings, but they're not very robust and and more on the depressed side, like low energy.\n\n What does that mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt means you were a vegetarian?\n\n \r\nNo, you fucked up your system.\n\n It takes a long time to correct it.\n\n\r\nThe damage that vegetarianism does to the digestive tract and the whole body is tremendous.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, I did vegetarianism for 10 years.\n\n Because I lived in the tropics: I had coconut every day, I had avocados every day, I had a little bit of salad.\n\n\r\nBut the thing is, it was so hot and I didn't want to cook anymore.\n\n I hated cooking.\n\n But,  that was it.\n\n You know, I didn't need anything.\n\n I had coconut every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nStill not enough protein, coconuts, only 15% protein.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI had coconuts every day, the jelly kind.\n\n I had avocado.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDamages the whole digestive tract and all the energy system.\n\n You weren't getting enough protein.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, although mentally there's a lot of activity, the body is in the healing proces, leansing process.\n\n So, what do you do to sort of like, assist it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGet high meat, high egg, rotten?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOh hell.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nShe won't even take an egg that's not washed.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, the problem is I'm in the environment where you can't have that because like you'd be thrown out.\n\n\r\nOkay, so high meat and high eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're living with people.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nUh, yeah?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Athlets Low Body Fat \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA lot of these athletes go around with 7% body fat, like your marathon runners, 7% body fat\n\n That's why they break down in their thirties.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey have a heart attack running.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey had no cholesterol, all that shit.\n\n That's what I mean.\n\n The doctors are so full of crap.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does cholesterol do for the bod again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCholesterol is fat: cleans it, protect, it does everything?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe cholesterol protects the body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProtects the body?\n\n It cleans it, gives it energy.\n\n Without cholesterols, we wouldn't be alive.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Butter On Plane \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWithout having enough butter and stuff, now I make sure I have enough butter with me\n\n I take it up 30 - 50 pounds with me.\n\n I take it through with me.\n\n I have a letter from my doctor.\n\n \r\nI tell them, \"He's going to Asia.\n\n He's been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n The blood, bone, stomach and lymph.\n\n He was diagnosed as diabetic\".\n\n This was 40 and 50 years ago see, but it doesn't say that when he was diagnosed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, he got the same letter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no.\n\n What I'm saying, it's just that he was diagnosed with it, but it doesn't say when.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI mean, if they look at you, then they shouldn't believe it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n will go through as if I was, I'll go through limping and crippled.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nWon't they sell you butter.\n\n What's wrong with Thai butter?\n\n\r\nCan you buy butter in Thailand?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but it's not as good?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, but won't they tell you that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, cause they don't know?\n\n They don't know you can get raw butter there.\n\n No, it says on the letter raw butter.\n\n What kind of cancer do you have.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWon't they tell you, you can get raw butter here?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they don't know because it says in the letter, it's hard to find and get, and they don't provide it on the airplane.\n\n \r\nSo, I take two quarts of milk on with me.\n\n \r\nWhen I go to Asia, it says in my doctor's letter, I take up to 50 pounds of butter, I take up to three quarts of milk sometimes, and then I have my honey, I take my meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, the liquid of milk, you can take that on a plane.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, not unless you have a doctor's letter?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOn American airplanes, they don't stop you with these stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot with my letter?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd what about the guy sitting next to you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n don't give a shit.\n\n I've taken high meat and eating it right on the airplane.\n\n Stinky stuff.\n\n \r\nAnd there was a biologist that was writing a food contamination paper and I was eating it right in front of her.\n\n The poor woman, she was like this.\n\n She was, she was like this.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI wrote my own letter.\n\n Is that okay.\n\n I just said I had cancer?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's fine.\n\n Once in a while, they'll call my doctor.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Cellulite \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nHow get rid of the cellulite\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, to get rid of cellulite?\n\n Cellulite is old fat that is bound with toxin and it hardens.\n\n It gets dehydrates cause its very toxic fats, so it hardens and hardens.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThen when you get rid of it the new fats come in and it cause it to swell up again gradually or quickly and then you'll see big clumps.\n\n That's when the body starts dissolving it.\n\n Then they have to pass it through the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nPasses the cellulite through the skin, right wet.\n\n Does it break down into a liquid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes?\n\n That's why you have to have the hot baths.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's how you get rid of your cellulite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's how you get rid of all the waste waste.\n\n90% of the waste, the lymph system dumps under the skin to be perspired out the body, 90%.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, without the baths, your urine and feces doesn't get very rid very everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n Very small.\n\n Well, they'll dump stuff out of the liver, the pancreas, the gallbladder, the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder, out of the urine and then out of the intestinal tract, but normally everything else moves out the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThe body fat, the muscle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEverything moves out the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHot baths are so valuable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nVery, especially with all the hydrogenated vegetables and processed food we were raised on: cereal, donuts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou ate donuts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh God?\n\n I was donut-oholic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nHe was a pig when he was little.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI used to love those powder cake donuts and go through boxes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nHe wasn't born on the primal diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, that's why I was supposed to die at 21.\n\n I was very sickly.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nDid you gain your weight back after these injections.\n\n Now you look pretty good?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, I'm better.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nDo you have your weight back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot quite as much as I want?\n\n When I left October 18th, I was 192 pounds, now I'm only 182, so I was 10 pounds more when I left last, but I'm putting it back on.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, you look great.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI didn't go down as much this time I rationed my butter and drank more milk than I usually did.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat did you get down to after that injection at your lowest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI went down to probably 150?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI can't keep my clothes; I have everything from a 2 to a 12.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, when I left when I was 92 pounds, I had a 36-inch waist.\n\n So, I've got 34\" - 37\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's not bad though.\n\n That seems like a normal variance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd then I've got 32\", which will take me up to 33\" and down a little bit.\n\n I have 30\" and 30\" will take me down to as little as 29\" and up to as highest 32\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nLike, I can't even get jackets on anymore, but I have muscle in my back and my arms and I dunno if it's muscle or fat I'm like, \"What the hell, I've never had that\".\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, the belt size is the size that I really have to have three.\n\n On these, I have two different sizes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell see, this has never changed.\n\n Is that part of getting older.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI'm gaining it in my arms, my back?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, wherever you have toxins for it.\n\n he used to talk and I was too good up there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI can't put my jacket on *laughs*.\n\n So I go, okay, I wanna lose this.\n\n Is that appropriate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf your body can melt the fats?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd you know that by whether you get really toxic on the down diet.\n\n \r\n\r\nHow do you know that the down diet appropriate then?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you shouldn't have symptoms on the down diet, especially rashes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, you don't get nauseated or stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, if you're eating that little bit of cheese?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou shouldn't, because you are gonna dump toxins when you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nMost of it if you've taken the hot baths, it's supposed to go out the skin.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (7) Claravale \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, you don't trust the Claravale\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nClaravale, there's nothing organic about it?\n\n It's not organic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but they're natural, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they they feed them hay cuz there's no grass?\n\n They don't have big pastures, very small pasture.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt's just a good glass bottle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, he buys the milk, throws it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I drank the milk cause I didn't have anything else.\n\n There was no Organic Pastures, I didn't have anything else, but I drank it, but I keep the bottles.\n\n\r\nSometimes it's easier to suck outta this bottle.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cold Hands and Feet Is Mineral Deficieny. Cheese and Honey \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have cold hands and feet all the time for many years\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSevere mineral deficiency.\n\n For about four or four days eat about a pound of cheese a day with about a half a cup of honey.\n\n Half a cup of honey with a pound of cheese half a pound of cheese.\n\n\r\nYou mash 'em together.\n\n You do that 3, 4 days in a row.\n\n You can have it throughout the day.\n\n You don't have to have it all at one time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou're gonna have eight ounces throughout the day with the half a cup of honey and that's for minerals.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI have cold feet too, especially at night.\n\n I wear sock on most days.\n\n So, I need to do the same thing too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that solved the problem for a long time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt solved it for three or four weeks?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nTo do that formula three to four days in a row.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\nIf that happens to me.\n\n I only have to eat it one day, but I used to have 2, 3,4 days, usually three days, then it went down to two days.\n\n Now it's one day.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat happens if the the cheese is salted.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSalted, won't work?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Cucumber Puree Important To Chew, Oil Pulling \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nhat's fine\n\n But I'm saying you're still not gonna get the effect of the cucumber and tomato unless they're blended together.\n\n Well, you might have a lot of, let's say dental anesthesia in here.\n\n Sometimes the body needs to get it out of the salivary glands by chewing.\n\n \r\nWell, you get a lot of bacteria.\n\n The more you chew, the more bacteria you're going to get into your food.\n\n You also get more toxins that are discharging from the brain out the salivary glands.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you get more bacteria when you chew.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe have more bacteria in our bowels than dogs and cats?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you get back to by chewing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour bacteria is in your part of your salivary gland?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd so when you chewing you are getting rid of toxins from your brain when you're chewing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, sometimes?\n\n\r\nWhat I tell people do, if they have that kind of impulse is do some oil pulling, take some coconut oil and swish it around in the mouth and chew and keep it in there and spit it out after about 10, 15 minutes and then go ahead and chew all you want.\n\n\r\nKeep it in your mouth.\n\n Keep working until you pull all this stuff out, takes about 10, 15 minutes, you're chewing, hold it that sleuth.\n\n Then if you go 12 hours, your gums may have filled up again.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does oil pulling do.\n\n It pulls what out?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nChemicals out of your gums and salivary gland?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you've got the coconut oil and you're kind of just swishing it around or you're kind of like also doing the chewing motion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll of it, 10 - 15 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, when you do the nut formula and you take brain detox towards that, it's a binding.\n\n The net formulas kinda.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI said if you have it too often \r\n\n\r\nOh, then it detoxes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it can cause a brain detox.\n\n Otherwise the nut formula just grabs excess hormone and some poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is it a good thing to detox the brain with the nut formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't think so?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat is a good brain detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPutting hot water bottles at your head?\n\n Cilantro.\n\n\r\nThey'll get down to your gland here.\n\n Glands are supposed to take care of you, your lymph glands.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Dairy Allergies \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, I suggest that everybody does\n\n People say, well, I have an allergy to it, this and this, and that happens.\n\n I say, bear through it.\n\n You know, you're not gonna get a better source of minerals and a better source of fat for the nervous system, unless you're having dairy.\n\n So suffer through it, and then you'll get through it eventually.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause I get something, especially mentally, it's not working.\n\n I mean, I get stoned, I get, I lose my memory.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're getting a protein deficiency.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, by drinking milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're getting a protein deficiency because you're using all the minerals to detox toxins out of the brain then you're not eating enough meat, eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I'm eating all the raw meat and eggs and all this.\n\n But when I take milk- I'm doing sort of good, but every time I try milk, it's doing that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHow are you taking the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's warm and I drink it without food?\n\n\r\nNormally without food.\n\n\r\nAnd I have another thing in my gut, I have very much discomfort as if I'm going to get diarrhea often.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you've got a lot of poisons and you need cheese.\n\n\r\nYou're eating the cheese regularly.\n\n Small amount, like a sugar cube size, not a half teaspoon, and every 30 minutes you'll be able to drink the milk easily.\n\n  \r\nRight now your body's using all of the minerals in the milk and then without the minerals, you can't digest the fat properly, the cream.\n\n \r\nNow, that can make your brain slow.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI remember it took me a few years with the milk and then all of a sudden on few years on the diet, the milk was just like life saving.\n\n It was like I wanted it.\n\n \r\nBefore I couldn't have any.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen I start drinking milk, I can't stop.\n\n I have a full craving for it and I can drink the whole pint.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlso eat some pineapple, about an inch and a half.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Eating Rats \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOh, in Thailand if I catch the big rats, they eat them\n\n\r\nI got a tractor finally to clear out some of the jungle and uncovered several big rats nests, big forest rats.\n\n The dogs caught them and they eat them.\n\n Not the dogs eat them, my workers eat them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do they like the rat meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you've got a big rat, it's pretty tasty and it's a wild rat?\n\n It's not a city rat that eats garbage.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow are things going over there in Thailand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn Thailand, they have a raw meat dish, especially up around Shanghai, it's a regular thing that they have a raw meat dish?\n\n I forgot what it's called, but they have a dish that they eat.\n\n It's raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat kind of raw milk do you get over there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBest I can get?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it buffalo.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n No.\n\n Cow.\n\n They imported a lot of cows, from New Zealand.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Eating Schedule For Weight Loss \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanna lose some weight and I'm thinking that I haven't gone over the down diet in a long time and what's a good way to do it\n\n And can you kind of go between the down diet and regular?\n\n You go three days down, then eat a little bit more, and then go alternate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThree days won't do it, you have to go on it four days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, so tell me the whole of what you would suggest.\n\n Now do you have different variations as well.\n\n Cause I heard some different things for different people?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it depends upon the individual, how they digest maybe myself.\n\n\r\nWell, I usually don't do that personal stuff, but we don't have many people, so I'll do it.\n\n\r\n[#1 1/4 teaspoon butter + 1/8 teaspoon honey + 1 - 1.\n\n5 tablespoons cheese]\r\nFirst of all, awake in the morning, just make sure you've got the poisons out because I know you had medication.\n\n So, eat some cheese first, probably only a pea sized amount of honey with it and bean sized amount of butter.\n\n Put the butter and the honey together, it's a very small amount.\n\n Don't put the cheese with the honey with the cheese directly.\n\n The honey goes with the butter and then you eat that.\n\n So, you have about 1/2 teaspoon of butter and honey mixture and then have that with a 1 - 1.\n\n5 tablespoons of cheese to absorb the poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat much cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's a lot of cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're not going to digest it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWill the honey and the butter digest the cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because the honey is so little?\n\n You're only having a pea size amount of honey, it'll be mixed in the pea bean sized amount of butcher So, it's gonna be reacting with the butter.\n\n That's just keep you from getting constipated if you're gonna on the weight loss.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm not having problems.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut are you losing weight.\n\n Because usually you won't lose weight if you're not going?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't know.\n\n I've lost a couple pounds.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat 1/2 teaspoon of butter, honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI said 1/4 teaspoon of butter, 1/8th teaspoon of honey?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, but the thing is that combination of the butter.\n\n If you're gonna eat that with the cheese, isn't that going too still digest it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe honey has to react with the cheese?\n\n If the honey is in the butter, it's not gonna react.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, then that's your first thing you do in the morning.\n\n**[Aajonus],[#2 Golf Ball Size of Patéed Meat]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah?\n\n And then about 15, 20 minutes after that, have a golf ball size of meat and if you want to make sure you lose the weight and you absorb all of meat, then paté the meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo what about thinly slicing the meat, really grind it down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you don't grind it down, you're gonna have to produce a lot of hydrochloric acid?\n\n It's gonna take your energy away from burning fat.\n\n\r\nCause all you need once it's patéed is the bacteria.\n\n**[#3 Sport Drink]**\n\r\nI think the sport drink is the good thing to drink, sip one all day long.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n What about the honey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, just cut the honey down to a tablespoon and you lower the coconut cream to one tablespoon, dairy cream to one tablespoon, but you still put the eggs in it, 2 - 3 eggs?\n\n**[#4 1/2 Cup Milk Before Bed]**\n\r\nWell, I've always told people to have 1/2 cup of milk before you go to sleep on the down diet.\n\n Ah, yeah.\n\n It's in the book.\n\n I also say sip milk throughout the day, but just don't drink a lot at one time.\n\n**[Large marble Size of Meat Every Hour (if not eating eggs)],[Egg Every Hour]**\n\r\nor\r\n\n\r\nThen about every, let's say hour, you have maybe a large marble size if you don't have the egg, you have a large marble size amount of meat every hour.\n\n\r\nIf you're doing the eggs, have an egg every hour.\n\n Well, you need the meat.\n\n If you're having a small amount of meat, you need it all day long, a small amount all day long.\n\n So, you have an egg one hour or every hour and a half.\n\n You wait till you're hungry on the down diet.\n\n \r\nNormally, I never wait til I'm hungry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI was gonna say, I'm not used to that.\n\n So, what if you aren't hungry for three hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, three hours is okay, you don't go over five hours without meat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd if you're working out on the down diet, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine, just remember to sip the sport drink?\n\n\r\nThe book is regimented with bigger sizes of meat, golfball or meatball sizes of meat,  4 - 5 times a day and you're having juice.\n\n But I found that juice makes people too hungry.\n\n It can cause protein deficiency.\n\n So, I think it just eggs and meat, a little bit of milk and sport formula.\n\n\r\nBut you wait till you're hungry each time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if you like the juice.\n\n Can you still do it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's gonna make you hungrier, but you may need it?\n\n You may need the green juice.\n\n I would just cut it down to four ounces at a time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy do you need the green juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSome people may need it cause they're over acidic?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think when I do this, I like doing beef because the beef gives you energy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I eat mainly beef, except when I'm in Philippines, then I mainly eat fish cause I'm right there on the ocean.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you still eat half white and red meat.\n\n\r\nYeah, you can do that?\n\n That's where people were just getting on the diet.\n\n People who were doing the diet for a little time.\n\n It is better balance, but my body's pretty clean, except for these injections.\n\n So, I can go on either meat, it's just if I'm on a down diet I'll eat the red meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm repulsed by chicken for a year or two now.\n\n\r\nThat's all I ate before.\n\n I don't know if it's the quality of the chicken.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlmost all your chickens are fed all processed.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy does the green juice make you hungry.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it provides enzymes for digestive acids and then the body looks for foods to digest?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, stay on that four days, what'd you say to lose weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to stay over four days in a row to be consistent with it?\n\n You could take three days off on something else, but I found you'll gain a lot of it back fast if you only do it three days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I want to lose 40 pounds, just go on the down diet for 30 days straight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I do, yeah?\n\n rid of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you can go straight through it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if you feel like you're getting too intense detoxes, go back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would go back on to a regular diet if I didn't feel well?\n\n So, how long would it take to lose weight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much weight to lose in a week?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can lose probably 8-10 pounds a week?\n\n Other people don't lose it as fast cause they're healthy as I.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you have toxic fat, like I know there's cellulite now that came back, I never saw it before.\n\n\r\nLike you said, it came pushed out to the outside.\n\n That doesn't make you sick when you're coming on the down diet, all the toxins are gonna get released now, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're gonna get released through the skin, so you'll have rashes and hives and things like that?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Fish Hungrier, Not Hungry After 3 Hours, Protein Deficiency, Pate Your Meat, Jar Cleaning \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt depends upon the person\n\n If I eat a lot of fish, I have to eat a tremendous amount.\n\n I'm so hungry, just digests so quickly.\n\n And for some people it isn't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I get hungry quicker on fish for sure too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy so.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou digest it quicker and easier?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat if I eat agood amount of meat, sometimes I get really hungry just after it, like just after 15 minutes later as if I need more and more and more.\n\n But if I don't eat, three hours later I won't be hungry at all for the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause your body's eating your red blood cells.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does that mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBody's eating your red blood cells, not enough proteins, so the body starts eating red blood cells, himself?\n\n \r\nOnce you start eating your own blood cells, you become too acidic.\n\n Meats repulsive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's calling him to eat his own blood cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProtein Deficiency.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n That was protein deficiency.\n\n Can you say that again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen you have a protein deficiency, your body starts eating its own red blood cells for protein?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy would I have a protein deficiency if I just had a meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou may already be protein deficient?\n\n \r\nIf you're very protein deficient, which I can see you are because your body wants a lot more mass on there.\n\n The more muscle, the more fat you can store.\n\n Right now, you don't have enough muscle.\n\n .\n\n All right, so when your body gets to meat, it says, oh, I like this.\n\n Let's have more.\n\n But you still have a digestive problem, so you've got a problem there, so you have to work that out.\n\n \r\nYou work that out by having a little honey and a little pineapple to help digestion, okay.\n\n Of the meats?\n\n Once you don't eat anything, then your blood protein level drops to a point where the body says, I have to eat my own red blood.\n\n That causes a tremendous amount of overacidity and then that causes you to lose your appetite, cause of anorexia.\n\n\r\nSo, if you grind your meat all the way, you're not likely to get hungry, if you grind it into a paté.\n\n If it's just normally ground, it's likely to be homogenized and it's not going to digest well and you're still gonna be hungry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not going to digest well because it's been grounded.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen it's grounded to a very fine paste, your body doesn't have to use any digestive acids, only bacteria is needed to infiltrate?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBacteria is 90% of digestion?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, but how do you make it like a fine paste.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what I do is I take the steak and I'll cut it into cubes about 1\" x 1\", put it in my food processor, only fill my food processor halfway and then grind that in there until it's a paté?\n\n\r\nAnd I'll make enough for 2 - 3 days sometime.\n\n Stuff it in a two cup jar.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoes it stay okay that way.\n\n Better than leaving it whole?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbout the same?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt's a lot of work because I do it every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I do it every 2 - 3 days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI don't have to wash the food processer so much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nExactly.\n\n\r\nIt doesn't take much time to clean the food processor.\n\n You figure we're getting pretty lazy when we've gone from hours of cooking and cooking and scrubbing pots to just a few minutes of cleaning your food processor.\n\n This is the height of laziness.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAlmost an hour each day washing canning jars.\n\n\r\nWell, that's a day's worth of canning jars usually takes me a an hour by the time I do every, well not quite an hour.\n\n Maybe about 30 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo clean how many.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nUsually about 18 - 20, along with forks and tops every day and the food processor, and then the, the jars that you store your food in, you keep emptying them out so that they're part of the jars?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI clean as soon as I finish to get it outta the way.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, I can't do that cuz I'm eating this stuff on the road often, but also working.\n\n\r\nI collect them, then I wash them once a day and use your special formula of coconut cream and apple cider vinegar and salt, it cleans much better.\n\n And then that way I don't have to get hot water every, every time I need to do one jar, I get the hot water all at once.\n\n\r\nIt just makes a lot of sense, use a lot less water.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Green Pastures Cod Liver Oil, Dit D In Dairy \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the cod liver, there's only one other cod liver oil that's good\n\n I worked for them for two years to produce that awful, nasty, bitter tasting cod liver oil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGreen Pastures.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's fermented, but it has no flavor to it?\n\n Those that have flavoring is just processed oils that have been distilled and treated with kerosene.\n\n\r\nSo, you have to get the stinky, bitter one.\n\n It's excellent.\n\n \r\nIf you're eating fish regularly and you're not eating junk food, this's not going to do anything benefit for you.\n\n\r\nI tested on many, many people on this diet and there was no advantage.\n\n If you're on a shit diet it will or you're not getting any sunshine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI took this oil and my head started shrinking like I had such headache and pain in my neck and everything.\n\n\r\nIs that like allergies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Cleaning out the brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I should take more.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wouldn't do it?\n\n I'd do it slowly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI should keep taking it slowly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I'd just eat the diet and you will normally detox your brain slowly?\n\n Yeah, I wouldn't eat that.\n\n As long as you're on the diet, if you're, let's say 80% on the diet, I wouldn't eat any cod liver, unless you're eating something really nasty like fried foods.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if I'm in Canada and there's no sun and nothing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll help, but your milk has a lot of vitamin d in it and your butter?\n\n\r\nOh, you can't get it at all.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou can't go to a

to digest more food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Digest more food with honey, honey's enzymes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but I'm saying why am I putting weight on by eating the honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust what I said?\n\n You're digesting more food, you're digesting more fats.\n\n Everything you put it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but I'm saying I'm eating extra honey, so I'm putting more weight on.\n\n Not from the honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're digesting the other foods better because you're eating so much, honey?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I see.\n\n So, if I eat, if I less honey, do you think I'd lose the weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot necessarily?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI tried that, It doesn't work.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So, the food that I'm eating, I'm using it more.\n\n So, therefore I'm putting weight on because of the food.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Hot Water Bottles, Muscle Recipe \n \n \n \n \n### (18) Ideal Body Fat \n

15%.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about a man.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey say men, anywhere from 10% - 12%?\n\n I keep mine at least 20% - 21.\n\n% Couple of times I've gone down to 18%.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Juice Fast, Weight Loss, Ideal Weights \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause so many of the detoxes I did before the Primal Diet were like juice fasting, so you would all get sick the first few days\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm never a juice faster.\n\n I don't tell anybody to juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I did that before I met you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what happens on a juice fast is you keep getting lower on fat and protein.\n\n\r\nThen when you are hungry, you just start overeating and then right back where you were.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it okay to lose 20 or 30 pounds.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou could use lose 20, 30 pounds?\n\n That'd be all right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause you're getting rid of the old stuff, that's fine.\n\n You don't have to repeat everythig and gain it.\n\n\r\nHow many times do you tell a person has to go up and down?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust in the recipe book?\n\n I told everybody to do it every six months because a lot of people are paranoid that they had to wait a long time, they'd start worrying about it every day, but if they know they lose it every six months and they won't worry about it.\n\n\r\nBut I like to tell people who are confident and don't worry about it.\n\n Let's stay there for two and a half years and then let the body go into a flue and take it off.\n\n Don't force it.\n\n\r\nSo, I never had to force mine.\n\n What's the first time ever really.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's okay also just to carry it forever even?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI guess I thought the purpose of a down diet was to detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're going have certain fats that bind certain poisons while they're moving out of the body.\n\n \r\nWhen I went back to Asia that last time I had holes.\n\n \r\nWell, you never saw me sitting without a shirt on.\n\n\r\nI don't go shirtless when I look like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou has that washboard belly like about two years ago you took your shirt off at the potluck.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's when I'm on my thin side, but when I'm on my full side and I'm full.\n\n It's amazing.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou don't look like 180 now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm 182.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, are you gonna do the down diet with me.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nYeah, you'll be skin and bones if you go down?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI need to lose at least, 10   - 15.\n\n I'd say about 15 pounds.\n\n So, I'm 150.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd how tall are you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI think I'm 5' 5\"?\n\n And I just said, whose bottom is that.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nDid you say 150?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #3],[male]**\n\r\nYou're more than me \n.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI think I've been having too much honey in my formulas.\n\n I think I need to reduce the honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut still, 5' 5\", you shouldn't be under 140.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's a good one for 5' 4\".\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbout 135 minimum?\n\n**[Scott]**\n\r\nWhat about 5' 10\".\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor a guy, you should be up to almost 200 pounds?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's got 50 pounds to go.\n\n**[Scott]**\n\r\nBut I've never been able to put any weight in my whole life.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHave you been doing the dairy.\n\n**[Scott]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou'll start putting it on long.\n\n No, when he gets closer to the 6th and 7th year, he'll start putting.\n\n \r\nBecause I never put it on and all, all of a sudden it's like, I have big fat and I just put it on now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes turning 50 have a part.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNot the 50, just the menopause?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're on a shit diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut your metabolic weight slows down too, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they just have so many toxins collecting at that age, when they go into menopause, the body needs to detoxify?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it holds fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n It's collecting the fat because it's not dumping the poisons, but you go to keep going into heat flashes to perspire it out, but those heat flashes don't work very much?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not really the hormones fluctuating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's the toxins trying to get rid of the toxins and putting them out the skin?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, the hormones though are gonna come lower, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you're still building as many, you're making as many?\n\n You're just using it to attach to toxins cause hormones are 60% fat or more, 68% fat.\n\n\r\nSo, your body uses the hormones to bind with the poisons, so it isn't you.\n\n Just because you find a lower ratio of them in your blood that doesn't mean you're not making a lot of them.\n\n \r\nSee, all they find, \"Oh, it's lower in the blood, therefore your body's not making the hormones\", and it's a lie.\n\n\r\nThe body's using it because now the liver's breaking down, it's not making the fats properly to harness with the toxins to feed the lymphatic system to clean the body, so the body starts using its hormones for purpose.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy would the body, in my case, put on weight because of the honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you were able to digest and?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Milk Clubs In Canada \n \nmilk\r\nfood

Honey will destroy it too.\n\n \r\nYou can wash it down with milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou have to eat it as just honey.\n\n And then you rinse your mouth with milk and spit out the milk.\n\n \r\nYou've gotta meat as it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can take the milk down a little bit.\n\n Alittle bit slower than digestion.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIf you rinse the chicken, does that make it no longer high chicken.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're not gonna have all the outer bacteria?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's a good way to work into it, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, my thing is I've gotta be in an environment where I don't have people, that's the problem?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Muscle Pain, Lactic Acid \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd that's for the muscle\n\n What about the joints.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat would be a constant pain, not just cramping?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Constant pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBone marrow.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbout two ounces of bone marrow?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThroughout the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, all at once?\n\n You're always trying to second guess what I'm going to say.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSorry.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nStop and listen.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAlright.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, 2 oz of bone marrow with about 2 oz of butter and about a teaspoon of pineapple juice.\n\n\r\nYou take a chunk of pineapple and squeeze a tablespoon of juice from that.\n\n \r\nAnd if it's real bad, while you're eating that, take a slice and put it over that joint very thin, and then cover that with a moist gauss and cover that with a piece of plastic and then put a H-bandage around it and you put a hot water bottle or two next to that joint at night.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nConnective tissue.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHot baths, and whey?\n\n \r\nAlso any of the sport drinks.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how does the sport drink work, its benefit.\n\n What is it about the sport drink?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on what you use in it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the one you gave us last time, is that just the standard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I'm saying it depends on what you use in it and the different combination?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n See, because the combinations, there's the standard, which is just the tomato, cucumber, and all the other stuff.\n\n That's the standard.\n\n Then there's the other one is, watermelon, and cucumber.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd tomato.\n\n That's what I mean.\n\n You can use any.\n\n So, you can have like eight combinations or more.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is the sport drink for dryness or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's for a lot of things?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, give us a few things.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it helps rehydrate the body cause you can absorb 100% of the H20 in all different types of tissue if you have tomato and the cucumber together.\n\n \r\nIf you have watermelon, that's gonna have a tendency to cleanse and hydrate the intestines more, and mucus membrane and the connective tissue.\n\n\r\nIf you have whey and cucumber, it like would be mostly joints and connective tissue, and it will clear lactic acid from the muscles.\n\n\r\nLactic acid, byproduct of metabolism.\n\n\r\nWhey and tomato be joints also, also nerves.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith all the other stuff too or just those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, just two?\n\n These are the different ones.\n\n Let's say you add two cups of tomato, one cup of whey, or 1.\n\n5 cups of tomato and 1.\n\n5 cups of way.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Nausea, Vingar, Sports Drink \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNausea is almost always the process of something going into the stomach, whether you're eating it or whether it's coming from the body, dumping into the stomach, body forms hydrochloric acid to neutralize those poisons\n\n \r\nIf those are not neutralized, you have to vomit them.\n\n \r\nIf you have something in there to help neutralize that besides hydrochloric acid, vinegar helps.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, whatever combination you have in the sports drink, when you add a little bit of apple cider vinegar to it, it just assists the- \r\n\n\r\nThat's why I have always have vinegar in there, depending upon the person.\n\n Sometimes I'll recommend people have two tablespoons, but most always it's just one tablespoon and that dispersed through the whole quart even and enough to take care.\n\n\r\nHowever, most of the time I say if you have nausea, you eat cheese to absorb the poisons.\n\n Don't worry about neutralizing, absorb them, so you'd be sure they don't get recycled.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's the difference between eating cucumbers and tomatoes by themselves.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it's a huge difference?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, when you get to that point where you know what you want, does that mean you know what you're doing to some extent with your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you get the results you want, yes?\n\n If you're not getting the results you want, then no.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, I don't know what I'm doing, I just know good body wants it and it feels good after I eat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's why I say you gotta read the books, sometimes you don't know remember.\n\n Well, I talk about all those things in the book.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what does eating the cucumbers and tomatoes, compared to blending to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you blend them together, you've got a formula that will disperse evenly all over and do the same thing?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, it is?\n\n When you're eating them separately, you're gonna have isolated things, getting certain areas.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) No Lemon With Red Meat \n \n \n \n \n### (25) Over Acidic Blood \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYour blood protein drops to the point where your body has to eat its own red blood cells to get the protein and that causes over acidity and nausea, which is anorexia\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd to get rid of the acidity and the nausea.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVegetable juice is helpful for that, some fruit?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny of the fruit?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlkanizing substances?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike eat just fruit by itself or in the mixture with cow cream and coconut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny way you want?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n And then when the over acidity is neutralized with the vegetable juices and fruit, then he slowly gets back into trying to eat the meat to build up the system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you just have the pineapple, that should do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'll neutralize the acidity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNeutralize the acidity, and keep digestingthe meat at the same?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nLemon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot with red meat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Sipping Milk Throughout Day, Cream Hard To Digest, Not Digesting Meat, Cooked Mea,t Hydroclhoric Acid \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI usually drink 8 ounces when I drink it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI only do maybe two ounces at a time.\n\n Then I do that about every 30 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nDidn't you say sipping milk throughout the day has some benefit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou digest it better; your body handles it better?\n\n No backup, there's no slow down.\n\n Yeah.\n\n So, what I do is I sip about 1 oz, 1.\n\n5 - 2 oz at a time.\n\n Then I do that about every 30 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd what's the benefit of that.\n\n What was that specific?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI just had said, it digests better?\n\n You handle everything better, easier.\n\n Nothing backs up.\n\n nothing is overloaded.\n\n Yeah.\n\n What happens.\n\n It's the overload, right?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, what happens, I remember in the past when Joseph and I were talking about milk?\n\n Every time I drink you the milk, whether it's the six ounces of the eight ounces or more, I get sleepy.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, why does it make you sleepy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause the cream is very difficult to digest, especially when it's mixed with the other milk?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you kind of shut down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, your body just has to spend all this energy on digestion?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI just got sleepy from having a little tiny bit of cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's unusual.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIt could be just that time of the day, the afternoon's that time, especially with this weather, you just wanna cuddle up and go to sleep.\n\n**[Scott]**\n \r\n\r\nIs it okay to drink milk with food.\n\n Do you have milk with food, or should you have it separate?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you have milk with food, it should be a very small amount?\n\n**[Scott]**\n \r\n\r\nAlways sip it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBetter, yeah?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen I have a meat meal, I'll have a tablespoon to rinse my mouth, but I won't touch it for another 20 -30 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, drink milkshakes the same way.\n\n Two ounces at a time?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n It's always better.\n\n 2 oz at a time every 10, 15 minutes or every 5 minutes, you do two ounces every 5 minutes of a milkshake.\n\n Unless you want to take a long time to drink it, take an hour to drink it that's okay.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you have, let's say a 16-ounce milkshake, then over a period of an hour, if you had two ounces at a time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you drink that all at once, that's way too much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I mean if you have milkshake all one time like that,I would just go to sleep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI can have eight ounces all at one time, but not sixteen.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, in that hour, you're sipping that milkshake and nothing else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat was, what was your question for Aajonus.\n\n**[Scott]**\n \r\n\r\nIt was about milk?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, take advantage.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Like when you eat raw meat, what would be a good portion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHow much meat at a time?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI usually have 1/2 pound, 1.\n\n5 cups.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's a lot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDidn't say something about ground up meat oxidizes or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends on how it's ground?\n\n If it's ground under high pressure the fat is homogenized and then homogenized fat encapsulates the protein and you don't digest it very well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI feel like I digest the ground beef better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but usually stores grind it through a high-pressure grinder twice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I feel how often when I eat meat, it stays in my stomach more than cooked meat \r\n\r\nWhich I find strange because I should be able to digest it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nJust means you have no hydrochloric acid in your stomach.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThen what do you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSee, when you have cooked meat, it'll just flake off and fall apart and dissolve?\n\n In your intestine, raw does not, unless you have hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow do you get that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBeets, corn, pineapple?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBeets have hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey hydrochloric acid precursors?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, eating raw meat won't give this hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends on how toxic your stomach lining is, sounds like your stomach lining is pretty dark?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's pretty bad.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if he eats pineapple with his meat, how much pineapple.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot much?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nPineapple makes me swell, like my mouth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nMine even bled once.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, you're only supposed to eat a small piece at a time.\n\n \r\n\r\nMine will last two weeks.\n\n What you do is you cut it in circles like this, small circle.\n\n And then you put it down in a bowl, so it's down in a bowl like this and it seats itself and it stays fine.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, when you take it out, let's say you've gone three days without having any.\n\n You take about a 16th of an inch slice off, throw it away, and take your slice off of that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut that's still a lot.\n\n If you take a slice like that, there's still a lot of pineapple on there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, that's too much.\n\n It's a small, I'm not saying that thick.\n\n \r\n\r\nLet's say you're taking a slice off, okay, to get a cube of pineapple like that.\n\n You just take a thin slice about an 1/8\" and that's all you eat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIt could be there forever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot if you're doing that two, three times a day, even four times a day, taking a little thin slice for.\n \n \n \n### (27) Syrup Fed Honey, Aajonus Farm \n \n \n \n \n### (28) Taking High Chicken To Movie Theatre \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen I used to go to the movie theater I would take high chicken with me\n\n\r\nThe reason I did is cuz everybody was using these perfumes and colognes with formaldehyde in it and I couldn't go into a movie theater anymore.\n\n If I wanted to go to movie theater, I would take my chicken legs and I mean, they would rank, I'd leave them out the day before.\n\n They were already high in the refrigerator and they would just be so bad.\n\n\r\nI like the smell and I would pull that out and you just, two rows in front, all the way on the side and two rows in back, clear out.\n\n \r\nWell, I was reported one time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe're supposed to buy the stuff that's in the movie now, $6 for a little candy bar\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Termites \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI would tape all the doors on the inside, but the last one you go out\n\n I would tape that one after I go out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow serious is termite killing  medication, what does it do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf the body decides to throw it there, body puts it in a non weak place, then it won't be so bad?\n\n And if you have fats there, it's not gonna be so bad.\n\n And if you put it in a weak place or a place where it's very fat deficient, It's gonna have some damage that kills cells that cause more toxicity in the area that can damage every cell, every time that it offgases.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI looked up the cedar oil once and it seems to me that there was two kinds, one water based or oil based.\n\n Have you ever seen anything like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, there's a water based one?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhich ones should I be buying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would buy the oil based one?\n\n They say neither has any VOCS in it, volatile organic compounds in any Cedar product, however, I tried the water soluble one and usually oil is more toxic, more compounds in it.\n\n But the water soluble one seemed to give me a headache, and the oil soluble one did not.\n\n\r\nAnd the water soluble one lasted for weeks.\n\n Oil soluble one, because I think it was absorbed better into the wood, it only lasted about three or four days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou mean the order.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOdor can still be heavy?\n\n Cause those are still oil vapors.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the water, the water vapor lasted a lot longer, is that what you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Cause there was some other chemical in it, that chemical was not a good chemical.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Thai Women and Prostitutes \n \n \n \n \n### (31) Types Of Clay To Eat, Fast Metabolism and Leaky Gut \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRecommending Terramin Clay or Terrasilk Clay for eating\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends upon the individual?\n\n If they have a high metabolism and they're an athlete, they should be eating Terramin.\n\n They're very slow, low energy.\n\n \r\nBarbara Morgan is a high energy person, she should not be having the Terrasilk.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's the difference.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne coarser than the other?\n\n Terrasilk is very fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's a lot more expensive too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the Terrasilk being fine is for the people with low energy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSlow digestion?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSlow digestion, how does that affect- I'm trying to understand what the difference is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the people who are slower digestion need a finer molecule to help pull stuff out of the blood out of the intestine.\n\n \r\nThe people who have a high metabolism where everything is moving fast, they need a more coarse one, or else they may absorb some of those fine toxic molecules.\n\n\r\nClay is a rock.\n\n It's not a substance, it's not a food.\n\n**[unclear]**\n gets absorbed into the body.\n\n \r\nIf you're a hyperactive person, then you've got a high metabolism.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat if you're both.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're both, then you could use either?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, when you are on the low end, then you should be having the silk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd the thing is, if you eat the wrong kind and it's absorbing in your body, it's going to be damaging you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It'll be heavy metal toxicity.\n\n \r\nRock does not digest in the human body and, but sometimes, because I tell you to soak it and leave it a long time, you've got bacteria in there that will break it down even further to just help pull poisons out faster.\n\n \r\nBut some people who have high metabolism have huge pores in their intestines, and even those things can pass out.\n\n It'll never get into a cell, but it can get into the blood, it can get into the neurological fluid and cause complication.\n\n \r\nIt could cause rashes, it could cause nausea, it could cause headaches, loss of appetite, too much hunger; can go anyway.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Used To Go To The Bathroom More, Vegetarians Not Digesting, Toxins In Food \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI remember when I was a lot leaner, I was always going to the bathroom\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, me too.\n\n I don't go as much anymore.\n\n I don't go as much anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I was a fruitarian, Vegetarian I'd do five or six times a day.\n\n Now on Primal Diet, one time a day, sometimes one time every two days.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOr just having a bowel movement too.\n\n Is that part toxicity every hour.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf it's a diarrhea, that's toxicity?\n\n \r\nBut if they're going every hour, the body's not digesting their food and something in their food like a food coloring or a fragrance that goes into a food, make it smell good, any of those can be highly toxic.\n\n Cause them to have regular bowel movements several times a day.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, when you started assimilating, all of a sudden your food is digesting, is that cause the organs are healthier.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBacteria's high in the intestines?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAll the bacteria or specific bacteria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll of it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow does the bacteria get high.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n How do you increase.\n\n So, now why are we having more bacteria?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause you're not taking all the poisons and also you're eating the cheese regularly?\n\n You're absorbing poisons so they don't damage of the colon.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDid you talk about it in that class.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because I didn't understand all of it at that time and now of course I give the lectures different?\n\n Eat the cheese that will absorb every hour, every 30 minutes, depending on how toxic the person lives.\n\n Eat a little piece of cheese, get a train of it going through to collect the poison sand that will prevent the toxins from lowering the bacterial levels.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOh, so the toxins lower the bacteria levels.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey kill bacteria?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n And eating the cheese throughout the day raises the bacteria in the gut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnly because it grabs onto the poisons?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd what are the poisons specifically.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on what they are?\n\n If you're eating processed food, like I said, it could be anything from any additive: could be coloring, it could be flavoring, it could be a fragrance.\n\n like a lot of the stuff that smells like strawberries.\n\n It's not at all strawberry anything, it's actually ester chemical that they made from petroleum.\n\n \r\nSo, those kind of things get into the system, get into the tissue, and even if you're not eating them now, they were in your body.\n\n When your body throws 'em off, dissolves the fat that they were harnessed in or encapsulated in, sets them free again, they can poison all the bacteria in the intestine.\n\n\r\nAnd if it's really toxic, your body will either vomit or have diarrhea to get rid of it.\n\n If you have the cheese going through regularly, small amounts of the cheese going through regularly, it collects those poisons as long as you don't eat the honey directly with the cheese, and as long as it's raw, no salt cheese.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, just everybody to eat small pieces of cheese all the time during the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI've never found them cheeses.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, Amos Miller and some of those Amish farmers that have on their product list willl actually ship them to.\n\n\r\nYou have to do a FedEx, you can't do it post office.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Weight Gain and Loss and Aajonus Height, Detoxing Without Extra Fat \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo assist, you put on the extra 10, 15 pounds\n\n Then when you are detoxing, whether it's with the cilantro juices or whatever formulas you give, you're supposed to in that day, eat the butter, the cheese, the cream, the coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDaily.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that the formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n15 pounds I would say is minimum?\n\n I like people to go 20, 25 pounds.\n\n If they're over 5' 4\", they should be going 20 pounds overweight.\n\n \r\nMy bottom is about 163 lbs now, but I'll go all the way up to 192.\n\n\r\nSo, I go 30 pounds.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's your height.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n5' 7\" 3/4?\n\n\" I've been 5' 7\" 3/4\" since I was 16.\n\n5 years old.\n\n All my family is shrunken and shrunken and shrunken, I've stayed.\n\n\r\nThe last time I did it I was actually 1/16th of an inch taller.\n\n So, I'm just slightly above the 5' 7\" 3/4\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow did you get the extra height.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI think that I just started growing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you don't have a reserve, you're gonna have a lot more symptoms, you're gonna suffer more and you're not gonna get very well.\n\n\r\nYou're not gonna detoxify properly and you're gonna damage tissue in your body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that extra cushion of fat absorbs the toxicity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So, is that why back then when I was detoxing and I didn't have the extra fat on, that it went into the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but it probably went into other cells, not just the bone marrow?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat other cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny cells in your body where the poison went?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe toxicity went in the cells, like you talking about like the liver maybe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on where it was coming out and what was the local site.\n\n If it came out of the liver, it may go right back into the liver.\n\n Other cells that had fat, but it would be looking for the fat inside the cell, so it would go into the cell and destroy the fat inside the cell, so then the cell is weaker or even dies, or is maimed in some way.\n\n\r\nSo, that cell won't function anymore.\n\n\r\nThat's why it's very important to have excess fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, in the bone marrow of the body, that's where the red white blood cells are made and get their energy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey divide in the bone marrow, they mature in the bone marrow, and then once they mature they enter the bloodstream?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, if they enter the bloodstream, immature, not with enough oxygen, then you're going-\r\n\n\r\nYou're red blood cells take oxygen from the lungs and take them to the cells, but when a cell is bred in a toxic bone marrow, it's going to be affected.\n\n It's not going to be as strong, let's say that it's a red blood cell, it won't be able to carry as much to oxygen, it'll have a lot more toxic byproducts that it excretes.\n\n  \r\nThen the white blood cells are supposed to eat all of that.\n\n If they're toxic, they're gonna get nauseous and they can't eat as much, so they won't be able to keep the blood as clean.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAfter the down diet, does your body hurt from toxicity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on how far down you go?\n\n I've seen people go beyond where they're supposed to go.\n\n \r\nLet's say they've been 15 pounds overweight and they go below the 15 pounds, they're gonna have some problems.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNow, when you say overweight, like you said 5' 4\", is that according to the primal diet weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt would be what the typical chart would say?\n\n Typically someone who is 5' 4\" the average weight would be 123 lbs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Whey \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is special about the whey\n\n \r\nCause there must be something special about it cause it's in the sports drinks?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it has a tendency to turn vinegar and will be more cleansing, can help dissolve mineral buildups, it can help dissolve lactic acid buildups, crystallizations.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat if you don't want it in there, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't use it?\n\n It's okay.\n\n \r\nLike I said, you can use four different things, you don't have to have whey at all.\n\n You have watermelon, tomato and cucumber.\n\n You could have cucumber and tomato, you could have watermelon and tomato, you could have watermelon and cucumber.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSometimes a food repulses me.\n\n So, is that not a normal instinct to pick the right thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, maybe something that you know is going to detox you too fast?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSomething better smelling or tasting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you need to put something in at the counteract that, that's usually with the vinegar?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat does that mean.\n\n Vinegar counteracts the detoxing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n It helps take care of the detoxing, so it isn't extreme.\n\n It will help neutralize poisons to the point where they don't make you so Ill.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

starting to leave, and my left hand has been one barometer I use to determine how effective the program was\n\n I'm now starting to get pain of all the toxins that I had before I started the program, all this stuff's coming back and it's going away.\n\n I had this area right here, it got dehydrated and it turned into the leather , for about three weeks, and now I feel the pain there.\n\n It's starting to rehydrated, and so all this whole hand is start transform itself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it takes 40 years to clean all the cells out of the body, toxicity out of the body, 40 years according to Howell's and Pottenger's work.\n\n Took five generations to get to healthy, five generations of cells is 7 - 7.\n\n5 years for the entire body's cells, especially the bones.\n\n\r\nSo, five times that's about 37.\n\n5 years.\n\n So, it takes about 40 years for us to clean out completely if we're 100%.\n\n\r\nWell, I've got another 16 years to go.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat  happens.\n\n You become or younger or more healthy?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, every day I get healthier?\n\n It's just, it's gonna take that long for me to have all the toxins out my system, and you can still see the mercury from this incision and the injections still coming out.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajons Thin Cuz Eating Raw Fat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPeople say, well, you're pretty skinny\n\n Well, I'm thin because I've been eating raw foods since 1972.\n\n So, the fat molecules, when they're raw are very small, very powerful, very concentrated.\n\n  \r\nWhen you cook a fat, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size guess.\n\n  \r\nLook at this.\n\n I have a little bit, not much, tight legs, no fat appearing anywhere else, but a little bit right here.\n\n You know what my body fat level is.\n\n Normally people, when they're men and they're my size what do you think that that level normally is?\n\n  \r\nYes, that's right?\n\n 7% to 15%, usually 7% to 12%.\n\n \r\nI am 22% body fat.\n\n So, I'm really bigger than he is if I had cooked foods, cooked fat molecules still in my body, I'd be about his size.\n\n He's about 22% to 27% body fat.\n\n So, that's what I would look like if I still had old swollen fat, cooked fat molecules in my body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDidn't they say you're supposed to be around that 7%.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAthletes say that for performance?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs that true.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nt's not true at all?\n\n I've got athletes who when they go on the diet, they take all this time off and they gain 5% to 10% bodyfat.\n\n It's the quality of fat that's important and the concentration, you can get so many more fat molecules into a small space if they're raw.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Being Poisoned By Government \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm getting harassed and poisoned by the government, and I'm afraid to say it looks like it's happening\n\n Had my house broken into twice, nothing missing.\n\n \r\nAlso, I've got the telephone number and a telephone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you know they broke into it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause when I'm going away just to make sure that nobody's in my house, and sometimes when I leave, you can take a piece of hair and you glue it, and nothing could break that if it's a certain type of hair, unless the door's been open and twice it's been open, and nothing's missing?\n\n\r\nComputer, I can see it's been played with, so I know that they are starting to watch me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat are you gonna do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I'll die if they kill me?\n\n I'm just gonna try to get all my work done in the next two years, so if I die everybody will have everything that I know.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhy would they break in.\n\n You have the right to write what you want?\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nThat's why so did Kennedy from going against the system.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWas it because of me with the chemtrails?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's been since the chemtrail incident, since I got my face in that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're watching all, all of us as well.\n\n That's all your fault.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI doubt that they're watching.\n\n .\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou can just drop out now, if you don't wanna be a part of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShit, I faced death so many times I'm not afraid of death.\n\n\r\nDeath does not concern me, but while I'm alive, I wanna be healthy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Antiobiotics and Bacteria \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou've destroyed your intestinal environment, you've destroyed the bacteria, you've destroyed E coli\n\n E coli is responsible for the final stage of digestion.\n\n It is the bacteria that synthesizes most of the B vitamins, included vitamin B12 from meats.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you do enemas with colonics or antibiotics, you had reduced your immunity to everything and your strength and backup.\n\n \r\nSo, E coli is very important.\n\n The E coli also discharges veratoxin enzymes, which prevent and dissolve brain tumors.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bell Peppers, Vit C Burns Fat \n \n \n \n \n### (6) Berries For Metals \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can use it with any fruits you desire, you've emphasized berries in the past\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's not what I said, I said dark berries for heavy metals, the lighter metals like aluminum and iodine using raspberries is good to eliminate, raspberries and coconut cream helps eliminate that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou use the sports formula with coconut cream and blend it with some raspberries.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n\r\nWell, it depends.\n\n I give people specific recipes.\n\n I'm giving you a general, when I give it to somebody it's specific.\n\n I'll give them three quarters of a tablespoon of butter and maybe a table of spoon and a half of cream or a half a tablespoon of cream and a tablespoon and half a butter.\n\n\r\nIt depends upon their digestibility, but I'm just giving you a ballpark area to play with.\n\n  a ballpark area that you won't hurt yourself.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Best EMF Earbuds \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, as long as you're not on a call, it's not going to be sending radiation into your body\n\n So, whenever I get a call, I've got an ear plug and the phone goes somewhere else.\n\n I do not touch that phone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot in your pocket because then it gets in your genitals.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'll go right all through your hip bone and cause cancer down there\r\n\n\r\nSpeakerphones?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSpeakerphone would be fine too?\n\n You're not touching it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about the Bluetooth ones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBluetooth are nasty?\n\n Right up into your head.\n\n It's not the battery.\n\n It's the radioactive signal.\n\n So, even even a cordless phone, if it's over 900 megahertz, if it's a two gigahertz, your radiation level's a 4.\n\n\r\nSo, I don't even use a cordless phone in my house that's over 900 megahertz.\n\n\r\nAlmost all of 'em are 2.\n\n22 to 2.\n\n5 gigahertz, instead of megahertz.\n\n I bought a whole slew of them and I have 'em in my storage cause they don't make the light ones anymore.\n\n You may find them on eBay or something like that, but you have to search.\n\n Or go to Hong Kong and get them out of a store there.\n\n\r\nCause they still have them in Hong Kong.\n\n I just bought something in Hong Kong that had low megahertz that they don't make in this country anymore.\n\n Don't sell in this country, but they do sell in the Asia.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Bird Flu & Swine Flu \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs everybody worried about the Avion flu\n\n

out of 200 people in the whole world that have contracted it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOut of 6 billion people *laughs*.\n\n It's just like the swine flu, if people remember in the 70s.\n\n Rockefeller was our vice president, the owner of five pharmaceutical houses, and we paid his company $7 billion to make the swine flu.\n\n\r\nConsumer advocate and Doctor McBean an MD from San Diego filed suit for Ford, Rockefeller and the federal government for buying and issuing those vaccines, and it got tht news reporters at the polling places, cause they were giving it to people \"free\" with our tax dollars, $7 billion worth.\n\n 2300 people died in the first week, within three days of getting the vaccine, so it got shut down and it's still in the vault.\n\n \r\nSo, guess what's getting relabeled, the swine flu vaccine and they resold it again.\n\n $8 billion we paid for it this time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd of course it's because of the mercury.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah.\n\n  Mercury, and aluminum.\n\n Don't they, is it coming from this?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat is it called?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTamiflu is what it's called?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nRoseville owns that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, absolutely.\n\n Well, you know, it's part of it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI'm surprised they didn't turn it into a chemtrail.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe birds are getting sick from those sprays too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll birds have a flu if they're raised in toxic environments.\n\n Pigeons have a lot of flu because they grew up in cities eating cooked bread and stuff like that.\n\n So, they don't utilize bacteria, just like we do.\n\n We don't utilize bacteria as well.\n\n The contaminants in the food, the pesticides, the herbicides that are in food damage the bacteria in our bodies so that we can't cleanse ourselves in the normal process.\n\n\r\nSo what happens.\n\n We have to resort to flus, uh, which are viruses?\n\n Viruses are solvents, their soaps that clean the body.\n\n So, they don't reduce contamination, they spread contamination.\n\n So, unless you have a very good diet, any kind of a viral detoxification is going to be difficult.\n\n\r\nSo, don't worry about Avion flu.\n\n It's just another hoax to get us to spend 8 billion, so they can stuff it in their pockets, which they did.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut if they spray from the chemtrails, let's say an example, the birds are flying up, they inhale that spray.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnything that causes pollution is going to make birds and everybody else sick.\n\n\r\nSo, that's part of the damage that causes the bacteria and parasites to be destroyed, so we don't have the natural processes of cleansing.\n\n \r\nSo, in the last three weeks, I decided to do a heavy cleanse.\n\n Sulfur is a nutrient when it's high in a food to get some of the heavy metals out of the body.\n\n If you understand cancer, they say that when you're in the throes of cancer beyond the 3rd stage or 4th stage, you'll start demineralizing your own tissue, and your own bones.\n\n You'll start getting osteoporosis because your body needs so much calcium and the other minerals in a good balance to bind with those poisons.\n\n\r\nSo, since I had chemotherapy and radiation, and I still get experiences of detoxing about every 18 months to about 30 months, 34 months, I'd have a detox.\n\n So, I thought, well, I've got a whole month in town, so I decided to do it.\n\n \r\nSo, I put a half of cup of honey and two quarts of milk, and I'd been drinking that a day.\n\n Within a week of beginning that, I started getting all of these hives and started crusting and turning black and look at it under a microscope, I can see the different compounds that they use.\n\n \r\nThey used mercurochrome during my stomach surgery, so that was coming out.\n\n I've got a black spot right here that burned, I had a hole right in it right there, and I do the scrapings and then look at it under a microscope.\n\n So, I've got it coming out everywhere I got injections, on the butt, the arms and anywhere they coated me with the mercury on the stomach during surgery.\n\n\r\nBut there were a lot of them.\n\n This is just one of them, and they will just pop out within a few hours.\n\n If you understand what happens with mercury, if you go to the website of Calgary University, they did a DVD and they showed neurons growing and all dispersing and growing, it's a time lapse photography.\n\n And then you drop a 2% solution of thimerosal into that, and then you see that the neurons disintegrate and that's what happens when it comes out through the skin or internally it can cause internal bleeding, it can cause many problems.\n\n\r\nEvery vaccine contains 76,000 trillion molecules of mercury.\n\n 96% of all vaccines have thimerosal, which is mercury.\n\n So, you can imagine how much of that is in your body if you've had a lot of vaccines, even tetanus shots, antibiotics like penicillin, all have mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde, and that's just some of the base chemicals in them.\n\n\r\nThe reason for that is, people say, well, why did they do that.\n\n They put on it as a purification system, and antibacterial?\n\n Like you put methylated mercurochrome on yourself, methylated mercurochrome is a liquid mercury.\n\n \r\nIodine is another one that will destroy things, it's very caustic and burns.\n\n So, they use it because it shocks the body into trauma.\n\n Every animal that Pasteur injected died.\n\n He didn't ever have one in his laboratory survive a vaccine, not one survived a vaccine.\n\n But there was so much potential for money in it, they decided to throw formaldehyde in there and see if it would stop the anaphylactic shock because when the body registered a sterilized or live bacterial disease in thein the quantity that's injected, it causes the body to think it's going to die.\n\n So, people die of anaphylactic shock, animals die from vaccines.\n\n They found that if they put in either strychnine or formaldehyde, any other chemical, they would keep the person alive or the animal alive, it didn't go into anaphylactic shock.\n\n\r\nSo, it is all just to sell drugs, and there can never be any evidence that a person would've gotten a disease.\n\n However, we do have the critical evidence that the vaccines cause the very diseases and more diseases.\n\n If you look in appendix D in my book We Want To Live, you'll see that the rate of polio went up to 400 and some percent after forced vaccination, and that's pretty critical, but there are three states that kept record of it in one city in Los Angeles, and they were told to stop keeping record, they were ordered to stop keeping record because they didn't want that information out.\n\n \r\nSo, vaccines are very, very deadly, toxic substances that will give you no benefit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy did they do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMoney?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all it is?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust ask for donations.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\nIt's also a way to annihilate welfare people.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnnihilate means what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnnihilate means kill?\n\n\r\nThey gave it to the world health organization and the country of Britain, United Kingdom and the United States paid for and gave 75 million vaccines of smallpox to Africans.\n\n\r\nGuess what happened to those 75 million people.\n\n 80% of them came down with aids, so it was a way for genocide in Africana?\n\n It's another type of war where they can take the resources of a country and rob them and they don't have to use all those big military things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Cehlation Therapy \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nOkay, let's take for example chelation therapy\n\n People are toting that it's the big great thing.\n\n Now, when I've taken fecal matter and I've tested it, I say, okay, I should see lots of this toxin plus the chemical that they're taking, plus heavy metals in their feces and urine.\n\n  \r\nI found 20%.\n\n You're saying it's going to evacuate.\n\n \r\nIt's not even getting out what they're drinking or they're getting injected into them.\n\n That's not all leaving, and they're making this claim that it is.\n\n They said, \"Oh, pigs did it in, and they got rid of 90 some percent\".\n\n And I said, \"What pigs do you know.\n\n What pigs are you giving chelation therapy to?\n\n Did you get some LA policemen on your diet?\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nSo, that's about it?\n\n If humans are doing it, then they better be checking human feces and human urine and see what's happening.\n\n It doesn't happen, and what I see in iridology is all of those heavy metals leave the soft tissue and go into the bones, connective tissue and lymphatic system, and you see everybody who's had chelation therapy within 7 years after, their skin gets thinner and thinner and thinner because these chemicals are coming and demineralizing their tissue.\n\n  \r\nI remember the first person I watched go through chelation therapy in 1971 through 73.\n\n He did it because he had congestive arteries.\n\n \r\nHis skin thinned out in those three years, it was like just paper thin, and he was dead six months later.\n\n  \r\nYou've got all those chemicals that are constantly leaving the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about they're there to dissolve toxicity, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n They're gonna break down the plaque.\n\n You think they're gonna limit to the arteries.\n\n \r\nIt's gonna dissolve your tissues, your connective tissue and your skin.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Cells Phone Brain Damage \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, they found out last year in the tests that came out from Switzerland that rats that were subjected to 40 minutes of radioactivity from a cell phone a day, shrunk their brains by 30% in one year, 30% in one year\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat cell phone do you have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI use an earbud?\n\n So, when you're on a call, whether you're receiving it or you initiated it is when the radiation is blasting.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cheese Without Butter Dry \n \n \n \n \n### (12) Coconut Cream As Dairy Substitute \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nShe wants me to reiterate the benefits of coconut cream\n\n\r\nYou take the hard mature pulp of the coconut and you juice it, you separate the pulp from the cream.\n\n We're not talking about the coconut milk or the coconut water as it's called, talking about the coconut cream, the white fat and oils that come out of the meat of the coconut.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the oil then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's coconut oil?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that's squeezed out of the same white stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fermented out of the white stuff on centrifugally spun?\n\n\r\nThe coconut cream, see this piece of metal right here, these pieces of metal.\n\n If I put coconut cream on these, within an hour it turns gray?\n\n Starts ripping these metallic substances off of metals, very quickly starts dissolving them.\n\n\r\nSo, it's very good to dissolve a lot of different compounds in the body.\n\n Excellent for detoxification.\n\n\r\nBut coconut cream can substitute for dairy cream and butter, 15 to 20% only, but it is mainly solvent oriented.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Coconut Cream To Clean Body \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, coconut cream, when I'm giving it to somebody as I suggested in my book, it goes before cilantro, something like that\n\n If you want to clean the heavy metals out in the body, let's say a tablespoon before a juice with cilantro in it.\n\n If you want to clean your system out, I'd recommend 2 to 3 to f4 ounces, depending upon your body size and weight in the afternoon with some kind of fruit, just trying to get rid of heavy metals.\n\n\r\nDark berries and coconut cream are very good to help detoxify heavy metals that are in the glandular system, and those that are already  freed, loosed, and traveling in the blood lymphatic system or neurological fluid.\n\n So, it helps the bind with it, dissolve it, neutralize it, but I always suggest that when you're having a large amount of coconut cream like that that you also have at least 3/4 of a tablespoon of butter and about a tablespoon of dairy cream with it.\n\n So, you have some animal fats to make sure you've got enough animal fats, your own fats to bind with any kind of byproduct that would come from the coconut oil dissolving the metal to protect yourself.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, we have 3 - 4 tablespoons.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, 2 -3 ounces, 2 ounces is 4 tablespoons?\n\n So, it's 2 to 4 ounces.\n\n So, you're looking at eight 4 to 8 tablespoons of coconut cream with a fruit.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou never said eight tablespoons to me before.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's because you're not big enough.\n\n It'd be 4 for you.\n\n 4 to 5 max.\n\n \r\nAnd like I said in the book, if you have banana with coconut cream, it helps dissolve hardened tissue, like cirrhosis or sclerotic tissue for Ms or anything like that.\n\n\r\nIf you have any fibroids in your mammary glands or your vaginal area, coconut cream and banana help dissolve that\r\nNot concentrated enough.\n\n The cellulose will not free up enough for it to make a big difference.\n\n It'll work on a minuscule level, but we're too toxic to work on a minuscule level.\n\n Just won't see much progress.\n\n There would be some if you ate it, but it's not gonna be anything like the concentrations of which I'm speaking.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Coconut Oil Detox and Energy and Protect Skin \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow the coconut oil does not\n\n Coconut oil is purely an oil, causes a lot of heat in the body.\n\n You can use it to let's say generate energy, to burn as fuel for energy and for heating the body, and for protecting the skin from the sun, sso you won't burn.\n\n Coconut oil is great for that.\n\n \r\nThe coconut cream is very different.\n\n Coconut cream has a lot of water soluble fats, not just the oil soluble fats that coconut oil has.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Constipation \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDoing a pretty good job now because of all that complex trouble that I had, I had constipation since I was two years old\n\n So, every time I went to the bathroom, which was every 2 to 5days, the first that came out would be the size of my fist, so of course it ripped my rectum.\n\n\r\nSo, I was bleeding every time I had a bowel movement, sometimes at fourth to half a cup of blood every time I had a bowel movement.\n\n So, then I went onto a raw diet, I went almost every day, sometimes several times a day, but that first part out would be huge still.\n\n It would be like granite, just rip me.\n\n So, even on this diet, I would move every day, sometimes several times a day, but always have to always have bloody stools because of the tear.\n\n\r\nOnce I got the tapeworm, disappeared.\n\n So, I was having nice small rounded ones.\n\n Biggest one was probably this big, and it was enjoyable having bowel movements for the first time in my life, so I loved that tapeworm and all of a sudden, I got this craving after about three weeks, I got this craving for an onion and I just sat down ate a half an onion.\n\n\r\nI don't like hot stuff, burns my tongue, and the next morning I shat out that 47 feet of the tapeworm.\n\n I thought, oh no,  my first friend, and I got rid of him, you know.\n\n So, then I saw little pieces of sections that were alive come out over the next few months and I know I kept it?\n\n And then about three months after that period, I had another bowel movement and passed about 45 to 48 feet again, and that was it.\n\n Haven't seen him since, and that was over a year ago, year and a half.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cooked Meat With Vege and Raw Meat With Vege \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFruit and vegetables today and eating that with a balance of meat and I heard you talking a lot about eating raw meat, which sounds fine\n\n I just am more concerned with the ratio, and I'm sure that it's in the book of the vegetables to meat, and I would always think that it would be more fruit and vegetables.\n\n I just wanted a little bit of understanding on that.\n\n\r\nBecause it's in the book, so I'm not gonna go over it here, but if you have a lot of vegetables and I don't suggest that people eat whole vegetables, unless just a little bit of flavoring with some meat, no more than 2 tablespoons in a meal, and that's diced, not full concentrated, it'll over alkanalize the intestines.\n\n\r\nWhen you're eating cooked meat, that's fine.\n\n You want to eat a raw vegetable salad with a cooked meat meat, cause you've got a high acid and it's going to putrify in your system.\n\n It's not going to move it, it stops peristalsis.\n\n There's nothing to cause peristalsis in cooked meat.\n\n\r\nRaw meat there is, there's lots of enzymes and it reacts to the hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, you put an alkaline food in with an acid food, and you're gonna neutralize the acid and alkaline, and you're not gonna digest either.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Cows Milk Better Than Goats \n \n \n \n \n### (18) Dont Detox On Weight Loss \n \n**[2006],[Attendee],[unclear]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWondering, do I leave out the \n oil for fruit and coconut cream if I am on a weight loss\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood question?\n\n When you're on the weight loss, it's to remove the fats that are already chelated with a lot of poisons in your body, it's not to do more detoxification.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're gonna eat foods that cause detoxification, your blood, and your neurological system and your lymph are gonna be too low in fat to protect you from damage.\n\n A lot of those toxins may go right into your cells and damage your RNA and DNA and the cells in general.\n\n So, you do not want to eat detoxifying substances while you're on the weight loss.\n\n \r\nWell in the book, you're eating eggs, meat, and some honey and butter, a little bit of butter, very little bit of butter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Eggs and Milk Chelate With Uric Acid \n \n**[2006],[Jim]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnonymous person who's been trying to get on the diet and trying to get off a medical drug, which is, if it doesn't take it about every three days or something like that, then the whole thing just comes back on in extreme pain and all that\n\n\r\nI finally gave up and I took pill they recommend, and I started pretty  intensively and the swelling went down and I got everything under control, except now I'm on a drug basically, and I've gotta smooth out.\n\n I've gotta get off the drug someday.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, why didn't you call me.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nWell, I had your recommendation, but it, I mean, I was in the kitchen all the time with the pain formulas and soaking in hot water and doing all this stuff?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but maybe I'd come up with something different.\n\n I found out that the calcium and sulfur in eggs and, and milk will chelate with the uric acid that causes gout.\n\n \r\nSome people who eat cooked meat cannot discard the uric acid that accumulates and that causes gout.\n\n So, a good milk diet for about 4 to 6 weeks can get rid of it.\n\n\r\nA heavy egg diet.\n\n Eating an egg every half an hour, eating 2 to 3 quarts of milk a day.\n\n All the foods with high sulfur can help pull out a lot of different chemicals and drugs in the system.\n\n So, you might want to do it diet like that.\n\n \r\nLike for me to get rid of this, I've only been eating meat once a day.\n\n Sometimes up to a pound at a time, but I usually eat two pounds a day, eating a pound twice a day.\n\n But right now I'm just eating one meat meal a day and drinking two quarts of milk with a half a cup of honey in it to detox and get rid of that toxicity.\n\n\r\nAnd I always warm the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you warm it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI put it in a bowl of hot water or take it out in my hot tub?\n\n My hot tub's warm, I'll put it out there.\n\n  and it works a lot better, it helps relax the body.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Eggs Per Day \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\n[This is for a special diet of milk and eggs for gout, and uric acid\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow many eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're doing one every half an hour,  it could be up to 30, 40 a day?\n\n I've had up to 50 a day in my experiments.\n\n**[Attendee #]**\n\r\nFor what conditions.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm just talking about gout, but there's a lot of conditions that can get rid of toxic metals and chemicals in the system and the egg diet and the milk diet will do that?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Elderly Dont Produce Hcl \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAs long as you're not eating cooked foods, there's a lot of people that hit their 80s, octogenarians, that don't produce hydrochloric acid because of their cooked diets\n\n\r\nBut even the Hadza, Maasai and Samburu who lived up to 150 years, they produce hydrochloric acid their entire lives.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Fat Is Good \n \n \n \n \n### (23) Fat People Liver Longer \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThere's a guy at UCLA him, and he's been advocating this for years and they've done experiments with rats and mice, which prove this out\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but the rats of mice are not normal.\n\n They're using chemicals and the animals will react differently than we, and a lot of those, those animals are raised on their natural diet before they are used for laboratory work to raise their resilience.\n\n And then they'll throw 'em off into these experiments and get a whole warped sense of what's going on.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSupposedly, they divided them into two groups, and one group ate whatever they want, and the other group was restricted30% or 40% of their calorie intake.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but do you know what they're feeding those rats in the laboratory.\n\n I know what they're feeding, they're feeding them pellets?\n\n They're feeding them cooked foods.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n So, what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf they lived outdoors, it wouldn't be that way, but living in a cage in a bad environment, it's depressing?\n\n It would make a big difference because you know how how fat people get depressed.\n\n There's a lot of fat people that get depressed because they don't get outside and they don't get in the fresh air?\n\n They don't move around, if they do their whole psyche changes in the way they utilize nutrients.\n\n \r\nSome of your oldest living people are fat people.\n\n  \r\nNo, we're talking about rats.\n\n The rats are fed cooked, processed pellets in the laboratories.\n\n They're not fed their normal diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI know, but supposedly both groups get exactly the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDoesn't make any difference.\n\n The only way you gonna know for sure is to let them overeat their normal diet.\n\n  \r\nWell, it wouldn't even have to be in their natural environment, but that would give a better picture of what happens on the normal diet.\n\n Rats are omnivores, they'll eat almost everything, but they thrive on bugs and insects.\n\n They eat lots of cockroaches, so if they're fed good healthy bugs and creatures and they ate more than another group, it wouldn't be a problem.\n\n  \r\nTake the Fulani for instance, the Fulani tribe lives 90% on dairy.\n\n To become a shaman or the leader of the Fulani tribe you have to be the fattest person.\n\n You have to be the fattest male.\n\n So, these males will eat nothing but gallons and gallons of milk a day, and at the end of that year the fattest one becomes the Chief or the Shaman and they live the longest.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to watch some of these tests.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nMilk makes you fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you're eating two, three gallons a day?\n\n Can you imagine.\n\n You're not allowed to move; you have to sit there in one spot and drink?\n\n Sometimes they'll drink 10 gallons, a day.\n\n It's like the Sumo wrestlers, keep eating and eating, get bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Fat Protection \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis group, they're all hippies, and that's the type that's there, and all of a sudden, about two years ago, a fellow who looked like he came out of a motorcycle gang came in for a private consult\n\n So, it was after the workshop and the next day I see patients the next few days, and he was one of the people who had signed up for a private consult and he was maybe 20 pounds overweight, 23 max.\n\n So, he wasn't skinny, not quite as large as you are, but close.\n\n He had all this thick skin from drug damage and alcohol damage, and I photographed his irises and looked at him, and his glands and his organs were very clean, and he is like 48 - 50 years old, something like that.\n\n And I could see all the drug damage and alcohol damage to his skin, and I said, I know you abused drugs and alcohol for at least 25, 30 years.\n\n He said 30.\n\n And I said, I don't understand it.\n\n I've never seen anybody this clean yet have skin like yours.\n\n You're just not that fat.\n\n He said, three, four months ago, before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds.\n\n So, here he had all this fat, even though it was bad fat, he had enough of it to protect him from all of those years of drug damage, his organs and glands, but not his skin and lymph.\n\n\r\nSo, even the toxic facts is protective.\n\n So, when anybody gets after anybody is fat, I said that person's better off than you skinny.\n\n\r\nPut 'em in their place because they ridicule people who are fat and they're much better off.\n\n You should be fat and happy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Fat With Protein, Fruit With Fat, Detox \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAlways better to have a fat with any kind of fruit, always\n\n Remember fruit, no matter what it is, is going to force detoxification.\n\n The tribes who don't eat cooked food like the Maasai it's illegal to eat fruit because it detoxes.\n\n They don't need detox cause they don't eat anything polluted and it causes the children and the people to get erratic behavior.\n\n\r\nSo, they do not eat fruit, even in its green state.\n\n Other tribes will eat lots of green fruit, and like I say in the book, anytime you eat fruit, you either have a hell of a load of fat in your stomach already, or you eat fat with it and you don't have a hell of a lot of fat on your body.\n\n\r\nSo, you definitely need the fruit with it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Fish Swims Up Penis \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe only one that I saw that was real was the one in South America that if you urinate in the rivers, a small fish will go up inside your penis or your vaginal area, your urethra\n\n If you urinate, it locks itself in.\n\n It's called a Silverfish and it's a parasite and it gets into areas where there's ammonia.\n\n\r\nThe likes the ammonia environment, and it doesn't kill anybody, but it's a very painful one.\n\n It has to be removed with surgery because it locks itself in with all these spines, and it'll go in and let's say it's this small when it goes in, and if you leave it for let's say a month, it can grow this long and that wide instead of just very, very thin.\n\n \r\nSo it'll just keep getting bigger and bigger.\n\n So, your penis may get bigger and bigger, but it's a painful experience.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat country.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSouth America?\n\n Jungles, Amazon.\n\n \r\nI think the one that I actually saw was in Argentina.\n\n\r\nYour orifice has to be open and the urethra is never open, unless you're urinating.\n\n The rectum is never open unless you've gotten in after adding anal sex or you have a bowel movement.\n\n So, that's not really a big problem, but if a female goes in nude and she's open, she's in trouble.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Flash Freezing \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf I flash freeze you, and I thawed you out, would you go work for me\n\n \r\nFlash frozen means it's frozen to the core?\n\n Just means it's done so quickly.\n\n Normally when something freezes slowly, it's like you, you will die slowly.\n\n Chemical changes will occur in your body.\n\n So, if you freeze yourself quickly, you've prevented all of those chemical changes from happening while you're freezing, but when you thaw out, they're going to happen.\n\n \r\nThat's ideal.\n\n Yes, but still, we do the best we can, and it's a lot better than eating poison cooked food.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Float Tanks Bad \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAbsolutely\n\n It does absolutely cause a chelation.\n\n You have to understand the magnetics on your skin is pulling all these minerals out of your blood and lymph and everywhere.\n\n So, it's dehydrating your system.\n\n It's not a good thing.\n\n If you float, don't put all that salt in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you don't float.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPut sea salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA little bit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you don't need much, what I do when I used to use the float tanks, I would put a cup of vinegar in, and a half cup of sun dried sea salt?\n\n\r\nThat was still a lot of brine, but those float tanks, depending upon how long and big they are, they can hold a lot of gallons.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhere can you find those float tanks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I used to do them in Santa Monica?\n\n**[Attendee ]**\n\r\nThey're full of salt, 800 pounds of salt, 11 inches of water, but you float and you feel like you're in the womb.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, what I would do is I would just float enough to where I didn't feel myself touching the bottom very much or barely touching and that's the same sensation.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Freezing and Refridgeration Food, Eggs and Mil \n \n**[2006],[Fred]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIn your second book, you give temperatures, like around 38° or 40°, 45° degrees are about the coldest you ever want to have your food at\n\n I was kind of wondering what happens to food exactly below that temperature.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt starts altering, when it's frozen it alters it critically.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nDid you lose nutrients.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nDoes it become toxic food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUh, well it depends upon your digestion?\n\n Sometimes let's say, if you can't handle those byproducts from the freezing, you will have some problems.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nIt's not anything compared to like heating food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nIt's like a minor thing, so you lose a little bit of nutrients.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, let me put it this way.\n\n When I fed animals the same meat, part of it frozen, part of it cooked, one group frozen, the same meat unfrozen and frozen.\n\n That's all that I gave them.\n\n They didn't get any milk, they didn't get any other dairy, they didn't get any dairy at all and they didn't get any honey and nothing else.\n\n All they got was the frozen meat, the animals who ate it raw, no problems all the way into three months.\n\n  \r\nThe dogs and cats who ate the meat frozen all got skin disease within six weeks.\n\n  \r\nTo experiment that further, I gave them raw butter to help them heal because butter goes to the skin pretty quickly, especially on carnivores.\n\n So, I gave the half of the group that were sick frozen butter, and unfrozen butter.\n\n \r\nThe ones that got the frozen butter took 3 to 5 times longer to heal.\n\n \r\nI stopped feeding them frozen.\n\n I didn't feed them anything else but butter, that's all they got.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nSo, if you kept your fridge, I usually keep mine at 45°, but let's say if it went down to 35°, nothing froze, would a significant amount of nutrients get lost.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n45° is really the low-end point where damage starts happening, but if keep it at 48°, you're likely you make a mistake?\n\n It's only 3°.\n\n \r\nEggs and milk are damaged as soon as they go below 70°.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Fruit Damages Too Much \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nInstinctive diet, you only eat what smells good to you\n\n How often does raw meat smell good.\n\n It doesn't, so these people eat 60 %to 80% fruits, and they just start wiping the fat out of their body and demineralizing?\n\n She died six months after starting that diet died, she lost all this weight.\n\n \r\nElnora Van winkel.\n\n She was the one that wrote The Biology of Emotions.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI saw Daniel and he looked really thin and dry skin.\n\n I couldn't recognize him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDaniel went another way, but you get to see.\n\n It's good because you get to see what it does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy didn't Kimberly recover.\n\n She was 100% raw?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe never could gain enough weight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nPretty good.\n\n Pretty chunky.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe needed more weight.\n\n She had thallium all in her body.\n\n \r\nWe're talking about a woman who was pretty skinny when she went on the diet, pretty sick, and she got breast cancer.\n\n She went on the diet very strictly, gained about 27 pounds, when you're that skinny 27 pounds is okay.\n\n  \r\nShe didn't gain that much fat.\n\n I wish she had, probably about 7 or 8 pounds less than you are, but she put it on compared to what she was.\n\n She was stocky, she carried it thickly all over, and then when she started dissolving the tumors in her body, she started doing like all people who have cancer when it starts dissolving the dead cells in the body, the chemicals that are in those dead cells that have killed those cells that have caused the accumulation of the dead cells that is tumor and cancer, they dissolve with it.\n\n \r\nAnd you better have a lot of nutrients to handle that cause you vomit and you vomit and you have diarrhea, and if you don't have enough fat on you, you will not catch up.\n\n You'll get behind, and it was just to the point where the breast cancer was going away.\n\n Two weeks before she died, all the breast cancer had resolved, but it had gone to the liver.\n\n \r\nSo, the liver was highly contaminated.\n\n So, I took one of her vomits and had it analyzed for $2,200 for one vomit, per vomit, and I had several of them analyzed.\n\n The head of the lab called me and said, \"Somebody's poisoning your patient\".\n\n And I said, \"What are you talking about\".\n\n He said, \"She has 3000 times the lethal dose of thallium in her vomit\"?\n\n \r\nAnd I said she was a jewelry maker.\n\n She never used a mask and she never wore gloves.\n\n Seven years of inhaling burned thallium and all the other heavy metals and getting it into her skin never using gloves.\n\n It absorbed into her liver and into her breast on the right side.\n\n  \r\nIt's too poisonous, she didn't have enough fat.\n\n If she had had, let's say another 10 pounds, she probably could have made it through the liver detoxification like she did the breast detoxification, but it's too late for her.\n\n She just didn't gain enough weight.\n\n She couldn't eat, when you were vomiting like that you can't eat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Gallbladder and Breaking Up Stones, Vege Oils R Rocks \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWe have a gallbladder only when we were primitive\n\n When we'd slaughter an animal, we'd eat sometimes 50 pounds in two days of meat with lots of fat and eat all the fat first.\n\n Your liver cannot produce enough bile to digest that much fat in a 48-to-72-hour period.\n\n So, the gallbladder for when we were primitive and add, eat a tremendous amount of fat and meat at one time.\n\n \r\nIf you ate two pounds of meat with about probably a half a cup of butter a day with probably two dozen eggs, your liver, even if it has a stone in it, can produce enough bile to handle that much food.\n\n Your liver produces enough, doesn't have to store it in the gallbladder.\n\n \r\nThat's just a reserve.\n\n That's why people can have their gallbladders removed and there's no problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCan you break them down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf they're made from soy chips and soy foods, no?\n\n They turn as hard as stone and there's nothing I can do to dissolve it.\n\n Normally you could take some sparkling water, some lemons, some vinegar, and some clay and mix that together, and with some kind of coconut cream or olive oil and it'll break up stones.\n\n \r\nBut when they're made from soy products, they're as hard as rock.\n\n Can't break them up.\n\n That's why James had to have the bladder surgery cause his stones, they had to blast his stones with more force than that surgeon had blasted anybody's before in his life.\n\n And this surgeon's not a young man and they had to blast with a laser.\n\n  \r\nHis stones took 50 times more blast than they've ever had to utilize, and James was a vegetarian for 30 years.\n\n He lived on soy chips.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat are soy chips.\n\n Are they potato chips?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPotato chips are made from soy and boiled in soy oil, it's like rock big?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThey're pushing them.\n\n Even at Whole Foods, a lot of soy products.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely, big money.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Gorillas Eat Meat, Fruitarians \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThey're theorizing from no experience\n\n Your gorillas, every 28 days they eat 14 pounds in a 24-hour period of meat.\n\n So, these people didn't observe them very well.\n\n Most of your monkeys all eat meat, even the chimpanzee.\n\n  \r\nThe only monkeys that don't eat much meat are the killer monkeys.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nThey go on a fruit binge.\n\n They'll eat all these fermented guavas or figs or overripe bananas, and they'll just binge for 24 hours, and then they'll go on a killing spree for 24 hours.\n\n  \r\nHitler was a vegetarian, a diehard vegetarian.\n\n You saw what happened to his mind.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Grapefruit For Itchy Skin \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPut a cream on the itching\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it would smother it and I didn't want to smother and lock those chemicals in my body?\n\n So, what I did was I coated myself with urine and that stopped the itching, it stung.\n\n And if it started itching so badly, like when I used to have eczema and all kinds of problems when I was a kid taking a lot of medication, especially insulin.\n\n \r\nInsulin caused a lot of things like this.\n\n I would take a Listerine and put it on my body, it would sting and burn so badly, at least it was better than itching to death, you know.\n\n  \r\nWell, I found that if you take white grapefruit and you rub that on, it'll do the same thing?\n\n It'll sting and stop the itching without preventing the chemicals from coming through the skin without smothering the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about lemons.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLemons too abrasive?\n\n You know how it marinates chicken and fish.\n\n You damage your skin pretty badly if you do that, I burned a hole in myself when I was experimenting with it, actually burned a hole right my flesh when I woke up the next day?\n\n  \r\nI used lemon on one spot to break it down for two days in a row, and I wake up one morning, I had a hole in my body and that was very painful.\n\n So, lemon's not the thing to use, nor is lime.\n\n I was saving experience with the year.\n\n Oh, I did.\n\n I've been at home.\n\n been at home.\n\n \r\nThe grapefruit doesn't for some reason.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about pineapple.\n\n \r\nAajonus] \r\nPineapple will burn a hole right in your skin?\n\n I've tried everything, and grapefruit is the only thing I found it worked in a condition like that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Honey and Eggs Together \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wasn't able to eat milk, eggs, and honey together for many, many years, I got stomach cramps\n\n \r\nI could eat eggs and milk together, or I could eat honey and milk together, but never honey and eggs.\n\n Probably because of the surgery that I had had.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) How Long Weight Loss \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow long should I do the weight loss this time around, what's your estimate\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUh, let me punch in the stomach and see *laughs* \r\nIt all depends?\n\n Usually, you go on the weight loss when you go a week with only losing a pound, and your body doesn't wanna lose anymore, and that's usually where you should stop.\n\n  \r\nWhen you go a week and only lose a pound, then stop it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOn the weight loss you're eating only eggs, meat and honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're having very little honey and very little fat, but in The Recipe Book, I have the weight loss program and, and it's mainly eggs and meat, basically just about it?\n\n And some juice and some people because you are eating very small amounts of meat during the day, like 1 to 2 to 3 golf ball sizes of meat, 3 or 4 times a day along with a little bit of butter or no butter, and then you're having some vegetable juice and you're eating raw eggs, it doesn't work for some people.\n\n \r\nIt works for about 80% to 85% of the people.\n\n The people it doesn't work for need to eat about an egg every hour.\n\n Followed by a quarter of a teaspoon of honey butter mixture, equal portions of honey, butter.\n\n So, every hour and I guarantee you everybody loses weight with that one and have one meat meal a day, maybe a half a cup a day in the evening and a cup of milk before you go to sleep and a cup of milk at night, so you're relax and feel good.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) How Muchmercury I Nvaccine \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have mass poisoning, an injection of vaccine, like I said is 76,000 trillion molecules of mercury\n\n How many injections have you gotten in your life.\n\n How many molecules of mercury are in your system?\n\n Some people are never gonna get all the mercury out of their bodies?\n\n Kids are getting 128 shots by the time they're 16 years old in some states, mandatory.\n\n\r\nIt's a crime.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) How Often Lube Formula \n \n \n \n \n### (38) Milk Above 70 Replicate Cells \n \n**[2006],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBelow 70°\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right?\n\n If I get milk straight from the cow and never chill it, I can use it like meat.\n\n It will help regenerate cells.\n\n Anytime that milk is chilled below 70°, it loses its ability to help you regenerate cells.\n\n So we need to eat a lot more meat.\n\n\r\nIt won't help you divide cells, but it will help you rebuild cells that are already alive.\n\n So, meat is the only thing that you can get it down to 45°, 40°, and it will still help you regenerate, but once it goes under about 36° for meat it's affected that way too.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Milk and Honey Routine \n \n**[2006],[Jim]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, if I'm gonna do this, how do you keep the honey from just being just solid honey at the bottom of the milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI take an eight-ounce jelly jar?\n\n I fill it halfway with milk, warm milk halfway with the honey.\n\n I blend it and then pour it into the two quarts.\n\n \r\nI get these half gallon glass jars.\n\n That's how I get my milk.\n\n Most people get the plastic, it's good idea to remove it from the plastic and put it in the glass when you get it home, if you're going to do that.\n\n But I got these half pound glass jars, my milk's in there.\n\n So, I take some out, I'll drink a half a cup and then a half cup of honey with 1/2 cup of milk and then pour it into the half gallon jar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, one question about that is, so if he's doing all of this, is he still eating meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nJust one time?\n\n \r\nOne meat meal a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nA 12-ounce meat meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, it depends?\n\n Um, I was eating two cups at a time, some people can just get by with one cup.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWhen we talked about this before, you said, anytime I eat meat I have to have an equal portion of fish.\n\n So, I've been doing that in that stage.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat's fine.\n\n That's your system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWith butter, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDon't need butter with that?\n\n  \r\nOh, and I also 2 to 3 ounces of cream of extra cream to the 2 quarts of milk.\n\n Make it a little richer.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Pesticides \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, this is the worst country for the most adulterated foods\n\n Even England won't allow the pesticides at the rate that we do.\n\n However, our government has overthrown the Chilean government and some other, the Central American governments, and there shipping all of the chemicals, pesticides that are bad here, selling them to them and using them on them and their agriculture.\n\n\r\nAnd then those foods are coming back into the states.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Picked Up A Parasite \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou picked up a parasite where\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIn Nepal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo you like him.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot at all here?\n\n I was very lucky to have it, but I didn't feel I needed it.\n\n\r\nI ended up taking antibiotics.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLots of lime and lemon juice together, equal parts of lime to honey lime.\n\n And that will pretty much destroy.\n\n Did you had a tapeworm or an intestinal fluke, which kind of did you have.\n\n\r\nThat's an internal fluke, that isn't a fluke that runs around in Nepal water, although it does, it runs around water everywhere, all over the world?\n\n So, it's doubtful you got it from there.\n\n It's probably just time for you to detox cause you were in a humid climate \r\nHumidity causes lots of bacteria and parasites to come active in the body.\n\n That's why tropical areas have more parasites and more insects because it breeds them.\n\n It's good weather for them, but that doesn't mean they're bad.\n\n You know.\n\n \r\nI got my first parasite almost two years ago and it was while I was in the jungles in Vietnam, and you don't get tape worms from the jungles, this is an internal thing?\n\n So, I was delighted because that's my first worm.\n\n I've been trying to get parasites.\n\n I've eaten so many different kinds of parasites and parasite invested meats to get the tapeworms and to get parasites, but was never able to take hold because I had had so much chemotherapy and radiation in my body and other heavy metals from all the injections and medications that not much bacteria, and no parasite could ever feed on my body because if it ate a cell it would die, it was so poisonous.\n\n \r\nSo, I got my first one about two years ago and I was on the toilet constantly and I thought, oh my gosh, I get to really detoxify quickly.\n\n\r\nMaybe it'll help you that surgery that I had a little compound in there.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Remove Teeth Fillings, Teeth Regeneration \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, about six years ago, I got fillings\n\n Not the non-mercury fillings, but like the white veneer, like healthy ones.\n\n I called them and asked them what substance was in it and is called Herculite.\n\n Sounds great, doesn't it.\n\n I really wanna like go to the dentist and get it taken outta my body because I think it'd best to get it out?\n\n This one here, your opinion would it be best to get it out.\n\n Could you talk a little bit about that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe only people that I've ever seen regenerate dentine and tissue when their teeth didn't rot were under 22 years old and they ate a tremendous amount of raw milk?\n\n \r\nLike three quarts a day.\n\n So, it took them three years to repair one cavity in both of those people.\n\n How many are you gonna have taken out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI think like two?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're asking for trouble.\n\n Everybody else that I've seen has done that and let the tooth exposed ended up with decaying, rotting, teeth, it oxidizes.\n\n \r\nWhat I do is I keep having fillings and they'll pop out after a year or two and they grow out, the filling will actually grow out because my tooth is filling in on the inside.\n\n  \r\nAnd the dentist is amazed because when he goes in to put the new one in, it's a smaller area and he doesn't have to do any drilling anymore.\n\n \r\nBut when I tested and left the filling out completely, the tooth oxidized and rotted and fell outta my mouth.\n\n This is the last one I tested and it is doing the same thing.\n\n It's rotting.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat are you getting your teeth filled with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nComposite?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nA particular composite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOne that I'm biologically not allergic to?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYou can get yourself tested.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDoesn't it still have mercury and bad stuff in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's so little in that, and when you got an enamel, unless you've got rust in your mouth, it's not going to break down?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, if I just eat good enough of a diet, maybe a bunch of milk like you said, then I can count on my tooth maybe just pop it out and then I don't have to worry about it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf your body is re-growing and re-healing, it'll pop out on its own and then consider leaving it exposed?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Replacing Cells and Blood \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWe regenerate all these cells within so many days and we're brand new every seven years\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's all in his imagination?\n\n It has nothing to do with chemistry.\n\n You have to understand, he's an MD.\n\n He was only taught disease and chemicals and not healthy chemicals, drugs.\n\n He was not taught chemistry, o he knows nothing about chemistry.\n\n  \r\nIf you look at the blood, it takes 45 days to replace every cell in the blood.\n\n A lot of people think it takes 10 days.\n\n That's if your body is taking the spleen and using the blood out of the spleen, which is already built up, but if your body doesn't have the spleen, if the spleen's cut off, cut out, it takes 45 days to regenerate every cell in the blood.\n\n \r\nAnd it does it in the bone marrow, the bone marrow is a breeding ground for red and white blood cells.\n\n They divide their and become their own cells, grow up, and go into the blood.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, if you're 20.\n\n So, you've been 20 years of eating the American diet, so even 40 years to get it out if you're only 20.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat's right?\n\n \r\nShe'd be 60 years old if you do it 100%, but still, you have to look at it this way.\n\n You're getting better every day that you do it because you're not adding toxins to your system.\n\n If you're adding toxins to your system, you're going to get worse.\n\n If you're adding good nutrients to your body every day, you keep adding to your health.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to look at it like that, you can't look at the end of the tunnel.\n\n You're not there.\n\n It's so far away.\n\n You're gonna think I'll never make it to the tunnel.\n\n You just have to be happy with your progress every day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Scientologists Detox \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nIn the late 70s, I was working with a lot of Scientologists and they had a detox program for radiation\n\n They take a lot of niacin and B vitamins and a lot of other supplements and they get them to sweat.\n\n Well, back in those days, they weren't using any fat, and I would see all these Scientologists and these are great people.\n\n\r\nI loved every one of 'em that I ever met.\n\n The most rational group of people that I've ever.\n\n I mean more rational than anybody I've ever met as a group and it's something about their clearing and how they adjust their psychology to narrow behavior.\n\n It'd be nice if we just do it physiologically with diet and we could do that, and that does help, but they've got trainings to help do that.\n\n\r\nBut when they would get off of these detox programs, they'd be all flushed for a few weeks.\n\n Within three to six months, they were going into chronic fatigue, and I watched this year after year.\n\n So, I got together with a lot of scientologists and talked them into putting the fat.\n\n, and now they're using olive oil.\n\n That wasn't my choice.\n\n\r\nMy choice was to use raw butter and raw dairy cream, but we were having a lot of trouble with the milk commissioners at that time, so they settled for the olive oil.\n\n It works, but they're not using the kind of chemistry that they're using for chelation therapy, but I still see detriment physiologically from doing it.\n\n\r\nIt helps, but like I say, anytime you're using vitamin, niacin, it is a chemical, you're going to have imbalances and you're going to have damage.\n\n\r\nWho's the most famous scientist and teacher of life of life extension.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, and what's the other fellow.\n\n You look at them, they're all dried up and skinny.\n\n They're not happy people and they're hyperactive and they can't sit still.\n\n Terrible, terrible system.\n\n\r\nThey think that they can live on chemicals instead of food, and it's not healthy.\n\n Pardon.\n\n Jerry Nolan?\n\n There's another one.\n\n He's wife couple.\n\n Yeah.\n\n And\r\nThey look like dried up leather and Zuni dolls.\n\n\r\nWorst looking people I've ever seen.\n\n Oh, in person, those pictures are touched up.\n\n If you see them in person, they look like Zuni dolls that have been dried up in the desert for 40 years.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Soaps Were Made From Coconut & Lye \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\n60 years ago, even 50 years ago, about 90% of all soaps were made from coconut\n\n They had a coconut base to them because they were great for cleansing: shampoos, body soaps, everything had coconut in it, laundry soaps, kitchen aids.\n\n They all had coconut in them.\n\n  \r\nBut you have to grow coconuts.\n\n You have to have people to cut them down because you can't have machines do it.\n\n So, it's a people-oriented industry.\n\n It's a lot of work.\n\n So, companies decided, \"Oh we can make chemicals to do this.\n\n Not caring about what it does to your body and your skin.\n\n We can make these cleansers, these solvents from unnatural substances that are poisoned and we can make a lot more money.\n\n And that's why they shipped it away from coconut.\n\n \r\nThere are still countries that use coconut, but they're not ours and they're not Britain, unless they're specialty health food, or health minded stores or companies that will make coconut soaps available for you.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nSo, you're saying coconut itself are healthier to use if you can get them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you can get them naturally made?\n\n It's coconut cream, not coconut oil, coconut cream mixed with lye.\n\n That's how they used to make soap.\n\n Put lye in like you do with the cement, that hardens the fat, dries it out.\n\n Then when it gets wet, it acts as a soap and the lie will even help do that, but you just have to know to keep the lye down at a very minimal level, just enough to dry the coconut cream, so it will harden.\n\n \r\nIf it gets wet, it lathers nicely.\n\n It cleans nicely.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nSo, the lye's not toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe lye is toxic, except when it's bound with the fat, the oils.\n\n \r\nNow, they used to do it with take pig lard They used to make soaps out of any kind of fat, they would render it.\n\n Wood ash was another way that they did it.\n\n They would use the light woods, burn it so the ash would be light, and then they mix it with some kind of fat to make soaps.\n\n \r\nBut lye was the chemical way to do it.\n\n The industrial way, put lye with it instead of Ash.\n\n But an Ash of course would be probably a little bit healthier, but in my lab, experiments with lye in oils, the lie doesn't get free.\n\n Once it's bound in the fat, it's locked in.\n\n \r\nI've never seen it show evidence of absorption into the body.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Stainless Steel Fine, Radioactives Battery Bad \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA lot of watches have stainless steel bands\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nStainless steel is fine.\n\n It's the radioactive battery that propels it.\n\n So, if you've got one that winds, the old style type, you wind it with the shaking of it, that's a good one.\n\n You've got a radioactive battery in batteries.\n\n  \r\nYou know how much radiation that puts into your body.\n\n Tremendous amount?\n\n It's like wearing a low dose cell phone on your wrist.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Supplements Cause Damage \n \n**[2006],[Aajouns]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVery toxic, they're chemicals\n\n They're just gonna create more imbalances in the body.\n\n When the body puts a nutrient combination together, it's not just vitamin C or it's not just  vitamin B6 six, it's a whole conglomerate.\n\n You've got a whole array of b vitamins that always work together.\n\n You've got a whole conglomerate of bioflavonoids with the C, with fat, with vitamin a, with vitamin D.\n\n There's always that coupling of so many nutrients, and if you broke them down, you'd have at least 30 identifiable nutrients in each combination, and when you're taking a supplement, it is a die hard in the wool concentrated substance.\n\n It's a chemical, it is not a balanced food substance.\n\n\r\nSo, your body's gonna have to re-counterbalance itself, and it's gonna do damage.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Tapeworms Live On Sugar \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe trichinosis, the whipworm that all humans used to have up to about 10,000 years ago, and many still had, the Africans still had them produces three enzymes, which prevent pancreatic cancer and one that prevents brain tumor\n\n  \r\nSo, we're finding out all these parasites are good for us, not bad for us, and we'd be a lot healthier and all the animals in humans who have them are healthier in digestibility and digestion, everything.\n\n They do a lot better.\n\n  \r\nSo, parasites are your friend, if though you were so toxic with decaying tissue from pesticides and all of that will kill so many of them, you will be fed on by a lot of parasites.\n\n \r\nIt's like third world children.\n\n The World Health Organization says, \"Oh, we're gonna help these poor starving children in Ethiopia and everywhere\".\n\n You know what they give them.\n\n They pay the cereal industry billions of dollars to get them shipped garbage and denatured food?\n\n So, these children eat these cereals, which are highly toxic, and most of them are fried.\n\n \r\nSo, what happens is you have all these acrylamides that build up, with all these acrylamides it poisons the children.\n\n So, they get these tapeworms that try to reduce the sugar in the body, in the intestines, and that's what the tapeworms are eating.\n\n They're eating sugar damaged cells and excess carbohydrate byproducts.\n\n \r\nSo, they're necessary.\n\n They're not causing the starvation of these children.\n\n They're putting little smoke streams up and and saying that's what's causing it, the tapeworm.\n\n No, it's the toxic food, non-food that they're being fed.\n\n You're causing them to disintegrate, the human body needs meat, milk, some kind of animal protein to sustain itself, especially tribes in Africa who were that's what they've lived on for ages.\n\n \r\nThey are not cereal oriented individuals.\n\n \r\nKellogg's is one of the biggest, and Purina.\n\n Their whole bodies are decaying because of this food substance that they're getting.\n\n Then of course, you can have parasite to eat up your body.\n\n  \r\nLet's say your liver's completely damaged, and the parasite goes in to help you clean it.\n\n Well, if the whole liver is bad, then the whole liver's going to be eaten.\n\n Could.\n\n That's not a normal scenario, but it's a possibility.\n\n So, you may have 20 people out of 100 people die from it.\n\n That's not a lot of people.\n\n Um if you're looking at average, but it's still, that's a big chance of dying.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Tired On Detox, Sleep Good, More Meat \n \n \n \n \n### (50) Tomatoes and Peppers Are Fruits \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you call tomatoes and bell peppers fruits or vegetables\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFruits?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Too Thin Causes Sickness \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, it depends\n\n You're very thin, so what happens when you have a toxin that gets freed and loosed from the system: mercury, lead, thallium, cadmium, no matter what it might be, if you don't have the fat to arrest it, it can damage cells in your body and they will die.\n\n  \r\nThat's why I like people to be fat.\n\n I like people to be at least 20% body.\n\n I like sick people to be 30% body fat.\n\n \r\nThat's a difficult one.\n\n You know, it just depends.\n\n People can screw around and screw around and screw around, until it's too late.\n\n They say well, I'll do it when I can do it, and you've done that for years for, I known you for what, six years, eight years.\n\n Eight years now?\n\n And many times have you said, \" I can't do it right now\".\n\n \r\nI just can't do it right now.\n\n And I said, I kept telling you Burt, there's gonna be a time when it's too late, and I don't know what that's going to be.\n\n But I've seen some people just it's too late, especially if they're skinny, if they're fat, I'll never say it's too late.\n\n If they're skinny, I've seen it too late.\n\n I've seen people drop off and die.\n\n  \r\nTake for example, Elnora Van Winkel.\n\n That neuroscientist who spent her whole life for like almost 50 years cataloging all of the compounds, the chemicals that were in the brain and nervous system.\n\n She discovered this diet; she went on it.\n\n She did research with it, backed up a lot of my findings, and she went on the internet and sent a letter to the New York times about my work and diet and how she was able to prove it chemically.\n\n And she did very well, when she started, she was skinny as a beam ball, skinny as when Twiggy was 20 years old.\n\n And she went on the diet, started gaining all this weight and then somebody told her about instincto diet.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Vaccines Required For Going In Jungle \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFunding from Britain and the United States went in and said, \"Oh, we'll give you all this money and support, but we need this as collateral\", their natural resources\n\n\r\nThey gave them money to treat the aids with Western medicine.\n\n That's what gave it to them in the first place.\n\n So, here these African countries, not knowing any better.\n\n Not having the science that we do said, \"Oh, we accept your help\".\n\n\r\nBut when they accepted the help, the collateral was the resources, and their government.\n\n So, now the world health organization is set up puppet governments through the US and in the United Kingdom and were running those countries and all the resources.\n\n \r\nJust two years ago there was South American country where they did that and they got the water resources.\n\n So, nobody was allowed to even collect rain water because this company that funded the country owned all the water rights.\n\n You could not even collect rain water.\n\n So the people rebelled, they started killing the government and within six months they completely wiped out that company.\n\n The company was out of the country.\n\n \r\nYou see what big business is doing.\n\n People are greedy and they're going to use whatever tactics and you're just like an ant to them.\n\n You're very expendable, they have no remorse about stepping on you.\n\n\r\nI think Oliver stone is doing a film about that right now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDon't you get vaccinated when you go to Thailand and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe only time you have to get a vaccine is if you go into a jungle?\n\n\r\nSo, let's say you fly down to Peru or some other jungle where they say you have to take a yellow fever for the mosquito bite.\n\n All you have to do is don't tell 'em you went, show no records of going into the jungle.\n\n You fly down to the Chito or some big city in South America, and then you take the bus or private excursion.\n\n\r\nSo, your name doesn't show up as going into the jungle, then when you come back, You're not required to do it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Vegetable Juic With Eggs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA vegetable juice about once every three days if you're doing the eggs\n\n Don't necessarily need it with the milk, but you will need it.\n\n If you're eating a lot of eggs about 8 to 16 ounces once every three days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSounds like a weight loss.\n\n \r\nAajonus]\r\nNo.\n\n Well, if you're eating an egg every hour that'll cause weight loss, but one every half an hour won't cause weight loss.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt will cause weight gain.\n\n\r\nAajonus]\r\nNo, it'll just stabilize it?\n\n It's very difficult to gain weight on eggs.\n\n Cooked eggs you can gain weight quickly.\n\n\r\nWhen the mercury was coming out in huge spots, I had one come out this morning.\n\n I just felt it getting a little sensitive last night, and I've had many injections here, penicillin.\n\n And all of a sudden it felt like I had just gotten an injection, and the next morning I woke up and there was a huge head on it with a black center.\n\n\r\nAll these white cells around it, black center and it smelled just like the mercury and under a microscope, and that's what it was, it was mercury.\n\n You can see it.\n\n It's a little hard to see when something is crystallized, but I caught this in mine.\n\n \r\nNow they turn so quickly I don't even get to see them as far as when they're in the postulation stage.\n\n This one because it hurts so badly before it came through the skin and burned my skin, I was able to arrest it before it got to the crystal state.\n\n But most of 'em come out as crystals like you saw this one here, it just flaked off in all these crystals, black and dark brown crystals.\n\n\r\nThen I had crushed them and mixed 'em with distilled water before I can tell what they are.\n\n And still because they're so conglomerated with all these other minerals and, and substances, it's difficult to distinguish what all compounds are in it, but this one was very easy to tell.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Vegetarians Are Sick \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVegetarians\n\n Some of were 70 years old, old hippies from the 60s, and that's almost about 60% to 70% of this community is old time hippies that have been vegetarians long term.\n\n We're talking 25, 35 years as vegetarians, sickest group of people I've seen, and another side to that is 50% of my cancer patients were long term vegetarian.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Virus Dont Come From Mosquitos \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe whole idea that that infection comes from mosquitoes is pretty bizarre in the first place\n\n Mosquito, which is a female, and the female is about like 10 to 15 times larger than the male.\n\n The male eats bee pollen and so does the female.\n\n Just like bees, they live like bees only they don't store the honey, the nectar or the bee pollen, that's what they eat.\n\n And they feed on the very, very tiny little flowers that the bees can't feed on cause the bees can't suspend themselves in those tiny little flowers.\n\n Really tiny little flowers, so that's what mosquitoes pollinate and eat.\n\n  \r\nThe female collects blood, not for herself, but for her offspring, the larva.\n\n So, what she will do is collect the blood.\n\n She sticks her proboscis deep into the skin and bites every cell in the area makes a pool of blood and then she'll suck it up.\n\n So, she could destroy somewhere like 50 cells just by biting them.\n\n  \r\nAnd you saw The Alien where that thing comes out, it's got all those teeth in it.\n\n Well, at the end of the mosquito's proboscis, that's what it looks like.\n\n And it just starts chewing all the surrounding cells so the blood pools.\n\n They suck it up, they take it back to the creek or the water pond or even if it's a little water that's caught in a leaf on the ground and that's where she's laid her offspring, the larva, then she will just have a little bubble and put it in the bubble and they swim up, and they just keep feeding out of that blood bubble in the water, and that's how the larva eat.\n\n When she does it, she doesn't contaminate that blood, the bloods to feed her offspring.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you think that there's some kind of malaria, it isn't.\n\n That's how they get you afraid, so that you can imagine an enemy and that enemy is the mosquito, but there's no evidence that you can get any kind of disease from mosquitoes.\n\n It is the diet, no matter what it is.\n\n And if you go down and they tell you to cook everything, when you go down there, they'll tell you to boil water, steam, or cook all of your vegetables.\n\n \r\nAnd it is a ludicrous process because you're more likely to get a disease, a detoxification.\n\n Example in point was in the mid 80s, they made a movie called Latino.\n\n It's about our involvement in Nicaragua in the 80s, and there were two soldier leads and one of 'em was on my diet.\n\n And he brought this long list to me, it was about a legal-size paper.\n\n It was everything that he was not supposed to do.\n\n If you're gonna take showers, use lots of soap.\n\n \r\nDry yourself very well.\n\n Use distilled water for your shower even better.\n\n Boil your water If you're not gonna distilled, distilled is best.\n\n cook everything.\n\n If you're in the swamps, do not touch your face before you wash your hands, take all of your clothes off and have them bleached and and heavily laundered before you wear them again.\n\n  \r\nThis whole list.\n\n I said, Tony, you do everything just the opposite it says, and you'll be fine.\n\n Drink the swamp water because Nicaragua is one of the great lakes of the central American countries.\n\n It has more water per space areas, so there's lots of swamp, as well as the lakes there.\n\n \r\nSo, of course, during the shooting they had to go through the swamps.\n\n So, he was drinking the water, he was eating the raw meat in the restaurants.\n\n Out of all the 43 to 46 people who were in the set, on the in the crew.\n\n He was the only one who didn't get sick.\n\n Robert Beltran who's the star got so sick he lost 50 pounds and they had to shut down the film for five weeks.\n\n Tony did not get sick.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Weight Loss Is For Losers \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why I say the weight loss in the book is just for women and men who are paranoid they're not gonna lose the fat\n\n So, I tell them every six months to do the weight and gain loss, then after they do it for a year and a half or so, then they don't worry about not losing it cause they see that they can lose it.\n\n\r\nI'd like people to keep the fat on for 2.\n\n5 years before they lose it.\n\n That way, if you go into a pneumonia or a meningitis, whether it's spinal or cerebral, you'll get through it easily of you have enough fat.\n\n \r\nBurt, you just put it off all these years, you just kept telling me, you know, I can't do it right\r\nNo, you said I can't do that.\n\n I'm traveling.\n\n I can't do that.\n\n I can't eat that way.\n\n I'm in rehearsals.\n\n You've said that to me many times.\n\n\r\nAnd you also times you couldn't afford it.\n\n I've heard that a lot from you over the years, but that doesn't mean you can't do it.\n\n You just have to force yourself.\n\n You have to deal with nausea.\n\n You have to deal with that.\n\n You have to force it down, just like I did after the poison mushroom.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

drinking\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThis is a mixture of hard green pineapple, cucumber, honey, lemon juice, coconut cream, coconut oil, eggs, and honey?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYou drink that every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n Once in a while.\n\n So, what do it for is just to help dissolve dead cells, and also, I'll get relieved.\n\n Let's say I'm detoxing heavily, and I feel sore and bruised all over that's because I don't have enough vitamin C and the other citric acids to help break down that toxicity and relieve it from the body.\n\n So, if I eat that my soreness and stiffness will go away after the detox.\n\n  \r\nYou know, like you have a cold or flu when it's over, you're saying, oh my God, I feel stiff.\n\n That's because you're low in citric acid and other nutrients that can help dissolve neutralize the uric acid.\n\n \r\nWhen you're exercising the same thing, you're not used to exercising and then you get stiff, it's because of uric acid and other byproducts of burning fuel, utilizing fuel and energy stores in the body and causes a buildup that causes the soreness.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow much do you use.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI use?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n1 cup of pineapple  \r\n\r\n2 cups of cucumber  \r\n\r\n1 tablespoon of coconut oil (fermented coconut oil), \r\n\r\n2.\n\n5 - 3 ounces of coconut cream \r\n\r\n2 ounces of honey \r\n\r\n3 tablespoons of lemon juice.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow do you ferment the coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's the way it comes?\n\n The one you buy from James, it's fermented coconut oil.\n\n The only thing he has is coconut oil that's fermented.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs that the coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, coconut oil isn't refrigerated?\n\n It looks like Crisco oil, unless it's warm like today, then It'll be liquid.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nEssentially, do you need all that.\n\n Let's say, you're exercising, you got aches?\n\n Is it just the vitamin C you need.\n\n So, if you had like an orange and some cream?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou don't have the fats, and the reason I use the cucumber is because it's got a lot of silica in it, which helps the skin and tissues relax and cool?\n\n \r\nSo, if you've got the acids in there, the vitamin C, not just the vitamin C, the other acid here involved in citrus, if you want to break down the substances, you need minerals to help bind with those toxins.\n\n Plus you need the fats to arrest those poisons, so they don't get reabsorbed.\n\n So that's why the whole formula all together.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, every time you go exercising.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that's if you start getting sore, that means you're getting depleted in certain nutrients that this could provide?\n\n \r\nI went through a massive brain detox for the past three years, and it got to the point where my neck was getting so stiff and sore and it wasn't reacting, and I started getting sore on the right side.\n\n So, then I started drinking that and within a day it was relieving incrementally, but I only eat that maybe when I'm going through a time of stiffness and soreness.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDo you put the whole cucumber.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf it's organic I put the whole cucumber, the peel and all?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Tapeworm \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo it's a delicate

can see it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh yeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat does it look like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt was a tapeworm?\n\n I passed 25 feet of it one day and 30 feet of it another day, but I saw parts of it passing for about four months, and then all of a sudden it finished its work, and within two weeks I had dumped the whole thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDid you catch it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh yeah, I caught it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWas it still alive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, no?\n\n Once it's out of the body, it doesn't survive.\n\n You get these little links, like some kind of pasta.\n\n It looked like pasta, you let them sit and dry up.\n\n They just disappear.\n\n They just completely disappear, and there's this very teeny, little thing, you know, they could get in the dirt anywhere.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Abortion, Oil In Vagina \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat's a safer alternative for abortion\n\n  \r\nDon't worry mom, it's not?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour son's pregnant! *Laughs* \r\nWhen you're on this diet, abortion is difficult because the body is so healthy.\n\n The only way that I've suggested, and that's worked with people who've been on the diet awhile is putting pennyroyal oil, but you have to take a scientific tube that allows just just a very fine passage in there, and you have to insert that through the cervix where the oil and you have to blow it inside of you.\n\n You have to scratch.\n\n It's not a sharp glass, but it's a glass tube that has a center it with a very fine flow.\n\n So, you can only get maybe 10 drops in this whole thing, but you're only going to get probably five in there, five or six, and that's all you need.\n\n \r\nThen when it gets down to the cervix, you feel that it's hit, you know, through the cervix you can feel it hit the wall because the ovaries discharge only one per month, fertilizes eggs.\n\n So, let's say it's happening on the right side.\n\n Then those eggs go down the fallopian tube, down to where they need meet the sperm, and they go right up into that surface and that's where they latch on.\n\n \r\nSo, if you scratch, then we get to the mucus lining, and it absorbs that pennyroyal oil.\n\n You'll usually have abortion pretty readily, but with lots of labor pain, most of the time, lots of labor pain.\n\n So, it usually happens in 3-8 days.\n\n That's the only sure way that I know that works 90% of the time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd where can get pennyroyal oil at.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's almost illegal?\n\n You have to get in Canada or somewhere like that.\n\n It's illegal in this country for that reason.\n\n \r\nYou might be able to find it in some states, but in this state it's illegal.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Acrylamides From Cooking Starch \n \n**[2004],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd that was causing his cancer\n\n Cancer can come from the accumulation of all kinds of different poisons.\n\n The Country, a bunch of scientists there and full professors that are no longer full professors because they issued this particular report and put it out to the public before it was reviewed by the authorities that 80% of the cancer out there is because of acrylamides \r\nAcrylamides form when you boil/cook something in oil.\n\n Cereals, doughnuts, potato chips, any kind of chip, soy chips, french fries.\n\n They cause the most cancer.\n\n They wanted to outlaw these foods in Sweden.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nVegetable oils, right.\n\n Not animal fats?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEven animal fats?\n\n If you're boiling something with high starch in it.\n\n  \r\nHigh carbohydrate along with the fat causes the problem.\n\n Of course, it's worse with vegetable oils, but that's the problem.\n\n It creates all these acrylamides, and that creates a lot of cancerous conditions.\n\n  \r\nAll 12 of those professor's lost their tenures, because they went to the media before they let the university research their research.\n\n \r\nNobody's been able to scientifically disprove it.\n\n You've got a lot of medical professionals out there and a lot of pseudo scientists that are arguing against their research, but nobody's coming up with scientific proof like they had the prof, but the cereal industry, those chip industries are trillions of dollars a year.\n\n They're not going to let it happen.\n\n \r\nSo, heart condition.\n\n If you read my second book, we talked about cholesterol is not a factor, that's a myth.\n\n The cholesterol myth, get the book, \"The Cholesterol Myth\".\n\n It identified 90% of all people who have heart attacks have heart attacks when they have low cholesterol levels, and when they got low blood pressure.\n\n The medical profession wants you on drugs.\n\n  \r\nHigh blood pressure is very important.\n\n If you got a cardiac problem, it's what keeps your arteries open.\n\n If you've got a arterial problem or a venous problem, you need high blood pressure or else they cut off and you block circulation.\n\n \r\nThat's what happens with people when they take medication, they end up getting varicose veins, damaged arteries.\n\n They get thrombosis, which are very enlarged vessels that just keep swelling.\n\n All of those are created when you stop high blood pressure with medication.\n\n  \r\nJust remember the medical profession is run by the pharmaceutical industry and they want you to take medication every day and fill their pockets.\n\n \r\nIt's got nothing to do with you getting well.\n\n So, they attack symptoms.\n\n You having high blood pressure is not a symptom of that you should stop that symptom, that body has addressed high blood pressure activity to make sure that you can address your bad circulatory problem.\n\n  \r\nSo, you need fats.\n\n You need high blood pressure if you've got a history of those conditions, but you have to understand that if it's in your family, your family has a tendency to store toxicity in their veins, arteries, and their heart.\n\n You just have to eat properly, so that you don't accumulate toxins, which you're going to store in your heart and artery.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Aluminum Screens On Window \n \n**[2004],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you're talking about aluminum again\n\n Does that mean like aluminum screens on your window.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven aluminum screens on your window will oxidize?\n\n So, if you have somebody take them off, wash it once a year, right after summer, because summer is when they oxidize.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, when is it time that you should do with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou should do it in the fall, November?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow about my screen door.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSame way, they need to be washed down?\n\n So, the oxidized aluminum is off of it.\n\n So, when the wind blows into your house, you're not breathing it in.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI just worried because I have to remove every screen.\n\n I see.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, for the windows, it's easier to remove them.\n\n\r\nIt's easy to wash them, but with the screen door.\n\n You just close your other door and wash the screen door outside.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust with some good water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I would use a degreaser?\n\n The Biokleen degreaser, and some water, that'll help break it down and remove it, and then hose it down.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut the water hosing is chemical water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's no way to get around it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCan I put some water from advanced water and just put some vinegar in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSure, if you want to?\n\n It's expensive, but yeah.\n\n That's the better way.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n You're industrious.\n\n \r\nYeah, well.\n\n I have well water, so I don't have to worry about it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo.\n\n it's in the fall I have to do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOctober, November, late October?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat about now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you should go ahead and get it cleaned before we get the summer winds?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, when should I start to clean it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight away, then October/November clean it again?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOctober, November, and what other months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all you need to do is once a year, right after the hot sunny season?\n\n\r\nEnd of October - 1st of November.\n\n But this year, since you didn't do it last October, November, go ahead and do it now, and then do it again in November.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Alzheimers Caused By Aluminum \n \n**[2004],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI have a big question\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThis is the first person who says- everybody else says I got a little question.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendees]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nThe challenge is, on my father's side of the family.\n\n They all suffer from Alzheimer's and I went with them to the doctor, and he said, \"Don't eat fat, no fat.\n\n\", and then my my mother side, most of the people, they died with half attacks.\n\n I'm trying to do all of these things my way.\n\n \r\nWhat do you suggest, especially for Alzheimer's.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAlzheimer's is mainly caused from aluminum?\n\n Aluminum destroys the Zetta potential.\n\n The Zetta potential is the ability for nutrients to stay suspended in blood, lymph and neurological system.\n\n  \r\nWhat the aluminum does is it attracts the ions away from the protons.\n\n So, all the older nutrients just sedimentate, they just drop.\n\n So, that's what's happens in the blood and the neurological system.\n\n Everything just becomes sediment.\n\n That's what causes the brain not to work properly.\n\n It's mainly aluminum.\n\n If you go on the internet, you'll find out that they estimate at least 80% of Alzheimer's being caused by aluminum.\n\n \r\nThe other is probably mercury.\n\n Since the 1960s aluminum is one of the biggest metals around, sliding doors, chairs, cooking utensils.\n\n It's in vaccines.\n\n Every time you get a vaccine, there's starting thimerosal, aluminum and formaldehyde in it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat about your screen doors.\n\n You should take out the aluminum in the screen doors?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEven screen doors with aluminum?\n\n \r\nIt dusts.\n\n As it oxidizes, it turns into a dust.\n\n So, what happens is things turn into dust.\n\n If you have a aluminum furniture, aluminum anything, it becomes dust, and you inhale it.\n\n  \r\nI remember last year when I was in Florida, I was seeing a man, and he had his daughter and his wife with them.\n\n They were the reasons that he was with me for this console.\n\n He had cancer metastasizing of the lungs, and I shot his irises and blew them up, and I said, you have more aluminum than I've ever seen in anybody, you know.\n\n  \r\nHe was only against this?\n\n He was only there because his daughter and his wife got him to go.\n\n So, as soon as I said that about the aluminum, he you looked at his wife and his daughter and their eyebrows all raised.\n\n He worked in an aluminum factory for 48 years?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Anti Septics On Meat \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, since I've been getting that kind of need, what is the best thing to do for anybody that's done this already\n\n They know about the antiseptics they use?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're eating enough fat with it to bind with those poisons, but you're wasting some of your fats by eating that antiseptic.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI know, but I wanted to know, do I eat any more eggs, maybe 6 eggs are day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're already taking care of it with your diet?\n\n It's just that you would have lost nutrients.\n\n, so it's dispelled with the antiseptic.\n\n Your poisons are already arrested.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut I mean, this fish I bought today here, and there's a pack I bought at home.\n\n What should I do with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just eat your normal fat with it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow much fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust what you're normally eating?\n\n You can only eat so much food in a day.\n\n Much of It's going to go out with the poisons, and not be used to stabilize and make you healthier, but it can prevent damage.\n\n So, as much as you can eat is what you eat and you're eating, you've got a good weight.\n\n\r\nSo, I wouldn't say for you to eat anymore.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Asians Don't Eat Ripe Fruit \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Asians know that, they don't get much meat\n\n Most of the Asians, only about 5 to 10% of their diet is protein.\n\n So, when they eat fruit, it has to be completely green, like a completely green mango, which is really tart and sour, but it gives them enzymes without giving them all the sugar.\n\n\r\nSo, they have to be very careful.\n\n The younger generation is getting programmed with all this garbage information about health and they're eating all this ripe fruit and you there's more muggings, there's more illiteracy.\n\n There's all kinds of problems with the younger generation that the older generation didn't have to suffer because they knew not to eat ripe fruit.\n\n\r\nYou rarely see an Asian over the age of 35 that eats any fresh ripe fruit.\n\n They will always eat it green, but the kids now all the way up to 35 years old, are eating this overripe fruit and they're not happy people.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Bacterial Infections, Stem Cells Inestead Of Bypass \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nCouple of years ago, my dad started coming down with flu like symptoms, and he was stiff and couldn't walk, and he went to the hospital and the doctor said he had a bacterial infection in his heart, and I guess he almost died, and they cut open the sternum and deem like a, take it out and stuff and then it spread to his knee\n\n They said it was endocarditis or something.\n\n I don't know if you have any ideas.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAgain, the bacteria is there to get rid of that decaying tissue.\n\n So, he had to have that in the heart, and that knee for the bacteria to go to that area, to feed, to feast.\n\n \r\nBut the bacteria wasn't the problem, it was the toxicity causing the decaying tissue on which the bacteria fed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n So, now that he has like a pig heart, or part of a pig heart, and the metal stuff in the sternum, what can I do for him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I have partners in Bangkok, which owned the first cardiac stem cell therapy, and what they do is they extract the blood from the person?\n\n They send it to Israel were a laboratory of scientists discovered this, how to separate stem cells that relate to the heart.\n\n Then they breed those cells, they send them back to Bangkok, inject it in the heart area of the person and 85% of the patients out of the last two years in trials, 85% of them regrew- they had their own natural heart bypass.\n\n The body would build a completely new artery to the heart, 85% of the cases.\n\n It's gone so well that the government of Thailand cut the testing down one year.\n\n So, now they can do it commercial.\n\n \r\nAnd the good King's own cardiologists are part of the board of the company, and there are seven Nobel prize winners who have joined the company because of the incredible results.\n\n So, if your father wants his own bypass from his own body where you don't have to worry about rejecting other people's cells or fetus cells or stem cells from the person's own body, get put in there.\n\n  \r\nAnd all the cases, the 15% that it didn't work for, or 16% that didn't work for, there was no ill symptoms.\n\n They just didn't grow the heart valve.\n\n That's an option.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat does that cost.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbout 60,000, which is about half the price of the bypass?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n60,000 American dollars.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou have to go there one for one treatment.\n\n \r\nHow many treatments does it take?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOnly one?\n\n You have to go to Bangkok, they take your blood, they send it to Israel.\n\n They read it there takes 10 days, send it back to Bangkok and inject it in you, and you go.\n\n They can take people who were wheelchairs, three months they're out playing tennis.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou have to pay it in one full balance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't know?\n\n \r\nThey're the ones who are on the primal diet.\n\n The owners of it are the primal diet, and they want to build a primal center to get people to go to the primal center two weeks to four weeks before they have their blood extracted.\n\n So, they think it will work 100%.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDo you have their phone number.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, I do?\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nI don't have mobility, and it's gotten a lot better as time goes on?\n\n Is there anything I can eat to help with the mobility.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, a good diet with lots of raw meat, but if you wrap a piece of meat around there?\n\n \r\nEvery other night, wrap a piece of meat around the entire area from here all the way down to here, wrap it all the way around and it will help it quickly.\n\n Putting fermented coconut oil will help break down the scar tissue here and scar tissue inside.\n\n So, one night you can put on the coconut oil and the next meat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Berries & Coco Cream To Remove Mercury & Aluminum \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've never been able to have a sense of smell since I can remember\n\n Do you know anything about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's usually very damaged olfactory glands?\n\n Often it comes from vaccines, from the aluminum or mercury getting stored in that olfactory gland from a vaccine from an early age.\n\n  \r\nThe only thing I've known to remove the mercury or aluminum is to eat berries.\n\n If it's, mercury, you have to use dark berries, if it's aluminum, you have to use raspberries.\n\n Combination of both of them with coconut cream and some honey, and maybe a little bit of butter and a little bit of dairy cream to help flush it out of the system.\n\n \r\nEating papaya helps bring back senses.\n\n \r\nLet me also address it, just to inhaling a poison.\n\n If you inhaled formaldehyde, for some reason, if you're exposed to formaldehyde, it could damage those sensory glands permanently until you're eating the right foods over a long period of time to get rid of the scar tissue and the poisons that are stuck there, but any kind of inhaled poison can do it too.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Bringing Food On Plane \n \n**[2005],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI mean, either the carry on- \r\n\n \r\nIf it goes through your luggage department, the radiation is a hundred times more than it is for your carry on, so carry it through\n\n It can go through that level of radiation one time only without damaging it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat's not the metal detector.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that's not the metal detector?\n\n \r\nYou walk through the metal detector.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou walk through it with your bag on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey won't let you do that?\n\n It has to go through the scanner.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOh, the scanner is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm saying there's no way they're going to let you do it?\n\n Some people are able to talk security out of it, but not at LAX.\n\n \r\nThey're the biggest Nazi fascists people in the world.\n\n So full of their power.\n\n I go there with a doctor's letter that says my food is my medicine.\n\n I take them from the website for Homeland security, showing that all you have to do is ask them to hand inspect it, if it's your medication.\n\n My doctor's note says my food is my medication, but they will not let me.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhys that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCause they're Nazis?\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nThey don't let anybody have a good reason.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo the less worst is the scanner, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour carry on?\n\n It can go through there one time because the radiation is low level and won't stay long.\n\n \r\nWhen you put it through your check-in luggage that is heavy, heavy radiation.\n\n 100x higher.\n\n Cause they have to x-ray thick baggage, and if you've got, photographic material from movie Edison, and a company shipping stuff.\n\n \r\nIt's got to go through a lot of heavy stuff, even through metal.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Brushing Teeth \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom the brain, it will cause the teeth to abraise, and you'll bruise the dentine more, and then you'll have teeth decay\n\n\r\nAgain, decay doesn't come from bacteria, that bacteria results from the decaying of the gum cells from the dentine from the damage of the poisoned minerals, the free radicals that have damaged the live cell.\n\n Dentine is a live cell, bones a live cell If it's damaged by a free radical metal, like mercury or aluminum, that cell is damaged.\n\n Bacteria results to eat the decay.\n\n \r\nBacteria is not the problem.\n\n The bacteria is a result of the disease, of the damage.\n\n Just like you find a carcass out there, the vultures and crows come to eat up the decay.\n\n They didn't call us the decay, they're a response of the decay.\n\n That is very important to understand that we should not fear bacteria, parasites, and virus anymore.\n\n\r\nWe need to prevent ourselves from consuming, whether it's breathing or eating or drinking as many pollutants as possible refrain from eating pollutants.\n\n Refrain from  breathing and drinking pollutants that causes degenerative tissue, that is disease.\n\n So, when you have those heavy metals coming into the sinuses, it takes, let's say you've got one molecule of mercury or one molecule of the aluminum, it takes 2000 fat-\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Bycycling & Prostate Cancer \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnytime you would exercise and get circulation into an area, as long as you have good nutrients in your in your blood and, and intestines, it's going to aid any disease\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there any truth to that, she said about prostate cancer and riding bicycles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou mean that it would harm?\n\n\r\nIf you've got a seat that puts pressure on that and blocks circulation to that, yes?\n\n\r\nYeah, but if you can get those seats that will rest on those two bones and you're not pressing up in the prostate area right here, then it's fine.\n\n Cause when you've got that, horn coming through there, I had to cut my off and I lived off of a bicycle for nine years.\n\n I would refuse to get into a car.\n\n\r\nA horn.\n\n You've got the seat that goes like this, okay.\n\n You've got this penis thing, this horn, I cut it off?\n\n So, I didn't have it riding up my crotch all that time.\n\n Well, now they developed seats just have those two things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Chemicals On Meat \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe extra pollution, all the more chemicals we have, you go into a restaurant, you go buy your meat\n\n Do you know what the protocol in California is.\n\n You wash an item, you rinse it, and then you have to dip it in an antiseptic, which is a poison?\n\n So, every time you eat something from a store, a regular store, you're getting a chemical antibacterial agent in your food.\n\n That's why a lot of people were complaining about their meat and fish tasting like soap, because that's exactly what it is, and nobody's stopping these health authorities from doing this, and you have to understand that every health official is a doctor.\n\n So, they believe that bacteria, virus, and parasites are your problem.\n\n \r\nBut we've been living with parasites and bacteria for millions of years.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDoes that go for health foods, the fish that you buy there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's right?\n\n If you want it cut, when I go in there to have something, I say, I want something out of the refrigerator.\n\n I want you to hose that counter off.\n\n I want you to hose the knife off, and I want you to cut it without any antiseptic.\n\n \r\nCause they have a thing they dip their knives in that has the antiseptic in it, and they dip it and they cut, they dip it and they cut.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nA lot of people didn't know about those things until you just brought it up now.\n\n I mean I'm talking about Whole Foods is a health store.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's Wild Oats, it's everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs that a law now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's a law?\n\n It's not a true law.\n\n It's a regulation of the state of California Health Department.\n\n I just got some money, so I'm going to file suit within the next four months to stop it, and let me tell you, it's going to make a lot of waves.\n\n There's going to be a lot of nasty things going on, but I'm going to shout it loud and clear.\n\n \r\nSomebody gave me a $25,000 donation to be able to do it.\n\n I don't know how far it's going to take it, but at least we can get it out there and get started on it because I'm going to try to get an injunction against it.\n\n  \r\nI'm also going to try to get an injunction against the federal government for the law that no commercial juice can be raw.\n\n It has to be pasteurized or irradiated.\n\n So, I'm going to try to get an injunction against that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, in other words, you have to tell them before they cut it- shouldn't buy the Rocky chicken that's underneath that other chicken if it was cut with a certain knife.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay?\n\n The boards that they cut on, they take a sponge, and they wash it down with something.\n\n \r\nThen they don't rinse it with clean water.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThat water is chemical.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey have buckets there with that stuff in, and also, they have filters that puts the antiseptic right into their water?\n\n It goes into that area.\n\n So, you have to tell them you want that board washed with clean tap water that has no antibacterial in it, no detergents in it whatsoever.\n\n No antiseptic.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd the knife too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd the knife too, tell them it has to be rinsed and no antiseptic on it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThat's the main thing.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI like getting my meat from James' place because they don't use any of that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIt's just when you run out, you have to run to the store to get the fish.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Coconut Oil & Where To Buy \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's the fermented coconut oil\n\n You have to get the one that says fermented coconut oil.\n\n Not from James, he only has one coconut oil.\n\n He has coconut cream, that's refrigerated, but the coconut oil that looks like Crisco when it's cool.\n\n That is fermented coconut oil from Thailand.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThat's good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's great, and the one now that they just changed their process in the last three weeks for me?\n\n So, now we can buy that off the internet.\n\n It's cheaper.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the difference between fermented, and non fermented.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they make it centrifugally spun, the molecules in that are much harder, and larger, so it's harder to digest?\n\n So, when it's fermented, and it was only fermented for about 12 to something like 19 hours, that's all.\n\n Just to get the oil to separate from the cream.\n\n Cause there's still lectins in there that needs to separate from new oil.\n\n\r\nSo, that takes fermentation to do it a natural way that's more digestible, and utilizable.\n\n The one with the larger molecule that's centrifugally spun, harder molecule, doesn't absorb into the skin, the skin can break can't down with its own enzymes very well.\n\n It's a more difficult oil, but it's just as expensive to get the one that can be utilized better, which is the fermented.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Cold Pressed Coconut Oil \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's not a fermented, completely cold pressed\n\n In their process, they steam or boil the coconut before they press it.\n\n I've gone to every one of them, and I said, I want it in writing from your producer, not from the wholesaler or the retailer I want it from the producer.\n\n  \r\nSo, I go right to the people who make it, and I say, I want to know your process and you have to give it to me in writing, and there's only one company that did.\n\n All the other companies' statements.\n\n Well, we do heat it to 170 - 215 ° before we cold press it.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nI say, why do you call it unheated, and cooked.\n\n \r\n\"Well, during the process we don't\", and I said, \"that's deceiving the people\"?\n\n  \r\nSo, I put it out on the internet, everybody was false.\n\n Now this company, the only thing that they were doing wrong, this one company was a fermented coconut oil.\n\n They would heat it up a little higher temperature than I wanted.\n\n  \r\nSo, they brought that down and they were also rinsing it with chlorinated water before they pressed and fermented it.\n\n So, I got them to take the chlorine out of the water and use good well water.\n\n So, now it's good stuff.\n\n**[Not good anymore],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow much is theirs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't remember, but it's cheaper to fly from the Philippines than it is from Thailand?\n\n It's a very long distance, very expensive, but I still like the taste of the one from Thailand better than Philippines.\n\n I mean, this is very tasty stuff from James.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Detox & High Meat \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI noticed in your second book you recommended not to take high meat during detoxification\n\n Is that right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nif you're already detoxifying, I don't suggest it for some reaso?\n\n I mean, you can do it.\n\n I have people who do it, but\r\nSome people, it causes more vomiting, stuff like that.\n\n So, I don't suggest it for that reason.\n\n I didn't want people to freak out.\n\n \r\nYeah, I do it, and I know lots of people that do it, but I know some people that freaked out when they had it during a detox.\n\n Caused massive diarrhea, and vomiting, which is not a bad thing, but for them it was enough to scare them off the diet.\n\n\r\nJust completely stopped the diet, not just the high meat.\n\n So, you know, I stayed away from that problem because even if it happens and only 5% of the people it's too much.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Detoxing Throuhg Teeth, Teeth Pain, Pain Formula \n \n \n \n \n### (20) Diabetes Cured From Raw Milk \n \n**[2005]**\n\r\nHippocrates fed all of anybody who had diabetes a raw milk diet, and they got rid of it in two weeks,\n\n Diabetes rid of in two weeks on an all raw milk diet that was not refrigerated milk that was straight out of the cow, non-refrigerated milk.\n\n So, if you do nowadays, it may take six weeks to get rid of diabetes.\n\n\r\nHowell, and a lot of other doctors did it throughout the 1800s, and early 1900s, it's even done at Mayo clinic.\n\n\r\nWell, when the pharmaceutical industries took over the universities and the medical schools, it all became about taking medication rather than curing and healing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Fermented Coconut \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCoconuts are 80% fat, 15% protein and 5% sugars, but it's different fermented\n\n That's fine fermented, overly ripe.\n\n It will help just cleanse you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you eat a lot of fat with fermented fruit that's not the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt will make more soaps for cleansing, so if you can handle an intense detoxification, that's fine?\n\n Not for you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd if it still tastes too sour for you the pineapple, very rank.\n\n Can you have honey with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you can have as much honey as you want, as long as you're eating enough meat?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Food Colorings & Flavorings, Vegetale Oils Resings Etc \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI always talk about something that I've done over the years, just to give you more understanding of what's happening in your body\n\n  \r\nWhen you ate syrups and a soda pops and all of that, all of those flavored oils that they gave you in those drinks, and syrups, jams and jellies where they increase the flavor or put flavoring in candy.\n\n It was a resin.\n\n  \r\nIt's a resin from vegetable oil.\n\n That's what causes almost 98% of all the stones, whether the kidney stones, gallbladder stones, urinary tract stones, whatever develops it's from those food oils.\n\n \r\nHow you can break them down and get them out of the body is by mixing coconut cream with a little vinegar, lemon juice and pineapple, and you put those together and you might start passing sand, and if you had those little grains analyzed, you would find out which you were discarding.\n\n \r\nI hadn't done it in a long time, so I started doing it a few months ago, and I was a big syrup eater with pancakes, and that's what it was.\n\n The crystalized resins from the syrup that I ate so much of, and also one of the crystals that came out was from boysenberry syrup that I used to love with waffles.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, coconut cream, lemon, vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd you can put an egg in that, just if somebody is too thin, and doesn't have enough protein, you should put an egg in it too?\n\n \r\nThat will help eliminate some crystals in your system that block proper cellular functioning, whether it's in the gland or kidneys, and most often those do store around the kidneys, and the bladder.\n\n That's why they dump so often into there, and if you had that formula, let's say once a month, once every three weeks, when you develop the stones, they won't be large ones, they'll be smaller.\n\n \r\nIf they get too large, it makes it difficult to pass urine and makes you feel like you always want to urinate, and then you have to force it to get the sand through.\n\n  \r\nIt's a good time of the year.\n\n This time of the year in between January and in June is a good time to detoxify the sand, and stones from the resins.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Hand Pain = Antibiotic Poisons, Penicillin, Moldy Berries \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'd like to talk about my left hand here a little bit\n\n For a year or so, I had pain from here down to my hand, and it was up and down.\n\n Sometimes missing, sometimes serious, and I asked you about it about a month ago, and you told me about hot water bottles.\n\n So, I started using hot water bottles.\n\n Probably not very smart, but I went to sleep with my hand on a hot water bottle, and it's pretty much just concentrated in the hand.\n\n\r\nBut it feels like the sensation it's like crushed sometimes, now it's advancing and it stings or feels crushed, and then for a few days it wont hurt, and then it will come back real serious.\n\n\r\nI thought it was a bruise, so I held onto some steak for awhile, and that would seem to calm down, but if I over did it, it wouldn't do anything about it.\n\n \r\nI've been known to detox one way or another.\n\n I'm not shocked by this particularly, but I would like it to not hurt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, mainly when you have that kind of a pain, it's antibiotic poisons, which stores in immune antibodies, so living in the joints, and they throw off a very nasty toxic.\n\n If  they're allowed to get active again, and they often do.\n\n**[unclear]**\n in my thumbnail, and the whole thumb, and I had the pus analyzed, and it came up from penicillin.\n\n The byproducts of the penicillin toxicity, and that caused severe pain for about 18 months off and on in that thumb.\n\n\r\nI've had lots of penicillin, lots of antibiotics in my childhood, and I used to get joint pains.\n\n I ended up with bone cancer as a product of that, as part of a product of that thing.\n\n When I had the radiation therapy that sealed it.\n\n The two compounds together caused the bone cancer.\n\n Blood and bone cancer.\n\n So, getting rid of that is not easy.\n\n\r\nEating moldy berries.\n\n Whole moldy berries, let's say you ate three of them a day, every other day for about six weeks, you could help destroy those molds.\n\n\r\nAlways eat it with an egg because when those toxins start being released, it can cause soreness and bruising.\n\n Like you're having the feeling here, like everything is bruised and sore.\n\n You don't have enough of particular kinds of fat to bind with those particular byproducts.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Hereditary Disease \n \n \n \n \n### (25) Home Renovation, Milk Paint \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThe home renovation, painting interiors\n\n What products to use.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, when I've done that, I used to be a painter?\n\n So, when I would paint, I would always wear big gas masks that they used in wars.\n\n You know, I got these Israeli gas masks, and these two HEPA filters on it, plus charcoal cartridges, and I painted that way.\n\n And then I went away for five days and left three heaters in each room to cook it.\n\n With very little cracks in the window, so just enough air could pass out to where it wouldn't catch the house on fire, but it baked everything in.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, it can outgas for a year.\n\n If it's oil paint, it'll outgas for five years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, that will solve your problems.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, there's milk paint made out of casein from milk?\n\n You have to mix it yourself, and it's a lot less toxic, but again, you still need to bake it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI can find somebody else to do my painting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd you could do what I used to do when I used to decorate and do painting.\n\n I would go to the colleges, and get art students, and I would teach them how to model and do designs and walls and everything pay them a very little fee, but they got credit for doing that kind of work cause it was like a work credit thing they got.\n\n \r\nSo I could pay them $7 - $8 an hour, and they'd be doing $50 an hour - $100 an hour work because that's what I charge.\n\n Sometimes I charge $200 an hour, depends upon the client.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) How We Get Disease & Contagions \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow do you get sick\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou get sick from poisons in the body?\n\n  \r\nHer problem is she wants to know about disease, how we get disease, and about contagions.\n\n  \r\nThe new book, the revision of the first book has all that explanation in detail that I wasn't allowed to give the first publication of it.\n\n I explained exactly what virus are, I explained exactly what causes disease.\n\n How the whole logic of contagion is misconstrued for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n \r\nAnd now of course, the medical industry, because they make fortunes on it.\n\n When you look at any of the medical manuals, they're written by Merck and Bayer.\n\n \r\nAnd they want you to live with your disease and take medication.\n\n Every disease they want to look at like diabetes.\n\n So, you take it medicine every day to live with your disease, and instead of cure it, yet the father of medicine Hippocrates.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Human Growth Hormone \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIn anti-aging, they talk about HGH\n\n Basically, as you get older, it's diminishes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHGH is made by the human body only.\n\n The chemical they sell, it's not human growth hormone.\n\n  \r\nIt's a chemical process that mimics growth hormone.\n\n It's chemically made in a laboratory.\n\n Sometimes we're taking it from like a wheat grass.\n\n \r\nThey will take the growth hormone from the wheat grass and call it human growth hormone after they chemically alter it.\n\n  \r\nBut it's still a chemical that has nothing to do with human growth hormone.\n\n The only way you can get your own growth hormone is to continue is to eat raw meat.\n\n \r\nI'm doing pretty well for getting on 60 for somebody who is supposed to be dead at 21.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Humidifier \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWould a humidifier relieve you temporarily\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA humidifier is good, as long as you're using good water?\n\n Don't use tap water.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Instinctive Diet Fruit \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd she went on the diet after she investigated, and researched it, but then she was on the diet for two years, doing very, very well\n\n She's a very ultra skinny person.\n\n She got on some weight, and then she believed that that, instincto was more natural, and I said, but you're not in a natural environment.\n\n\r\nIt's too toxic to be in a natural instinctive diet, and also your instincts aren't true.\n\n\r\nAnd she died a year after being on that diet.\n\n She got so skinny.\n\n She wasted away, and got fatigued and died.\n\n \r\nInstincto is everything has to smell good for them to eat it.\n\n If it doesn't smell good, they won't eat it.\n\n\r\nSo, 60% of their diet is fruit.\n\n Tears the body to pieces.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about fruitarians.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTheir teeth are rotting away, their bones are disappearing?\n\n There are very few of them who do well beyond seven years.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're so skinny, \r\n\n\r\nAnd they're very overly emotional and they don't think very clearly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Irregular Heartbeat \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI have atrial fibrillation\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat's that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIrregular heartbeat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's when the atrium beats faster, it flutters.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd that's good.\n\n Your heart's dancing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's been dancing steady for two years, irregular.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMy father, he was diagnosed with it when he was 62 years old, he had a smart doctor and he said, \"Stop counting\".\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou mean it's called, \"A Regular Heartbeat\".\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIrregular heartbeat, it beats very rapidly, sometimes you're in arrhythmia happens where it beats rapidly, and then it'll beat a bit, miss a beat and go rapidly?\n\n Again, it was just irregular heartbeat, but usually rapid heartbeat is a part of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRapid isn't part of mine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYours is always rapid, you have no cessation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo, it's not rapid?\n\n It's irregular.\n\n It's caused by the atrial fibrillation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but that's not a bad thing.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, according to the cardiologist- \r\n\n \r\nThe cardiologist is trying to make his money.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, no.\n\n I don't do any drugs.\n\n I don't go to cardiologists, but when I did they wanted to put me on coumadin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's right, they want to put you on drugs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI said, no, I'm not going to do rat poison.\n\n What they did instead- I have a holistic doctor, and it's fish oil, and some things so the blood doesn't coagulate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCoagulation is not a fibrillation problem.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about C0Q10.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, that's another?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAgain, those are all chemicals.\n\n Those are manmade chemicals.\n\n They're not made by the body.\n\n Your body makes your own C0Q10, but they don't sell what the body makes.\n\n They do in the chemistry lab.\n\n \r\nIt's an entirely different substance.\n\n It has no vitamins, no enzymes attached to it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, the theory is that we have this condition.\n\n We're more likely to get a stroke.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat is absolute fiction.\n\n There's no evidence to prove that.\n\n That's a hypothesis without any basis of proof, and if you read \"The Cholesterol Myth\", you'll read a lot of the fallacies about heart conditions that are attributed to that.\n\n \r\nThe fish oil is good idea because the muscles need fat.\n\n However, you cannot get a non-purified fish oil that isn't purified with a chemical solvent, and the FDA requires it to get it into this country.\n\n So, even if it's from Norway, it is all purified, chemically purified.\n\n It is a toxic substance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, what oils would be the same as fish oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nButter, and fish, eating butter and fish together is great?\n\n \r\nMy father is now 89 this year, and he's at that atrial fibrillation now for 27 years.\n\n  \r\nNo problems.\n\n Never had a surgery.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Kidney Function, Urine Vs Blood \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI do, it's about kidneys?\n\n My mother just got diagnosed that her left kidney is completely not working, and her right kidney is 30% working.\n\n \r\nIs there anything I can do to get it working.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat formula right there helps get the crystals- the resins out of the kidney that stops them from functioning, unless she's got some other poison in there?\n\n \r\nWhat was her diet like.\n\n \r\nThe sad diet?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShe probably got a lot of poison, so who knows what's in there.\n\n That could be a start?\n\n As long as she has one kidney function, that's good.\n\n \r\nYeah.\n\n I would suggest that drink then.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about eating kidney.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFor most people who have kidney problems, the high ammonia causes them to get jaundice?\n\n You can try it.\n\n Doesn't always work.\n\n Once they've been on the diet for about a year, year and a half, then they can eat the kidney then.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, you have ammonia, let's say it goes into the muscle meat or something.\n\n \r\nIt's like a cleanser.\n\n Isn't it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nPeople have trouble to even taste it, it's so strong.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI know.\n\n That's why people have trouble drinking urine.\n\n Cause the only difference between blood, and urine is that there's ammonia, and very few red blood cells.\n\n Otherwise, the contents of the urine is identical to the blood.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Mercury & Aluminum & Dry Mouth - Fat,Honey,Butter \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, the aluminum, it takes 2000 fat cells or about 1000 white blood cells to harness, and address that\n\n  \r\nHow many do you think can surround one molecule.\n\n Not much?\n\n So, it all dries out.\n\n All the fats in here are very minimal, you can keep fats everywhere in your body, but it isn't easy to keep that in the face.\n\n \r\nThere are some people that can, but they get up to 250, 300 pounds before they get a lot of excess weight in the face.\n\n You cannot have that much fat in your face to deal with that much poisons.\n\n So, you're going to have dryness, you're going to have dry mouth for 40 years, dry mouth is not dehydration.\n\n \r\nThat's the minerals coming out and using all the fats in your face, and surrounding area.\n\n That leaves the mouth dry.\n\n  \r\nThat's why I say honey, and butter in your mouth, let that stay in there, let the fat reabsorb, and you'll say, oh gosh, I didn't drink any water, and I don't have dry mouth, and I don't feel dehydrated.\n\n \r\nIt's got nothing to do with dehydration.\n\n It's delipidization in here.\n\n That's a very bad thing because you got the greatest amount of the most toxic poisons in your brain, and you've got the least amount of fat in your brain.\n\n \r\nThat's why there's so many stupid youth.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nVoted for bush *Laughs*.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIf anyone wants to order brain from the buffalo, just let me know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI just ate rotten buffalo brain.\n\n Let it go really ripe, didn't refrigerate it and let it get really nasty.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSwallowed it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBlended it with milk, and honey?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nBut its not cheap.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, it's expensive.\n\n \r\nIt's about $35 for a half a brain.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Naps Are Good \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEverybody should do that\n\n That's the normal cycle of every animal on this planet, and insects.\n\n They all midday take a nap.\n\n That's why Mexico makes it a law.\n\n Siesta is a law, not anymore in the big companies, because now America has gone down infiltrated the commercial division, but all your little villages, it was a law to take a siesta\r\nAbsolutely take a nap.\n\n Even John F.\n\n Kennedy did.\n\n There's an hour a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes Bush.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know?\n\n I rather doubt it.\n\n Speeches are too good.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) No Dairy&Meat, What To Eat, No Fried Food \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat would be the best diet for someone won't eat raw meat, and can't get raw dairy, what should they eat dying\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDie?\n\n  \r\nEat lots of eggs, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRaw eggs?\n\n  \r\nIn terms of the other foods, which should they stay away from, and which should they eat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends upon the individual?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, there's really no food other than eggs, there's no really better diet if you're not going to eat raw food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n Well, stay away from fried food.\n\n That's the worst food in the world.\n\n Any fried food, stir fry, doesn't matter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Nuts & Seeds - Phytic Acid \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOne time you said you talking about nuts\n\n They have enzyme inhibitors.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPhytic acid, all nuts and seeds.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, that was my question.\n\n Seeds have that too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll nuts, and seeds have phytic acid?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you eat an apple and ate the seed, is it too little to make it a problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not a really a problem with a few apple seeds, and also the phytic acid becomes more active once the seed is dried?\n\n\r\nSo, if you're eating a fresh apple seed, that doesn't have as much of a reaction.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you did want to eat some seeds, if you just combined it with a similar stuff that you use in the nut formula, that will neutralize the phytic acid, but I've done experiments where you eat the foods with the nuts.\n\n Doesn't work for a lot of people, you have to blend it in.\n\n You have to blend the nuts until they were a powder, and then add the ingredients and blend it all together for most people.\n\n So, if you eat the nuts with some eggs, and some honey and some butter and you get gas, you start not digesting very well, and stuff starts slowing down, you got a phytic problem and you have to make the nut formula or seed formula, whatever you're doing.\n\n It has to be blended together, and you just eating them together doesn't work for you.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nNow, what should I do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet me finish?\n\n Did you get everything answered with that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, but if let's say you ate some seeds, and you just ate it separately, but there's no  gas?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo problem, then you can handle it that way.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut originally you said it was an enzyme inhibitor.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEnzyme inhibitors?\n\n\r\nThe phytic acid is an enzyme inhibitor.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nThat makes the meat not as good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt prevents you from digesting protein, utilizing protein for 24 to 36 hours?\n\n\r\nNot only the protein in the nuts or seeds, but any protein from the eggs or meat that you eat.\n\n It interferes with everything.\n\n\r\nNot unless you're having the nut formula.\n\n I say it's very important to have a once a week to handle the neurological byproduct poisons that you have in your body.\n\n\r\nEvery time you've gone through a traumatic experience or anxiety, you manufacturer hormones, psychological hormones.\n\n They are byproducts of toxins, just like any other hormone in the body, stores just like any other hormone in the body.\n\n \r\nWhen they are released into the blood and neurological system, the same emotional experience that you went through during that trauma or anxiety is relooked, it's remembered\r\nIf you want to know the scientific basis for that, get on the internet.\n\n Look under L Nora van Winkle's, \"The Biology of Emotions\".\n\n There's a very long, profound technical with all the chemistry.\n\n Elnora E L O R N A, Van Winkle, V A N - W I N K L E.\n\n\r\nThe Biology of Emotions.\n\n There's a layman paper, and there's a very technical page.\n\n She was a woman who spent 47 years cataloging every chemical in the brain, and nervous system at Columbia University, New York City.\n\n That was her entire life, and when she retired, she had addressed every chemical in the brain and nervous.\n\n\r\nShe was the one that by some of my research that I found from analyzing vomit, blood, and chemistry secretion, I found neurological hormonal sites that were addressed with psychology, and she addressed it and she went on the diet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Oils \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nVery little, like I said, in the book, you have maybe two ounces of olive oil or flax oil or coconut oil, fermented coconut oil, you know, maybe six ounces a week, seven ounces at the most\n\n  \r\nIf you're a big guy, you can have seven or eight ounces a week, but with only three meat meals.\n\n \r\nLet's say you want a detoxification formula, let's say for cancer, you might put coconut oil, and some pineapple with some lemon juice, but that's to get the tumor to start dissolving.\n\n \r\nAfter it's already dissolved, you don't want that kind of a thing except to get the byproducts.\n\n So, you don't want that every day once you get to the tumors and start dissolving.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Oils, Viruses&Bacteria&Parasites Breaking Down Toxicity \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnytime you have a concentrated oil, a product of something where the concentrated fats are in a liquid form\n\n  \r\nCoconut will get a hard at a very high temperature of 70°.\n\n Coconut oil will still solidify like Crisco oil, but most of your oils stay pretty liquid.\n\n As long as they're not refrigerated, drop below 60 degrees, 55 degrees.\n\n \r\nThose oils are mainly solvent active in the body.\n\n The body will make soaps with them.\n\n They don't stabilize the body.\n\n They don't increase mobility.\n\n They don't help lubricate.\n\n They don't calm the system.\n\n They're there to help dissolve poisons in the system like we use the degreasers.\n\n  \r\nThe body can make a lot of degreasers, and a lot of compounds to dissolve the toxicity that we can't use the bacteria parasites to do it.\n\n \r\nWe have to use virus because the tissue is too contaminated.\n\n The poisons in the cells are so poisonous if the bacteria, parasites eat those cells, it kills them.\n\n So, the only thing left is virus.\n\n solvents; soaps to cleanse and break down those by solvent process.\n\n  \r\nAnd if you want to get an idea of the difference in the viability of using the different substances, let's say you had a dog, and you had all restaurant, and you had all of this waste that you weren't allowed to throw in the garbage can, you need an animal to eat it.\n\n \r\nSo, you've got a big dog that eats a hundred times in a day, and it ends up having a turd 1.\n\n5 pounds the next day.\n\n That's what parasites, and bacteria do.\n\n They consume massive amounts of their weight in a 24-hour period and leave very little waste product.\n\n When your body uses a virus or any other kind of a solvent, what happens when you take a solvent, you dilute it, you clean the area, you have a whole bucket of waste that will spread throughout the entire body environment.\n\n \r\nThat's why cerebral meningitis is bad and, and spinal meningitis is bad because it's viral.\n\n  \r\nThe medical profession doesn't freak out as much if it's bacterial because you don't have all that swelling in the brain and nervous system with bacterial infection, a detoxification of the nervous system, and brain as you do with a virus, it spreads all this fluid, contaminated fluid.\n\n \r\nCauses more pain, more likelihood of paralysis.\n\n  \r\nSo, eating oils helps the body cleans poisons that cannot be degenerated by bacteria, and parasites.\n\n When I had the chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n I never got a bacteria.\n\n I never got bacterial infection or a parasitical infection since those days up until this last year.\n\n \r\nGot a parasite for the first time, I celebrated.\n\n All of a sudden, all of that pyloroplasty that they did on me when I was 20 years old, they took the duodenum, stretched it to 3x its size.\n\n What happens when you take tissue, and you stretch it and rip it like that 40% scar tissue within the first year, 80% scar tissue within five years from that.\n\n \r\nSo, 80% of my duodenum was scar tissue.\n\n What the hell was the point of stretching the duodenum.\n\n It's pretty absurd, but that's what they did?\n\n  \r\nWhen I got the parasite.\n\n All of a sudden, I started detoxing duodenum, it's working, and it hadn't worked since I was 20 years old, and I just started my 59 years today.\n\n \r\nFinally working after all this time because I was able to get a parasite to help me.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, you're able to digest your food now better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm able to digest?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nDo you have hydrochloric acid, it's going now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I didn't say that?\n\n The duodenum.\n\n The hydrochloric acids in the stomach.\n\n The bile and a lot of other enzymes dump into the stomach, and taking an enzyme is transferring it to the pancreas.\n\n \r\nPancreas restructures the enzyme for our abilities and natures, then dumps it back into the duodenum, and other parts of the intestine.\n\n \r\nSo, that's what came back.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Organic Vs Non Organic Cucumber & Peeling Cucumbers Erections \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf it's organic, I put the whole cucumber, the peel and all, if it's not waxed\n\n It can be called organic, and they still wax it, FDA has allowed them to do that.\n\n So, I can tell, you take a cucumber, take a non-cerated, like paring knife.\n\n You scrape it gently.\n\n  \r\nIf wax comes off of it, and you put it in your fingers, it dissolves and goes away.\n\n That's its natural wax.\n\n Same as an apple.\n\n If you, if that gets waxy and stays.\n\n That's plastic.\n\n That's paraffin wax.\n\n That's an artificial wax.\n\n  \r\nIf a man can't get hard very easily, do not use the peel, peel it.\n\n If you're having problems with erections, if you have that formula without the pineapple in it, and let's say three to three cups of cucumber, it'll help erection.\n\n \r\nKeep erections, unless you keep the peel for some reason, there's an enzyme in it that causes it not to get hardness to the penis.\n\n So, don't use the peel if you want to be hard, if you're going to do that.\n\n Just peel the cucumber and use that.\n\n \r\nWomen don't have to worry about that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Pinworms, Tapeworms \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n \r\nAll those that you can find in fish\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPinworms.\n\n \r\nI've eaten thousands of them and didn't get them.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWould it help anybody to eat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIf anybody's interested, I can get a monkfish liver.\n\n If they want to get a pinworm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut I ate a pinworm infested pound of salmon.\n\n It was undulating, must've been at least 10 million eggs in there.\n\n I ate it, and I didn't one pinworm.\n\n \r\nCause all the chemo and radiation poisoning.\n\n So, I wasn't able to breed one however, in other sick animals that I fed the parasites.\n\n I could not get them to breed a parasite from eating the meat.\n\n So, it's rather a myth.\n\n  \r\nThe way the Joel Weinstock did it was he put the whip worm eggs in Gatorade, which is highly alkalinize.\n\n So, they drank the eggs from the whip worm, and it went into their intestines, and when it went through their stomach, the hydrochloric acid was neutralized by the Gatorade.\n\n So, the eggs are able to survive that tract, so they were able to breed in the intestine.\n\n \r\nI never gave an animal Gatorade with these whip worms because that's not natural.\n\n So, you can't naturally get it.\n\n It has to be an element again, of our industrial society that can allow you to pass into the stomach and intestines without being dissolved by the hydrochloric acid.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Protein Deficiency Causing Poor Sleep  7Depression \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nProtein, raw protein\n\n Most people can't sleep because they're protein deficient.\n\n  \r\nMost people get depressed because they're protein deficient, although that I said in the first book, I said it was majorly a sugar problem.\n\n So, I said have lots of honey, eggs, together to go to sleep.\n\n \r\nBut that would mainly cause such a high sugar level that it just knocked people out.\n\n You know, like you have a candy, and you go on a high, and an hour or two later you crash.\n\n So, that's basically what I would force people into.\n\n It was a quick way to do it.\n\n \r\nMost people, if you say it's a protein deficiency, they need lots of raw eggs, and raw meat, they don't do it.\n\n \r\nBut that is the major reason.\n\n It's the protein.\n\n If you aren't able to digest, and utilize the protein that you were eating before, it would keep you from sleeping properly.\n\n Now that you're eating a meat and almost everybody can digest, 99% of the people I've seen can digest raw meat, period.\n\n 99.\n\n9%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nProtein, does that also mean fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAny kind of meat, yes?\n\n There are some people where there's a sleep center in the brain that gets damaged from vaccines, some other poisoning.\n\n Then it doesn't have anything to do with protein deficiency.\n\n They just can't sleep.\n\n I know one fellow, he was the designer and developer of Piper Aircraft, I was a good friend of the Piper family.\n\n \r\nThis man got really tired one time, and a propeller backed up, and cut his head off, top of his head, hit the sleep center.\n\n He hasn't slept in 36 years.\n\n He has no trouble.\n\n He doesn't get fatigued or doesn't get tired.\n\n He goes all day long and he's not bad, real effected?\n\n \r\nHe rests, but he never sleeps \r\nFor him, it's fine.\n\n It's fine for him.\n\n Most people it isn't.\n\n Most people would turn out to be George Bush and go bomb a country.\n\n \r\nYou can tell I like George Bush.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Raw Cream To Calm The Nerves \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, let's say you've got a nerve irritant, then it can be a matter of eating raw cream\n\n\r\nThen you needed both, the protein and the cream.\n\n The raw cream is the best to soothe the nervous system.\n\n \r\nIf you find yourself uptight and rigid.\n\n You go drink a cup of raw cream, and you'll be relaxed within a few hours.\n\n\r\nGrowing pains.\n\n\r\nThat's a protein deficiency, and a fat deficiency?\n\n He's got to eat a lubrication formula with it.\n\n The lubrication formula in the recipe book.\n\n \r\nYou're going to get that when we go out.\n\n Just have them have that during the eating of the meat, not just after.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Ripe Vs Green Pineapple, Killer Monkeys \n \n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs there a difference between ripe pineapple, and green pineapple\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHe asked if there's a difference between ripe pineapple, and green pineapple?\n\n  \r\n\r\nYes.\n\n  \r\n\r\nPineapple will cause more over emotionality when it's ripe than any other fruit besides banana.\n\n Banana when it's brown ripe, and pineapple, when it's yellow ripe, almost fermented.\n\n It will cross more over emotionality than any other food.\n\n \r\n\r\nAlso fermented figs will do that, but most people don't eat fermented figs, but a lot of people eat overripe pineapple, and overripe bananas.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of what happens in the body, you take a look at the apes, they will only eat green bananas, and they eat the rind with it.\n\n These eat the peel, everything on it.\n\n \r\n\r\nI can't do it.\n\n It's too astringent, and too alimony tasting.\n\n They're used to it; they have more salivary juices.\n\n The monkeys when they eat bananas, they eat them ripe, and you notice that you get a chimpanzee or any kind of a squirrel monkey.\n\n The first thing in the morning they're really calm.\n\n You give them a ripe banana and they'll just be erratic and screaming most of the day.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe killer monkeys, before they go on a kill binge, they will go on a fruit binge They eat all these overripe fermented guavas and figs, and bananas for 24 hours before they go on a killing spree and then they'll go out and kill all kinds of other monkeys and other animals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnything in their path, they'll slaughter them for 24 hours.\n\n As long as that sugar is eating on their brain, nervous system.\n\n Cause the sugars actually eat into the myelin to get the fats because the sugars are looking for fats to interact with.\n\n If it can't find it, it goes into the nervous system, and that's what happens.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, the green pineapple is high in enzymes and not high in sugar.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen any fruit is ripe, you're going to have a high amount of sugar, and you're going to have irritation to the nervous system if you're not fat, and don't have a lot of fat in your blood, and you're going to have over emotionality.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nEat it green.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEat it green?\n\n Get it as hard as you can get it, as green as you can get it, and as white inside as you can get it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAll fruit.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (43) Smallpox \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYes\n\n When, when the friendly Europeans came over here, and took the land away from the Indians, they were killing them with bullets and whatever they had.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFormaldehyde.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey found that they killed more Indians with the white man's diseases', and today the Europeans all get chickenpox when they're in kindergarten.\n\n Was there some relationship.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, that was a myth that was propagated?\n\n \r\nJust like in Brazil, the British government, and this was documented.\n\n \r\nI forgot the fellow's name.\n\n He wrote a play called savages, and this was in Brazil.\n\n  \r\nThey would pay these men to go out, and slaughter, and poison the natives, and say it was smallpox because anytime you put formaldehyde or some kind of poison that's non-detectable in their water system, they'll get either a chicken pox or a smallpox type symptom.\n\n \r\nAnd then they just say, \"Oh these people died of smallpox\", but it was poisoning.\n\n They've been doing that ever since Caesar was around.\n\n Poisoning their enemies.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow did they catch chickenpox kindergarten.\n\n Everybody seems to catch it in the classroom?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, everybody all over the world gets chicken pox, that's a detoxification is nervous system at a young age.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut it's really not contagious thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEverybody detoxes at a certain time?\n\n It's like when the bears come out of hibernation, do you say they're contagious.\n\n Because they come out of hibernation in the United States, and then a few degrees north in Canada, then they start waking up and then up higher in Canada, and Alaska, they all wake up?\n\n So, is that contagious.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSounded like it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSounds like it, but that's the same thing with the Smallpox, and all that.\n\n \r\nThe body, during a certain climate temperature change, and humidity will detox certain tissue, and it's common among a lot of people at the same time.\n\n  \r\nJust like teenagers with acne.\n\n You don't call that contagious, but boy, let me tell you, they'll probably call it contagious.\n\n \r\nSome scientists that have been paid by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n I'll bet you in the next five years comes up with a virus that he says is contagious among teenagers with acne, and we've got a medication for it.\n\n \r\nThat should happen.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Sprouting & Phytic Acid \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are three enzymes that react just like the phytic acid\n\n \r\nSo, even if you sprout it, you still got enzyme inhibitors in it.\n\n Not only that in the sprout you have three, instead of one.\n\n When a seed starts sprouting, it's then a vegetable, we don't handle vegetation.\n\n\r\nWe don't break cellulose down properly.\n\n We don't have that kind of a digestive tract.\n\n \r\nThat's why I say stay away from whole vegetables, unless you've got a bowel condition or a small intestine condition that's too over acidic, and for a while you need  whole vegetables in a salad, but normally it's not.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Trichinosis \n \n \n \n \n### (46) Trouble Sleeping & Brain Detox \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n I have trouble sleeping because my nose gets clogged up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou need to cut down on cream, increase your butter, and sleep at an angle.\n\n  \r\nEat more butter like the lubrication formula, and sleep at an angle.\n\n  \r\nSo, your head is high.\n\n \r\nYou have to understand that when your brain dumps, it dumps most of the poisons out your gums, tongue, and sinus cavity.\n\n \r\nYour brain and nervous system hold the most metals of anywhere in the body.\n\n That's why Alzheimer's is a problem.\n\n  \r\nBecause the body uses metallic minerals in the brain, and nervous system to transmit light, which is information for the nervous system.\n\n So, anytime you eat anything, and it has any kind of metallic mineral in it, which all foods do, the cooking causes it to be free radical.\n\n \r\nSo, you have your greatest concentration of free radicals in the brain, and nervous system.\n\n So, when that dumps, the brain has- usually the tonsils take care of it.\n\n  \r\nThe sinuses, and the gums take care of most of the free radicals.\n\n That's why so much dental decay, the heavy metals come out.\n\n They surrounded the dentine, starts ripping the neurons out of your cells, i complicates the molecular structure, the structure of the teeth, and then you have degeneration.\n\n  \r\nSo, keeping the mouth rinsed is important when you're dumping those metals out of your teeth.\n\n \r\nBrushing your teeth isn't the greatest idea.\n\n \r\nA water pick is the best thing to use to help rebuild those minerals.\n\n  \r\nBecause if you're brushing mercury that's dumping from the brain, it will cause the teeth to abraise, and you'll bruise the dentine more, and you'll have teeth decay.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Urine In Meat, Grain Fed Meat \n \n**[2005],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou bite it and eat it\n\n Like James, the beef, he doesn't have that urine taste.\n\n You know, like the muscle meat won't have that urine taste.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI can always taste.\n\n It taste it in every meat I eat.\n\n  \r\nI'm very sensitive now, I can taste it in everything.\n\n Grain fed animals don't have as high because they have more starch to bind with the ammonia.\n\n  \r\nWhen the animals killed, urine rushes back all through the bloodstream.\n\n It gets into everywhere, and all the meat.\n\n That's why it has a slight ammonia taste that I can detect on any meat except animals that are fed heavy grain.\n\n They have a lot of starch to bind with that ammonia, and it blocks the taste.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs grain fed animals better than grass fed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, but I like some grain fed?\n\n \r\nNow, when you see a cow out in the field, if he's in a field where the grass grows naturally, he won't eat the fresh seeds off of the plant.\n\n  \r\nHe'll eat the green leaves around that doesn't carry the seed, but then you see him go down, and pick off the dried seed right off the top of the dirt.\n\n \r\nHe picks, and eats dried seed, that is normal.\n\n They're grain eating animals, as long as it's dried grain.\n\n So, I think that all animals should be slightly grain fed.\n\n  \r\nWhen they're fed hay, they don't get any- it's always cut.\n\n They cut the alfalfa before it goes to the seed or after they cultivated the seed, so they can plant seed for next year.\n\n The alfalfa is still without seed.\n\n So, they're feeding these animals, grass fed animals that don't get any grain, and that's one of their natural products.\n\n So, I don't agree with this all-grass fed.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Vege Juice, How Much, When \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need to resupply minerals, and enzymes\n\n That's were you get your supplement.\n\n \r\nIn the first book I said you need a minimum 2 cups a day.\n\n Usually before a meat meal is the best time because you get highly acidic afterwards.\n\n\r\nIf you drink the vegetable juice after the meat.\n\n Sometimes it interferes with digestion cause it will rush in quicker, and alkalinize some of the digestive acids\r\nYou won't digest your meat as well.\n\n \r\nSo, that's why I always suggested the vegetable juice an hour before the meat meal.\n\n\r\nThat's the best way to do it.\n\n\r\n I only drank one cup of vegetable juice a day.\n\n\r\nIf I had any more than that.\n\n I started getting sleepy and tired.\n\n It's too much now, but for many years I had to have 2 - 3, or 4 a day.\n\n \r\nThat is just dependent.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you tell how much you need.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet's say you're feeling a little acid, a little bit irritable, a little anxious?\n\n You need more vegetables juice, unless you're eating a lot of fruit, then you need to cut down on the fruit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Virus & Parasites \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nVirus being contagious virus\n\n Virus is not alive.\n\n It's a protein body.\n\n It's a crystalline protein structure that is not alive.\n\n They say that self-replicates itself once it gets inside of the cell, that is a myth.\n\n  \r\nIf something is not alive, it can't self-replicate.\n\n It is an impossibility.\n\n \r\nThat's why if they take a Petri dish that can breed cells with cells, and they can grow in it, and they spike it with virus.\n\n They do not multiply.\n\n Whatever is the amount that you inject into that petri dish is all that's there.\n\n As soon as they put cells in there, then the viruses get inside the cell.\n\n \r\nWhy is that.\n\n \r\nBecause the cells make it to decompose certain kinds of toxic tissue within the structure?\n\n Let's say you have a bad liver, and your body decides to make a solvent of its own to clean the liver, which is hepatitis.\n\n Your body makes hepatitis, there was about 8 varieties of hepatitis, and they say that there's mainly 3, and it's broken down in the sub within those 3.\n\n \r\nBut there's 8 varieties of a virus that is hepatitis oriented, and they can go in and clean out your liver.\n\n Now, the way the medical profession gets you confused is they say, that is what will kill you.\n\n  \r\nThat is the cure for the disease.\n\n The disease is a degenerative liver.\n\n The only way a liver can become degenerative is if you have poisons collect in it.\n\n \r\nAnd when you eat cooked foods, as I explained in the recipe book, I named 33 compounds just from cooking foods that are toxins, that store in the body.\n\n And if they collect over a lifetime, they create serious diseases.\n\n If the placenta hasn't filtered out the toxins from the mother, a baby will be born with diseases.\n\n \r\nTake, for example, I had a girl who was 28 years who came to me with breast cancer, hip cancer and kidney cancer, which was attached to the adrenal gland.\n\n Her breasts hung down to here.\n\n So, she always to go around like this, every time you saw her, she was always hiding that right breast.\n\n 28 years old, only able to work six hours a week.\n\n \r\nThat's how fatigued she was, and this started at 14 years old.\n\n The doctor said all her tests were perfect.\n\n She was in perfect health.\n\n She was as skinny as a rail, very unhealthy, very unhappy.\n\n Everything made her unhappy.\n\n Her eyes were black.\n\n Her mother had blue eyes.\n\n Her father had green eyes, two sisters, the oldest sister had green eyes, the younger had blue.\n\n \r\nWhy did she have black eyes.\n\n So, she went on the diet, five years after she was on the diet, she was able to work 40 hours a week, just normal?\n\n Now seven years later, she works on a farm 14 - 16 hours a day.\n\n Goes surfing, does all kinds of things, changed her life.\n\n Her eyes went from black to blue and orange and they'll be blue.\n\n \r\nJust like mine became blue from dark brown as I got healthier.\n\n It took me 32 years, but I only have one faint brown spot left, in the next probably five years, they will be gone, and that's in my prostate.\n\n Um, don't have any problems with my prostate, but that is an area in my eyes that shows the toxicity is still stored.\n\n \r\nSo, back to the point, the toxicity from whatever you eat, breathe and drink stores in your body, that creates degeneration in the cells.\n\n Virus, bacteria, and parasites are there to eat up the degenerative tissue.\n\n But they say, well, if you have a virus that enters the cell or the cell manufacturers a virus, it has an RNA in it that supplants itself within the DNA.\n\n \r\nAnd then it will form more virus.\n\n I said, that's the point.\n\n But the RNA that the cell puts in that virus is to address only certain tissue.\n\n That's like saying, okay, you're a virus that will be for the certain type of degenerative liver tissue.\n\n So, this will be just a very refined hepatitis virus that will help break down those parts of the liver cells that are damaged and get rid of them.\n\n \r\nThen if you're eating properly, you'll be able to rebuild, but most people don't eat properly, and constantly ingest the poisons.\n\n So, that's how disease develops.\n\n Just remember that bacteria, parasites, and virus are not your enemies.\n\n Those are the cures for the disease.\n\n The disease is the poisoning.\n\n The reason people are getting so many more diseases, and 1/3 women gets cancer, 1/2 men gets cancer nowadays.\n\n  \r\nSo, you gotta understand, why is that.\n\n It's because all of the?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Benefits Of Algae \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat's the benefit of the algae for the body or do you just like the way it feels\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOn the outside it helps give nutrients and pull metals out of the body?\n\n Algae eats rock, it feeds on rock.\n\n It eats metals.\n\n That's why people take algae as a supplement, but dry, not gonna do you much good.\n\n\r\nSo, you soak it for a while and then you have it with maybe a quarter to a half a teaspoon a day with some vegetable juice.\n\n If you have a cancer condition, you can have a teaspoon a day, but break it up into two, half and half.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Blaoting Is Good \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBloated is good\n\n Look at children, babies.\n\n They're all puffed out in the stomach cause they have to digest a lot of food at one time and then provide it to stretch it out to the rest of the body to grow.\n\n If you want to gain weight, that's when you have to get a big stomach, and you have to let that bloating go on for a while.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about rampant diarrhea.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, then you shouldn't be drinking it cold?\n\n Are you drinking it cold.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then you better make kefir.\n\n I have that once in a while, I can't drink any fresh milk.\n\n I have to let it get thick into kefir, but that's rare anymore.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Bone Growth Formula \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDoes everybody know what the bone growth hormone extender is\n\n\r\nLike I say in the book, it's to help heal and regenerate bones?\n\n\r\nPineapple helps, I don't know if you ever seen it under a microscope, bones have like a web system that grows out and then it fills in, and pineapple for some reason stimulates this.\n\n I had  a cup of pineapple every day when I broke this leg cause I mean, I split that tibia in two, and it was separated in the back and they wanted to go and push it back together and pin it.\n\n \r\nPlus the top of the tibia looks like this, and the top of the bottom of the femur sits on it like this.\n\n I broke off the top of the tibia and it jammed up in the femur.\n\n They said that there's no way that the body can dissolve that and get rid of it that they'd have to go in surgically, cut me from here to here, open up the leg and do all this surgery.\n\n\r\nAnd I said, shit, if I do that, it's gonna take me 5, 7 years to heal just from your surgery.\n\n I can eat pineapple.\n\n\r\nThey thought this guy's crazy.\n\n I said, listen, if I can't walk in six weeks, I'll be back for your services.\n\n I was walking without crutches in six and a half weeks.\n\n So it works.\n\n So, pineapple, cheese and honey together, any of those things.\n\n\r\nCheese and honey together in the mouth helps digest all the minerals and the fat and the proteins in the cheese.\n\n Cheese when it's raw will not digest, the body will always use it in every lab test I've done with any kind of animal, giving them raw cheese.\n\n It passes out the feces with toxins attached to it, which is good.\n\n That's what we want.\n\n\r\nIf you're eating cooked cheese, pasteurized cheese.\n\n It's all fractionated anyway.\n\n So, it  attaches to poisons and stays in your body, instead of coming out.\n\n Now to get the cheese to digest, I racked my brain and it was very easy.\n\n Honey's a digestive enzyme, mainly digested enzyme.\n\n Cause when the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows the nectar, predigest it, creates insulin-like substances, which convert the sugars, the carbohydrates into enzyme structures to digest mainly protein and fats.\n\n So, when you're eating honey that's unheated above 93 degrees.\n\n That's not heated about 93 degrees, it has all of those insulin-like substances available for digesting whatever foods you're mixing with it.\n\n If you lack good digestive enzymes, bacteria, or the acids in your stomach, honey will help any kind of digestion.\n\n \r\nI've tried the honey, eating it after the cheese, before the cheese and still it comes out in the feces.\n\n When you mix the cheese together in your mouth or mix it together, mash it together, or make it into a cheesecake fill where the honey is directly mixed into the cheese, it digests.\n\n So, that's where you get your mineral supplement.\n\n That's where you get your highest calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium.\n\n All that to strengthen and take care of the bones.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Cow Share Vs Lease \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey have those contracts set up now\n\n Sally Fallon had a good idea, but it doesn't hold up in court all the time.\n\n She has a cow share agreement.\n\n That means if a judge takes you into court and said, \"How much is the cow you own.\n\n Do you own the ear?\n\n Do you own the leg ,who owns the udders?\n\n\"\r\nThe milk belongs to the udders, see a judge can pull crap like that?\n\n So, having a cow share program has been outlawed in several states and it's been rejected in courts.\n\n A lease, you can lease anything.\n\n You can lease a fingernail, you can lease a person, a home, a chair, a plate, you can lease anything in our country.\n\n\r\nIf they shot down one lease, all the others could tumble.\n\n So, they don't touch leases.\n\n It's a sure fact wire away method of ownership and the leasee is the owner of that property, as long as the lease contract is in force.\n\n**[Didn't write the rest because I felt it wasn't important, might delete that part of audio later]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Diet For People With Colds and Flus \n \n**[2008],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRegarding the diet you put people on who are sick from colds and flus, does that include eating anything else on the regular routine\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n In the recipe book, on page 146 I have a regime that I suggest for people who have colds and flus, and that's mainly milkshakes and one smoothie a day; a smoothie is a milkshake with fruit in it.\n\n\r\nSo, in there I suggest orange, maybe a little banana, you got soreness throughout the body in the muscles or wherever the high potassium in the banana will remove that.\n\n \r\nIt will be a slow process cause banana is one of the hardest foods to digest, longest fruits to digest, so that is a good, slow time release one, as long as it's not too ripe, as long as it's not really ripe at all, it should behalf yellow, half green at the most.\n\n rightness.\n\n \r\nIf you feel fine, eat meat eat anything you want.\n\n That's just for people who are really overwhelmed with the cold or flu.\n\n Just remember a lot of people say, well, I don't want to eat the dairy, it creates mucus.\n\n \r\nWhat the hell do you think a cold and a flu are.\n\n They are detoxification through your mucus membranes?\n\n You have diarrhea involved in it, the mucus binds with those poisons that are coming with those mucus membranes.\n\n It holds onto the poisons, then you want good mucus.\n\n You want lots of it to hold this poisons, because if it doesn't, what's it gonna do.\n\n It's gonna create more vomit and more diarrhea?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Eating Pancreas, Honey \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe pancreas does have a lot of hormones to pull out nutrients out of your body, doesn't necessarily mean that the pancreas is providing you some nutrients to do that\n\n It's just providing you with its own hormones that it uses to attract and recombine enzymes for enzymatic activity for us.\n\n\r\nSo, when you take in an enzyme of a food, your body has to realign it.\n\n It has to fractionate it and then have to realign it for the cellular structure of the human body.\n\n The pancreas was responsible for that, mainly responsible for that.\n\n And if you're eating cooked foods, the pancreas is responsible to form hormones that leach it from the rest of the body to provide it and of course that just spends your bank account.\n\n \r\nIf you have that reaction, it's best to wean yourself off of the pancreas if you don't want to eat the pancreas all the time, then eat more honey.\n\n More honey with your meat meals, honey with butter.\n\n Cause right now your body's not having to work so hard cuz it's got all the enzymes already fractionating and, and recombining nutrients.\n\n\r\nSo, your body hasn't had to do anything with it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Eggs For Digestion \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOn your diet I was eating a pound of meat a day or more, and I'd eat the meet, and I would feel my stomach like wrap around it and in an hour and a half I could eat another meal\n\n It would digest really solid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou were so hungry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow you're not so hungry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n I know.\n\n Well, now when I eat meat, it'll just sit there for like 4 hours and I can feel it it won't go down and digest it.\n\n Anything, even like with milk and like cheese and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat did I just say.\n\n You have a problem like that, you need eggs all day long for days until it stops, until you're rebalanced?\n\n Remember, eggs only takes 23 minutes to digest, so you get to utilize all those proteins and fats to heal and cleanse the body, so you don't have to worry about digestion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, just eat a little at a time.\n\n Eat like a half a cup with some butter or cheese and then maybe twice a day, once a day, and the rest of it do eggs and just a little bit of dairy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd in general, I am not really craving any food.\n\n Like I don't really enjoy the food as much anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAgain, you're not digesting right now.\n\n You must be dumping some toxins in and out of the pancreas and your intestines.\n\n It's a cycle.\n\n I've gone one time, and I wrote in my book that I went 16 months doing that, eating eggs and dairy only because I couldn't eat the meat, I couldn't digest the meat.\n\n It cause bloating and problems.\n\n One time I couldn't eat anything, but chicken for six months, and I talked about that in the book.\n\n You have to go with what your body needs.\n\n\r\nIf you have a digestive problem, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, cuz it doesn't take much to digest them.\n\n Your body can spend energy and those nutrients on cleansing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Eggs For Digestion and Coco Cream and Honey For Dry Mouth \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDoesn't have really muscles and that I noticed with his father that he was very athletic when he was young and I'm surprised that he didn't have it because you can compare with the same roots\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Well, he stopped digesting his proteins, which digest his fat.\n\n Lots of eggs.\n\n Eggs, eggs, eggs.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou said you could eat the eggs with a meal to gain weight, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but sometimes when you can't digest, you have to just eat a lot of eggs by themselves?\n\n Like I say, for me, maybe 22 eggs a day, I lose weight.\n\n If I eat 24 a day, I don't lose weight, but I force my body to heal and to cleanse and heal rapidly and only focus on that, so then I can go back to eating meat and I can digest it.\n\n So, when you have a situation like that, he needs to eat as much eggs, so he doesn't lose weight, maybe even gains a little bit if he eats enough of them till he can digest his meats properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you just eat the eggs.\n\n Nothing else?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUsually when you're having eggs, you're gonna get very dry, the body starts using a tremendous amount of H20 with it?\n\n So, you may need to just sip on like a tablespoon of milk every 20 minutes, just to keep hydrated and coconut cream on the lips.\n\n Little bit of honey with coconut cream on the lips and on the tongue, just to keep moisturized.\n\n \r\nAnd remember it's not mainly the H2O that causes dry mouth.\n\n The poisons leave the brain out the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands just pulls all the fats in the face.\n\n That's why all people who eat cooked foods get wrinkled in the face before they wrinkle anywhere else, because all the fats are being pulled out of the face to bind with all the metals that are in the brain.\n\n\r\nRemember the brain is 60% fat, and where do mainly toxins store.\n\n In the fat?\n\n And if they're thin people, they only have two places to store it.\n\n The brain and the bone marrow.\n\n \r\nSo, when those poisons dump out, it rips all the fat out of the face.\n\n So, people get dry mouth.\n\n You need to put the coconut cream with honey on those lips, cuz the coconut cream will absorb quicker into the tissue more than anything else.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Eggs Two Days A Week For Weight Loss \n \n**[2008],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou told me to do eggs two days a week\n\n Can I drink anything with those eggs or eat any fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you do, you're not going to go on your weight loss?\n\n It's not gonna cause weight loss.\n\n Remember eggs eaten with other foods causes weight gain, eggs eaten alone causes weight loss.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n The reason I ask is cuz, and I've even put the coconut cream on my lips, but I get so incredibly thirsty has, not so bad now, but in the summer, but finally when I drank the milk with cream and honey, I would drink that, and then I would Polish two quarts of milk after that cause I just had to drink something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're drinking it too fast.\n\n You have to sip it.\n\n And if you get thirsty like that, just take a tablespoon of milk at time.\n\n Every hour if you want do that.\n\n Tablespoon of milk at a time.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nCan I do vegetable juices throughout the day too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you can do vegetable juices when you're doing eggs?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nLots of it if I get really thirsty.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I would say no more than a quart a day?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMight demineralize the body.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nBut not eating fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNever?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nNot even tomatoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTomatoes?\n\n Yeah.\n\n Bland fruit is okay.\n\n You can eat cucumber peeled.\n\n\r\nIt's either in We Want To Live or the Recipe Book and it's that athletes mixture hydrolyzer of cucumber, about two cups of cucumber, one cup of tomato juice, a little bit of lemon juice, lots of honey and cream, a little coconut cream and blend that all together.\n\n And you can sip on that, but just leave out some of that cream, don't put as much in.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nNow, was the purpose of the eggs to lose weight or was it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe purpose of the eggs is to burn off excess fat, so you put new fat on the body?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nCause I thought it was because of my weak digestive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat too.\n\n Your intestines weren't healing like I wanted them to do, as quickly.\n\n So, I thought if we take off the weight and you put on good fats, your body's gonna be able to clean the intestines faster.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Egsg Easy To Dgiest, 25-50 To Not Lose Weight \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo, not weight gain, that's weight loss\n\n I have some people eat only eggs because they don't digest.\n\n So, when you eat an egg, an egg is the easiest food in the world to digest, takes 23 minutes to digest an egg.\n\n Only three inches of your small intestine is utilized to digest and absorb that egg.\n\n That means your body gets all this intensely small easily digested, liquid fat and protein.\n\n It goes right in the system to heal, cleanse, and heal the body.\n\n \r\nSo, if you've got a bad digestive tract, you need lots and lots of eggs.\n\n Not enough to lose weight, so you have to eat 25 - 50 a day, so you don't lose weight for somebody your size.\n\n I've eaten up to 50 a day.\n\n\r\nIf I eat let's say, only eggs all day long, 25 and I won't lose weight.\n\n If I eat 22, I'll still lose a little weight.\n\n So, I just have to find my level when I'm just doing an all egg and when I do an all egg diet it's because something is dumping into my intestines, poisoning the bacterial environment in there, so they are not digesting food particles anymore.\n\n \r\nSo, I need to eat things that don't require much bacteria and that's the egg, the egg's the only one.\n\n It takes milk a minimum of 6 hours to digest, and that's if it's kefir.\n\n \r\nIf it is whole milk, then you're looking at 19-20 hours to digest, even 24 hours to digest.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Fogginess, Nausea, Duming Poisons \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nStill, it's kind of plateaued\n\n It comes in waves every three weeks or so.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust remember, whenever you get nauseous, you're dumping poisons from the stomach walls and esophagus into the stomach.\n\n You get nauseous from that.\n\n That's an indication to eat cheese, I don't care if it's just a little sugar cube sized amount, which is about half of  a teaspoon of cheese.\n\n That may be all it takes, but if it's dumping every few minutes, just keeps dumping.\n\n You may have to eat a sugar cube size of cheese, every 10 to 20 minutes, until the nausea is relieved.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Good Vs Bad Fat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why, even if it's bad fat, people who have bad fat are still healthier than people who are skinny, because those fats bind with poisons\n\n So, I like people who are this weight right here, because she's well protected.\n\n I like somebody who has weight like this because of they're well protected, unless they get so old with toxins and it starts breaking down their body.\n\n\r\nThe fat that they maintain isn't good quality enough.\n\n If you have that much fat on this diet, you shouldn't have to worry about any kind of imposition in the system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Gorillas Eat Green Bananas \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey don't do it every day\n\n No, nobody advertises this stuff and the gorillas, man, they're laid back.\n\n They roll around, pick each other.\n\n They have a good life.\n\n Roll around with each other and groom each other and eat green bananas.\n\n They don't eat any ripe fruit.\n\n Have you ever tried eating a green banana.\n\n They eat the rind with it with the peel on it?\n\n\r\nCan't get enough enzymes to have all this digestive juice and fluid, which digest it great.\n\n There's no high sugar in it, lots of enzymes though.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I read in your book you mentioned to eat unripe pineapple, banana.\n\n It didn't sound very appetizing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnce you make the change, it may be a big difference.\n\n\r\nYou'll have less depression.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause it's fermented, is that why.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it ferments in the body, but the high sugar cause stickiness in the brain and nervous system fluid?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when it's unripe, there's less.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSugar and fermentation?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Gout and Animal Vs Plant Protein \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nPancreas, more honey, and cut it down\n\n \r\nDo you have a question, Jim.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Uh, if gout comes from inability to process uric acid and uric acid comes from poorly digest protein, is animal protein any different than vegetable protein.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you have vegetable protein, you're only gonna have vegetable fats accompanying it?\n\n\r\nAgain, you're also gonna have a high amount of alkalinity, not something that the body utilizes properly.\n\n So, it'll take you twice as long to heal with that kind of mixture.\n\n\r\n And also, vegetable oils in the human body, remember herbivores, animals that eat vegetation have a body temperature of 101° to 105° all the time.\n\n If they go into a fever, it can get up to 107°, 108°, sometimes 110°.\n\n \r\nOurs can go up to 106.\n\n8°.\n\n That's the highest I've ever seen, and on this diet, no brain damage, even if it goes that high.\n\n Just eat some tomatoes and the vitamin a and all of the acids in it will bring the temperature down anyway.\n\n Not that you want it, but if people start panicking, that's what I suggest in the book for if they panic from fever.\n\n \r\nSo, the herbivore has a very high body temperature.\n\n So, it handles the vegetable oils very well, keeps them fluid.\n\n At the human body, normal temperature is 98.\n\n6herbivores and lower.\n\n Vegetable oils, if we use vegetable oils in our cells to structure the cell, it will have a tendency to crystallize.\n\n\r\nThat's what causes hardening of the arteries and heart, not animal fats.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Goverment Doesntt Want People To Be Healthy \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWho started this against the milk industry\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe health department?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey just want to try to deprive us from as much nutritional food as possible because it's big business.\n\n Disease is big business.\n\n You know, doctors and pharmaceuticals.\n\n It's like, keep the nutrition with everyone very, very low, so none of our brains can grow and get stronger and get more intuitive on what's really right for us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThis stuff made me from, I was autistic.\n\n I was 22 when I started drinking the raw carrot juice and raw milk.\n\n Within about 10 days of drinking those, all of a sudden my autism- I was able to read, I was able to comprehend language for the first time in 21.\n\n5 years.\n\n\r\nOf course they don't have you to have raw milk, they don't want good mind.\n\n They want people sick and subservient.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike little dummies, following the sheep.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLook at our educational system.\n\n If you look at who created the educational system, mainly the Rockefellers and the Rockefellers are known to want to run the world, rule the world and they have ways and all kinds of ideas on how the educational system should be set up to make us dumb.\n\n And there's a few books on it and how the Rockefeller wrote the whole didactic approach to our educational system in America.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Heart Palpitations Fro Mvege Juice \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay\n\n Whenever you have heart palpitations, or pounding hearts after a vegetable juice, you have to whip an egg into it.\n\n What was happening is the enzymes that you're getting in the vegetable juice, and I put a little cilantro in it.\n\n It's pulling out heavy metals.\n\n\r\nThe heart does not want to allow those heavy metals to lock into the tissue of the heart or any other gland.\n\n So, it sends the blood more racing through the body.\n\n So, the blood passes to the intestinal tracts more often, and that poison will hopefully dump into the intestinal tract and not the heart, brain or one of the glands.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do you mean whipped.\n\n Do you just stir it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust whip it?\n\n No, don't blend it.\n\n Just whip it right before you drink it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWith a spoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWith a spoon or a fork?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you add the cream to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if the cream is not doing it, it's the protein you're missing in it, so you have to add the egg?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you do the three together.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't put the three?\n\n If you're using cream, you stop using the cream and you use the egg.\n\n Egg has plenty of fat, so you don't need the cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Eggs and I, we don't have a real compassion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know.\n\n But you have to, you have to get acclimated to it.\n\n Have you ever broken an egg for baking a cake.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Well use half of it, get one those little one ounce jars at the Rawsome club.\n\n Just take out half of the egg white and half of the egg yolk, and put em, one of those one or two ounce jars and save it for the next time, and use half of it in that vegetable juice, you should be able to be okay.\n\n\r\nAnd I'd like you to work up to an egg at a time if you're having heart palpitations.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) High Ketones Not Kidney Problem \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLet's let's just take a look at this test\n\n This is gonna show you how ridiculous tests are.\n\n You have to understand that the pharmaceutical industry is made sure that they've created tests that convince you to take drugs, to take medical therapy.\n\n Now, if you've got a high ketone level in your blood, they automatically say you've got a kidney problem.\n\n\r\n90% of the people who have high ketones don't have a kidney problem.\n\n But they want you to think you have a kidney problem, so you start taking medication and treating for a kidney problem.\n\n And guess what.\n\n The medication from the kidney problem usually will create a kidney problem?\n\n So, you say, \"Yeah, they were right.\n\n I got kidney problem\".\n\n\r\nSo, you have to be very careful.\n\n I don't accept not one of their tests.\n\n Not one of them, because look what they're doing.\n\n They're taking a shot of your blood, a photograph of your blood for one moment in your life, and they're basing all of this stuff about your health on a blood test.\n\n \"Oh, well, it's gotta be this chemistry and this valve\", everybody is so different.\n\n\r\nSo, all of these tests are ridiculous.\n\n I'm talking about blood tests, chemical analysis.\n\n You go to the colonoscopy and you go up there and see cancer.\n\n What do they want to do.\n\n Surgeries, chemo, radiation, this doesn't nurture the body?\n\n This destroys the body more.\n\n It'll make you sicker in the long run.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) High Meat and Kefir \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, in the human body, at least those are broken down way in advance of going into your system\n\n So, your bacteria in your intestines can break that down and feed on that bacteria.\n\n And then when it gets to the colon, E coli can do it easily and take care of you.\n\n Even if you don't have good colonies of it, it's already so reduced that when they get a hold of it, it can produce it pretty easily, but it's still the meat has protein concentrations like tryptophan that are not high in milk, they're high in meats.\n\n\r\nAnd tryptophan is good for relaxing, for sleeping, for things like.\n\n \r\nSo, that is still not quite the value that high meat can give you, but it can still take care of a lot of the psychological problems and anything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's almost instantaneous.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWithin 10 to 20 minutes, I've only had one person that didn't react and he wasn't that depressed anyways?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) How Long Bloating Lasts \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUsually it's there all day long\n\n It usually takes somewhere around, depending upon how severe somebody's digestive system is.\n\n I've had people deal with the bloating for about if they never had a child, they can get over maybe year, year, and a half.\n\n\r\nThey don't have to experience regular constant bloating.\n\n If they've had a child, then it could last 3 years.\n\n If they've had a cesarean, could last 6 years.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) How To Regenerate Heart \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust general heart re-stimulation, generation, circulation, build up\n\n What food formulas.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you want to really build a heart you eat heart: chicken heart, buffalo heart, and you have heart every week at Rawsome, and that's the best thing for the heart?\n\n\r\nAny kind of red meat is good for the heart, especially with tomatoes.\n\n Sometimes the peel isn't as good.\n\n So you might want to peel the tomato cuz it can interfere with digestion for a lot of people, especially over the age of 40, 45.\n\n So, if you're having tomato with meat, would be best not to eat the peel on the tomato.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Illegal Raw Milk \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut he was just asking how many states can have the raw milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, there's only 15 states that actually outlawed outright.\n\n Most of the states where you can get it it's not available in stores, except in Connecticut and California.\n\n Otherwise, you can buy it at the farm.\n\n\r\nSo, that's the only way you can get it is buy it at the farm or have somebody who gets it from the farmer and distributes it.\n\n Now, that's what I created all over the United States is like we have the Rawsome club here.\n\n We've got branches of the Rawsome all over, just spelled differently.\n\n This Rawesome has an E after the R A W E S O M E, the other Rawsome clubs throughout the United States or R A W S O M E.\n\n\r\nAnd what I do is we lease the herds or chickens or with flocks, whatever it is, the club leases the herd or flocks, whatever it is for milk or meat, the co-op the awesome club leases it so that they own the herd.\n\n They own all the product.\n\n So, the farmer works, for us by taking care of the cows, feeding the cows, housing them and, milking, bottling the milk and delivering it to wherever we need to deliver it or pick it up from them.\n\n\r\nSo, we pay them per bottle or per pound, whatever it is, whether it's meat or eggs or, dairy.\n\n We pay them per bottle for handling all that.\n\n So, that is a surefire way to- the Pennsylvania tried to- was the first one with the FDA who tried to shoot that down in court, and I wrote the legal documents for it.\n\n 67 page one and a 19 page one because  they were going into court on the same day, these two farmers.\n\n So, I had my milk report attached, so that took up 53 pages of the 72 pages, and the rest was a declaration that we are not commercial.\n\n The FDA, the Health Department has jurisdiction over commercial dairy only.\n\n This is not commercial.\n\n This is private enterprise.\n\n \r\nThis club's members owned the dairy, they're not buying it.\n\n So, we can ship it across any state line we want, we can do anything with it.\n\n, we don't have to label our milk.\n\n We put it on the contracts, each member has to sign a contract that says we want bacteria like E coli, salmonella, trichinosis, if you signed the Rawsome club, you've read what I wrote.\n\n\r\nSo, it completely takes you out of any jurisdiction that they can have.\n\n LA county came after Rawsome here to close them down, James and everybody just freaked out because they were intimidating.\n\n So, I called the health department and I said, \"Listen, your guy trespassed.\n\n It says, no trespassing, except for members, your guy trespassed.\n\n He broke the law.\n\n We will not press charges, but you're gonna have to leave us alone because we are not commercial, we are private.\n\n You have jurisdiction over commerciality only.\n\n We don't wanna see you again.\n\n Thank you very much\".\n\n That was the end of it.\n\n They haven't bugged us in three years.\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I sent them a copy of the lease agreements that we have with our farmers that show that we own the milk and then the club member's agreement showing that we want everything out of the counties and states in federal regulation, because you're only allowed to have so much bacteria.\n\n We say we want all we can get.\n\n So, we don't want any kind of antiseptics, no Clorox, no bleach, no nothing near our food.\n\n We want bacteria.\n\n So, with that kind of a representation, they took it to their attorneys and they got back to me a week later and said, \"kay, you're right:.\n\n We have no jurisdiction\".\n\n And that was that.\n\n\r\nAnd when we took it to the court, now I didn't even go with the farmers cuz I just wrote out the documents for them pro pre.\n\n So, they took their documents in there, and the judge said, \"You sure you want to find this against you\".\n\n\r\nAnd the health department said, \"No, we don't\"?\n\n So they just dropped it.\n\n They dropped the charges for selling milk without certification and without permits.\n\n And I said, \"We don't need permits.\n\n We're not selling it for the public\".\n\n So, all my farmers that we contract with for all the different clubs, most of that dairy comes from Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania is supply even to my clubs in Florida.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Iridology and Consult \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have to experiment individually, like on how much meat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight?\n\n And how much is proper for your system.\n\n Now, if I were to do a consult with you and I can see your colon, I can tell you the likelihood of how much you would need and how long it would take your intestines to be clean enough to foster and nurture the E.\n\n coli on your own.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat was actually not my question.\n\n When you do your individual consultation, do you conduct different tests like blood work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I do neurology, and then I check the glandular activity and the blood and everything on the hand?\n\n Similar to the Chinese method, but I have a developed my own because the degree Chinese method was built on the Ayurvedic system, which is prejudice toward yin and yang.\n\n\r\nIt's too narrow of an arena to be able to distinguish what I need to distinguish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCause you mentioned looking at the colon, how would you do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's in the Iris?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Kids Going Itn Odeperession After Vaccine \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're taking medication, you've had a vaccine, of course you're intestinal environment, your E\n\n coli is gonna be destroyed for quite a while.\n\n Why do you think a lot of children go into depression for a year after a vaccine, after a round of vaccine.\n\n They get more irritable, look at the kids nowadays in their teens\r\nIn New Jersey they get 128 vaccines by the time they're 15?\n\n5 and California it's 102 by the time you're 15.\n\n5 if you don't sign that waiver on the back, and you wonder why these kids are depressed and anxiety, and they're never satisfied, they don't want you satisfied.\n\n\r\nThey want you consuming.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Leonardo Drank Raw Milk \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n I'm also trying to get Leonardo Dicaprio\n\n Now Martin Sheen and Leonardo worked on The Departed film that was released last year, and it won all those awards.\n\n So, Martin's gonna call Leonardo and Leonardo was raised on raw milk cuz he was a patient of Paul Fleiss who is a pediatrician.\n\n\r\nSo, it looks like everything's going very well, but I don't know if we're gonna be able to get ahold of Leonard cause he's probably one of the busiest actors there is.\n\n \r\nBecause of raw milk he's one of the brightest young minds we have.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe did that 11th hour documentary about planetary survival.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, he's a very conscious young man.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Ligaments Can Grow Back \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou cut your ligament\n\n What makes you think it wasn't gonna grow back.\n\n\r\nWhy do they have to sew that?\n\n It would grow back?\n\n If you're on this diet, it'll grow back.\n\n I ripped the tendons from here, you got a rope of them here and here just last March 5th.\n\n I ripped this one down here and this one up here.\n\n\r\nCompletely ripped them, ripped them off the bone, and they were bubbled up here in, and within a week they had grown back and attached.\n\n I still had a slight bit of pain there and I split the Tibia in two, and they said I would never walk again.\n\n I'd never be able to stand again, unless I had surgery.\n\n\r\nAnd I didn't have any surgery.\n\n Leg doesn't stretch all the way completely yet, straighten, but still.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Lube Formula, Dont Hadd Too Much Coconut Cream \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you gave me the diet, you said any of the foods that you told me to eat, I could eat more if I wanted to, but specifically on the moisturizing/lubricating formula\n\n If you like it with more coconut cream, can you add more or should you keep it the way that you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou do not want to add more coconut treatment than I suggest because then you're gonna detox more, you're gonna go into diarrhea, you're gonna have a lot of other problems?\n\n Coconut cream is mainly for cleansing the body.\n\n Any kind of fruit or vegetable oil is cleansing, 90% cleansing.\n\n So, no, you could add other fats.\n\n You could add dairy cream to it, you could add more eggs, more honey.\n\n Fine.\n\n Just not more coconut cream.\n\n\r\nI always push everybody's limits with the coconut cream.\n\n So, please don't add more than I've suggested.\n\n That's the one thing I asked you not to change.\n\n You could have less, but not more.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about washing with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWashing, you can wash as much, as often as you like, that doesn't bother?\n\n When I'm in Thailand, it cost $8 an hour for massage and it cost me $0.\n\n80 a liter for coconut cream.\n\n So, instead of sleeping a normal 5 hours, like I do 4 to 5 hours.\n\n Sometimes I'll only sleep 3.\n\n5 hours, but I'll go take my naps during my massages.\n\n So, I will have coconut cream massaged in to me sometimes 4 hours a day while I sleep.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Lung Detoxifier \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is a great detoxifier for the lungs\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, one of the best detoxes for anything is coconut cream?\n\n Any fruit along with that, tomatoes and coconut cream are a good combination to clean the lungs, ice cream is wonderful for cleaning the lungs, especially with lime or lemon in it.\n\n \r\nEating raw ice cream.\n\n Raw milk, raw cream ice cream with raw egg in it, especially with lime  and lemon combination.\n\n \r\nThere's a lot of people who have lung problems and as soon as they eat the lemon/ lime or just straight lime ice cream, usually within 10, 20 minutes they're coughing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Meat Without Fat For Weight Loss \n \n**[2008],[Abraham]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor me, like I'm fat, my body like meats and chicken without the fat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCould you eat it without the fats.\n\n**[Abraham]**\n\r\nYeah, without the butter or cream on a daily basis?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that would be fine if you want to lose weight?\n\n That's why I had in the Recipe Book, the weight loss, you had meat without any kind of fat with it, except for a little bit just so you don't dry out completely.\n\n \r\nSo, you eat lots of eggs and, and meat without much fat to pull the fats off of the body if you want to lose weight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Ocean Bathing , Water Dries Skin, Aajons Bath Every 5 Day \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou kinda answered it, but I don't get involved in the water as far as like washing myself and, and I do a lot of work on in the dirt and stuff like that\n\n The ocean, can I bathe in the ocean.\n\n I'm looking at drying out the skin cause I run into that when I'm in like?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're gonna dry out the skin anytime you get in water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAny water at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny water, and of course, salt water is gonna be more dry?\n\n Because salt dries things out.\n\n \r\nCause that water's pretty sticky, so I'm not sure that you'll get very clean.\n\n You won't feel clean, it will clean you.\n\n Cause that salt will break down the fat on your tissue, on your skin and help open a layer up, so that more nutrients can flow through the skin.\n\n And that's okay.\n\n I mean, I've done it when I lived near an ocean and didn't have a lake to go into.\n\n\r\nBut you know, people on this diet don't need to take baths every day.\n\n I take a bath when it's not winter and it's not cold, I take a bath once every days.\n\n When it's winter and I'm cold I get into my hot tub everyday.\n\n But I never use soaps.\n\n I use fermented coconut cream, my old coconut cream is for my bathing.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you have well water out there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I have well water out there, so I don't have to put the milk and all that stuff in there?\n\n I still put coconut cream on my body and then go in.\n\n \r\nAnd after a few months of using, cause I go away for some time, when I'm not working.\n\n But after I do that and have enough coconut cream in there, all of a sudden it comes out when I backwash it, it'll start spraying out this clay cause I use a sand filter.\n\n So, it breaks the coconut cream down into a clay and then feeds my algae.\n\n \r\nThe sand filter keeps the water crystal clear, but it allows algae to grow, and algae's nice and soft.\n\n So, I don't want to destroy the algae, and then when the clay comes out, the clay made from the coconut cream, it helps feed the algae.\n\n It was very strong alga.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Onions and Garlic To Increase Blood Pressure \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo increase his blood pressure\n\n Onions or garlic or both, and it just takes a little bit?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOnion and garlic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTogether or seperately.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can have them together or separately, but it doesn't take a lot?\n\n In fact, having too much can create the opposite effect, can lower it.\n\n Most people take garlic and onion to lower blood pressure when they eat a lot of, but it raises it when you have a little in certain people.\n\n \r\nLike me, if I have a garlic, even a little sliver, I will be horny for days.\n\n It just drives me crazy.\n\n It just raises my blood pressure, raises hormone levels and everything.\n\n So, it depends upon the individual and people who naturally have low blood pressure, that's the way it works.\n\n It works the opposite.\n\n It works to raise it, instead of lowering.\n\n\r\nIt depends upon the person, start off with a sliver.\n\n What I usually do is I'll take a little garlic clove, one out the whole bunch and I'll peel it and then, or curl it and then take a very thin, like a 32nd to a 16th of an inch slice out of the center, and then I'll blend that with a whole cup of butter to make garlic butter, and that is enough to get me going.\n\n \r\nSo, it depends upon the individual.\n\n You could start off with a little amount and raise it if he needs.\n\n Well, it's just when his blood pressures up for him.\n\n\r\n I'm just saying, for me, it raises my blood pressure so high, it also starts the sexual thinking and that's just a small amount.\n\n So, I mean, it used to work, but I was very ill.\n\n I could eat that much and it wouldn't do that, it would raise my blood pressure, but not cause hormones to produce or anything like that.\n\n So, he is not a well individual, so  he may just need that much to get his blood pressure up without exceeding the other function.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Peel Tomatoes \n \n \n \n \n### (32) People Overeating On Cooked Diets \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey don't want you satisfied\n\n They want you consuming, consuming, consuming.\n\n Food doesn't have any nutrition there if it's processed.\n\n You're always going to be hungry and eating and eating and eating, unless you're anorexic, then you can't because you're so nauseous from all the poisons you can't eat, but most people are overeating constantly.\n\n\r\nI know people who eat tons of food and can't gain an ounce of weight every day.\n\n And Jeff slay was that way, soon as he was on the diet five months, you look at him, the pictures on the website, Wewant2live.\n\ncom and you can see the difference between somebody whos fed good, raw nutrition and then processed nutrition.\n\n Whole different thing entirely, so the E.\n\n coli is very important.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Perfume Allergy, Lots Of Fat \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust to counteract the effects of like chemical sensitivity to like colognes and stuff like that, and laundry detergent and working with people like that you're just inhaling it all the time\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGotta have a lot of fat in the body.\n\n He's talking about people who have allergies to colognes and perfumes, how to desensitize yourself to that.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat do you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLot's of fat?\n\n\r\nYou're fine.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nI've heard of those pendants you can put on your neck.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's not really.\n\n So, what it can do is some of those pendants that you can wear that say they clean the air, what they do is they generate ions on.\n\n California, we all know about too many protons goes a long time without raining and everybody gets crazy.\n\n\r\nYou have more road rage, everything increases substantially, psychologically.\n\n People's buttons are pushed very easily, very sensitive at those times.\n\n And then when it rains, the body brings all these ions there, it balances the intensity of protons.\n\n What happens.\n\n People feel better?\n\n So, those things are ionic generators.\n\n\r\nHowever, the problem with that is that when you send out these new ions, guess what happens.\n\n The protons start bombarding anything?\n\n So, you're gonna go into your lungs, into your respiratory system, uh, into your mucus membranes and bombard and cause proton toxicity, so it's going to imbalance your own electrical system.\n\n\r\nSo, that's not the way to do it.\n\n Especially right up against your face and over your, your chest.\n\n Sure, it will work, but the end result is not longevity wise proper.\n\n \r\nI tell people, they say, \"Well, I'm in a very toxic area.\n\n Should I use an ionizer in my house.\n\n\" Sure, use an ionizer in your house, but you put it in a room that you're not in?\n\n \r\nNight, you put it in the living room or the dining room and let it take care of those rooms, and you close your bedroom door and you put a towel down at the bottom.\n\n \r\nAnd then during the day, half an hour before you're going to get up and to move around you set your alarm, you go our there and turn it off.\n\n Hold your breath, keep your eyes squinted, turn it off and then go back.\n\n And most of the protons will be bombarded into your rug and walls and everything.\n\n So, it's not likely to harm you, but just in case, go in there, turn it off, go back to bed for 30 minutes and then get up, take it to the bedroom, close the bedroom after you're dressed and everything and let it do it in the bedroom.\n\n\r\nOr if you want to do it in a perfectly natural way, get 3 plants per room and they'll take care of it for you.\n\n And on the website wewant2live.\n\ncom.\n\n, I wrote three newsletters that I put in there about the plants that are most effective in pulling toxins out of your home.\n\n Either building materials and toxicity that's airborne.\n\n \r\nSo, those plants can help you maintain a very healthy environment, air filter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, ionizers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I say, they are an option and they will help, but they are not the best?\n\n What did I just talk about.\n\n Ionics?\n\n That's a problem.\n\n \r\nYour HEPA filter is okay, they're just gonna run the air that's present in the system through a filter and help pull out the toxins and poisons that are larger particles.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Predigestd Dairy

\n \n \n \n \n### (38) Raw Milk Lobbying \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI guess people got my email this morning that I wrote last night about Ron Paul, all the lobby that  five of us did\n\n \r\nWe'll just have to put up with some of the talking.\n\n Anyway, five of us were in Washington, DC.\n\n I went May 28th and stayed to August 1st.\n\n We lobbied Congress five days a week, had meetings with senators and representatives, 2 to 7 a day.\n\n\r\nThat was very rare that there were 7 a day.\n\n We had meetings with them, convinced them that the raw milk was a safe and good thing.\n\n Out of 537, we only saw 76, would've taken probably a year to see all of.\n\n However, we did have a plan to go to each office with a report that I had printed, just the printing alone was $15,000 and the rental of the unit was 10,000, the house.\n\n \r\nVery expensive to live in DC in a nice neighborhood.\n\n The Cohen family out of Colorado funded the whole thin, so that was very good.\n\n So, when we went to Ron Paul's office, his chief assistant, Norman Singleton said, \"You want a bill.\n\n We'll write a bill for you\"?\n\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I said, \"Sure, let me see how many co-sponsors we can get before you write it\".\n\n So, we had about 70 representatives and senators who agreed to sign on as co-sponsors, if they would get somebody else to write the bill.\n\n Well, Ron Paul was way out there, so I was afraid for him to write the bill, even though he is an MD, he's a doctor, so it'd be perfect to have an MD write it.\n\n\r\nHowever, the stature that he's accumulated in the past few months is incredible.\n\n So, we've been writing the bill for the past for about 6, 7 weeks.\n\n We were tossing the bill back and forth, rewriting it to make it as simple as possible like a one paragraph or less, three sentences is what we were trying to whittle it down to and did the final right of it, and he submitted the bill to Congress on November 5th.\n\n And just last Thursday, Dennis Kuk and Peter Welch signed on as co-sponsors.\n\n So, in the email that I sent this morning, or last during the middle of the night, I asked people who  are pretty savvy about the milk, who understand it can call all these 70 representatives and get them to sign on as co-sponsors, the ones that promised that they would, if they go out somebody to submit a bill.\n\n So, we need people who can get on the phone in this next week and call everybody.\n\n I will be calling some, I've got this other California law that passed, which is going to wipe us out of milk in California.\n\n So, I need people who can call in the next two weeks to get as many to sign on as possible.\n\n\r\nThe federal law allows raw milk to go interstate.\n\n Right now it's outlawed, and the FDA is using that as a reason to say raw milk is bad, but if this law is delivered to Congress by an MD, they're gonna have a hard time using that defense anymore.\n\n\r\nSo, I'm also planning to do a class action suit with them starting somewhere around April, but this class action we're going to against the California legislature is a law that was just signed in by the governor on I think it was October 10th, something like that.\n\n October 8th, somewhere around there.\n\n The governor signed it in that will make the regulations for raw milk for the coliform count so strict that the milk will pass no more than 50% of the time, and that way it'll put the raw dairy producers out of business because they won't be able to afford to stay in business.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n**[unclear]**\n here when the Los Angeles county, the medical milk commission did that very same thing.\n\n \r\nSo, I took it to the legislature, showed them all of the documentation on raw milk that was a good thing, and Vicky Union who was the head of the health department at the time issued a 5 page letter to the board of supervisors stating that it killed children, like one girl, she had really drowned in a lake, it had nothing to do with salmonella.\n\n\r\nSo, I showed that every statement that he put in the letter was false, he was fired a week later.\n\n They have to because they set them up for a suit and I was getting ready to file a suit on them.\n\n So, with him having created all this false information, it was blatant that they were prejudice in creating a situation of fraud to defraud the public of the raw milk.\n\n\r\nSo, of course the bill passed, 4 out of 5.\n\n So, it was close to unanimous, so we got the mill.\n\n So, now we're facing the same thing, the state did it, passed that law.\n\n So, I have to go on with a class action suit.\n\n \r\nI just got an attorney who's going to help, he's not licensed in California, but he's a constitutional attorney out of east, out of Washington state, he's the head professor for constitutional law.\n\n So, he's agreed to do it for half price, 350 an hour, instead of 700 an hour.\n\n So, we need your donations.\n\n I have enough to probably get us all the way through to the court steps with donations already, but if it goes to court, then of course we're gonna need the extra money.\n\n Another 30,000 to get us through the court.\n\n Don't want to do it pro bono, because that means if there is money that we get, it's all gonna go to the attorneys and we'll see $5 a piece, something like that.\n\n And I don't think attorneys deserve it, that kind of money just to go in pro bono.\n\n\r\nThat's like 100% interest on their money.\n\n Not right.\n\n Of course it is a high risk gamble, but everything's a risk when you're investing, whether it's a savings account or whatever, so need your donations to help out there.\n\n Also, I'll be getting another large donation, $25,000 from the Cohen family this February to give $5,000 the right to choose healthy food.\n\n\r\nThat's why we had to wait two years to receive $75,000 before we could go to Washington DC to do that, and that whole episode cost about $40,000 to be in Washington to be in two months.\n\n That was pretty good.\n\n Most lobbyists charge $100,000 a month.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh you to pay them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, we did it ourselves, but all the expenses, which was for 5 of us and all the food, especially for little piggy Nathan, where is he?\n\n The amount of food that guy eats?\n\n\r\nHe's skinny now.\n\n Now he doesn't have all the food we get, but all of us ate well.\n\n And,  Nathan did a lot of work there, he made our food for us.\n\n He wasn't there the whole time, he came about a month later, about four weeks after we were there.\n\n So, he prepared our food for us, even went shopping and did a lot of computer work too.\n\n \r\nSo, we all worked very hard and very long hours, so we've worked very hard to make raw milk available.\n\n And then for them to pull this thing in California state legislature, they slip a one page bill that nobody noticed into the farm bill regulating raw milk and it didn't belong in there.\n\n They snuck it in.\n\n So, of course, Schwarzenegger grew up on raw milk, he trained with raw milk.\n\n So, I'm sure he wouldn't have signed it if he had seen it.\n\n But he's the only one that can issue a letter to the health department and say, back off, you cannot enforce this law and he can do that.\n\n\r\nHe can't resend the law I found out from the constitutional attorney, he can't resend it.\n\n If he was going to resend it, he had to do it within 30 days.\n\n He'd already signed it before anybody found out about it.\n\n It's too late.\n\n Yeah.\n\n He had 30 days to resend it, he didn't do it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe wouldn't have signed that?\n\n He would've had it rejected from the bill, from the farm bill, cause he's for raw milk, unless he's in the hands of big corporations like Enron, cuz he's in the Enron's lap.\n\n And the Bush family, he's heavily in with the Bush family.\n\n So, he may have, I doubt that he knew about it.\n\n I doubt that he would've let that fly.\n\n \r\nSo, I've got an attorney in San Francisco who looks like he will be doing the submitting of the law and briefs and the injunction in the lawsuit itself.\n\n I got Martin, Charlie Sheen, and Emilio Estevez as they will go and do a press release when we file the suit, they will be part of the lawsuit to get us some publicity, cuz all you have to do is make enough noise, and the health department doesn't want to be seen as a bad guy and the government doesn't want to be seen as that big of a bad guy.\n\n \r\nSo, that's why I'm getting them, I'm also trying to get Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\n Now Martin Sheen and Leonardo worked on The Departed film that was done, released last year and won all those awards.\n\n\r\nSo, Martin's gonna call Leonardo and Leonardo was raised on raw milk because he was a patient with Paul Fleiss who was a pediatrician.\n\n\r\nLooks like everything's going very well, but I don't know if we're gonna be able to get ahold of Leonardo, cause he's probably one of the busiest actors there is.\n\n\r\nRaised on that raw milk, he's one of the brightest minds we have.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe did that 11th hour documentary also about planetary survival\r\n\n\r\nHe's a very conscious young man.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAnother thing on the legal thing.\n\n Is ODP and Claravale working with you on this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I don't want them working with me?\n\n I want separate suits.\n\n\r\nI think even Sally Fallon's attorney doing one and then mark has his own attorney.\n\n So, we're gonna go at the state of California with three lawsuits.\n\n It's always better cuz the judge can't get by with throwing out three.\n\n They may get away with throwing out one of the cases, but no judge is gonna get by throwing out all three cases.\n\n \r\nEven if they throw out mine, we're in federal court overnight.\n\n because it's a federal issue, it's a constitutional issue.\n\n It's even in the California constitution.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Raw Vs Pasteurized Dairy \n \n \n \n \n### (40) Remove Amalgams Afer 2 Years On Diet \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nShe asked, how about dental amalgams, which have a lot of mercury they're like 25% to 30% mercury\n\n And of course, methyl mercury, even when the solidified crystallized into a metal form with alloys it is still highly toxic, and if it's liquid and it will leak with your body acids and get up into the nerves and go into the brain.\n\n\r\nSo, when you have those removed, I suggest that people be on the diet at least two and a half years before they do that, because I've known some people, I had one fellow I pleaded with him.\n\n He has severe chemical sensitivities and he is getting better and better on the diet, and everybody kept telling him, \"Oh, on the internet.\n\n Oh, if you have your amalgams removed, it'll change your whole life\".\n\n I said, \"Don't do it.\n\n Don't do it.\n\n Don't do it.\n\n You've only been on the diet 9, 10 months don't do it\".\n\n He did it, and he's never been the same since, you can't even recover.\n\n So, he's having a hard time recovering.\n\n \r\nYour body starts pulling the mercury out of the nerves, so you're in a constant detoxification.\n\n And for one molecule of mercury, it takes about 1000 white blood cells to 10,000 white blood cells to harness that one molecule of mercury to keep it from doing damage.\n\n That takes a hell of a lot of nutrients.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think you were saying there's no safe process to get rid of them really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can be safe in your mouth and you may not inhale it, but it's the nerves that are detoxing that have collected all the mercury from all the years that you've had in your teeth?\n\n\r\nMost people don't have bad symptoms when they go on to a good diet.\n\n\r\nMercury is the worst toxin, it's the worst animal toxin we have on this planet, then thimerosal is next.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI had one removed and I did feel better after a month and a half.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut that was just one.\n\n Maybe you want to have one done every six months, you might get away with it, but still you're at risk if you're in bad shape.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Sleep Apnea, Protein Deficiency \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSleep apnea\n\n Is there any nutritional way you can help that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you have true sleep apnea where you can't sleep any time of the day, that's a severe protein deficiency and sometimes a person can digest the protein, but not utilize and assimilate it because they don't have enough fat?\n\n So, that can be a problem.\n\n \r\nNow, if your sleep apnea, your inability to sleep is because you can't sleep at nightTime, that's not sleep apnea.\n\n It means your nervous system is detoxifying and you can't sleep, usually between midnight and five o'clock in the morning.\n\n And if you go to sleep earlier, you'll usually wake up somewhere around 2:00 AM and you won't be able to go back to sleep until about 5:30 AM.\n\n That's usually how it works.\n\n\r\nIf you try to go to sleep at midnight, you won't be able to, and you won't be able to get to sleep until like five o'clock in the morning.\n\n You may doze a little bit, but when the nervous system is detoxifying like that, it's like a person who's had a head injury and you can't let them go to sleep because they may not wake up, they can go into a coma.\n\n \r\nSo, when the nervous system is detoxifying during the nighttime, and that's when it detoxifies 92%, something like that, the brain and nervous system detoxify at night when everything else is shut down, but the heart and the lungs, and neurological activity in the brain.\n\n\r\nSo, if you can't sleep at night, it's not really sleep apnea.\n\n It's your nervous system detoxifying.\n\n So, what do you have to do is sleep 5:30 AM - 7:00 AM.\n\n You have to go to work, go to sleep at 8:00PM, up at 1:00 AM - 2:00 AM, and then do something constructive between 1:30 AM & 5:00 AM.\n\n If you try to sleep and you can't, you're just gonna drive yourself crazy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Surery Uses Antiseptics, Natural Antiseptics \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you have surgery, what do they do\n\n They put chemicals in there and then they put an antiseptic that's either methylate or mercurochrome, both of those are liquid mercury or iodine, which is highly antibacterial, just like mercury is, only it's radioactive if you get an x-ray?\n\n\r\nThey always coat you with an antiseptic.\n\n Always coat you inside and outside.\n\n\r\nIf they're using methylate or mercurochrome, either one or even the iodine, it will look yellow, kind of an orangeish-yellow.\n\n If you took your bandage off, you would've seen it and they do it on the inside.\n\n \r\nSo, it may be 10 years before your heal.\n\n This one will heal in a year completely, and this is a split tibia.\n\n I split the tibia in two in the motorcycle accident, ripped this and this.\n\n I ripped the tendons off of this ankle and shaved this whole bone down on the pavement and then shaved all this bone down on the pavement.\n\n You don't see any scarring there, all the skin was gone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo what did you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what I did first is I put lime juice on because lime juice is an antiseptic?\n\n It will coat any particle That's entered the body and coat it, So your body doesn't have to use white blood cells to surround, So you don't have a mass infection, but I put coconut cream over that, everything stinks, and then honey over that.\n\n \r\nAnd then the areas where I lost more than just skin when I had muscle and bone removed, I put thin slices of meat over that.\n\n And then I took little pieces of plastic and then put that over, so the meat wouldn't dry out and then wrapped it in an ACE bandage.\n\n And that was all over the leg and all over this arm all the way back to here cause I'd taken all the skin off and I healed all of the skin in two weeks.\n\n\r\nJust this little bit of scarring here and here, I have this little bit of scar here, this dark color.\n\n That's all that I have left of it.\n\n A few little discolorations here.\n\n \r\nStay on the diet, it will heal eventually.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, high meat is good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, high meat isn't necessarily appropriate, that's for the brain and nervous system?\n\n Meat is good.\n\n Red meat and fish together would be good to heal that a little quicker, and you could put lime juice and coconut and cream on the outside to try to draw those poisons out that are in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo operation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm saying no operations?\n\n I went to the hospital, cuz I was in so much pain that I thought that my knee was dislocated, cuz I had the lump here and the lump here, so the whole knee looked like it was like this, but after the x-rays it just showed that was in place, just these tendons here had ripped, and they were bubbled up like that.\n\n They were ripped off, completely ripped off.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you can grow that back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt was ripped from here, completely ripped from here and bubbled up here, bunched up here?\n\n So, in a week, it grew all the way back, right back to where it was supposed to attach and reattached.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou stayed off it during that time, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I stayed off for six weeks?\n\n Very little, to go to the toilet, to get in a wheelchair for six and a half weeks.\n\n I did go into the ocean twice a day in the morning and evening, to walk.\n\n I did walk in the ocean where my body was lighter.\n\n So, I walked about two miles each day in the ocean almost every day.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Tribes That

mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether and detergent\n\n And the amount of mercury that they use, even though you'll see now preservative free, they're not mercury free.\n\n They just changed, they used to call mercury a preservative.\n\n Now they're calling it an antibacterial antiseptic, so they just came the name of it, but it's still mercury.\n\n\r\nThey'd gone from 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury to 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury.\n\n In my laboratory work, it only took 3000 molecules of mercury to make 2 CCS of fluid sterile.\n\n \r\nWhy would they be using 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury and an equal amount of aluminum and formaldehyde in a two CCS of a vaccine.\n\n \r\nTo hurt you?\n\n That is the only reason, that's the only logical sense about it, it's to hurt you.\n\n Nobody's challenging it because all the people who work for the pharmaceutical industries are under contract, so there'll be whistleblowers and we just don't have a whistleblower yet.\n\n We

\n \n### (45) Vinegar Can Cause Mienral Ibalance \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe're talking about chelation therapy and EDT and chemicals like that\n\n They're all manufactured in a laboratory.\n\n There's nothing natural about them, but the EDT, which is a particular type of amino acid, the protein is found in vinegar.\n\n \r\nNow, if you're going to eat vinegar to help get rid of plaque, if you have them in your arteries, veins, arteries, anywhere like that.\n\n You need to take a small amount because it does cause a mineral imbalance, so it can cause a bleeding.\n\n It can cause internal bleeding, stuff like that.\n\n Of course it doesn't have the side effects of the toxicity that the EDTA and the other chemicals have, but it will cause a mineral imbalance, a mineral loss.\n\n It could cause osteoporosis, a damaging and a weakening of your cellular, structure by demineralization.\n\n So, you have to make sure that you're eating enough cheese.\n\n Now remember, raw cheese, when it's raw is not digestible.\n\n It acts as a sponge, so as you eat it, it starts in the mouth.\n\n It passes down through your entire elementary canal, it will act as a magnet.\n\n It'll draw the poisons out of your lymphatic system, your neurological fluid and your bloodstream as those pass through and weave through the entire digestive tract.\n\n So the raw cheese will act as a magnet, draw the poisons, heavy metals of the toxins out of those 3 serums and hold it like a sponge and pass it out in the feces.\n\n \r\nCooked cheese, pasteurized cheese will not do that cuz it's fractionated.\n\n So, it'll absorb those toxins and then reabsorb into the body.\n\n So, you'll just re keep recycling it, so it has to be raw cheese.\n\n Salt causes greater imbalances, so it has to be a non salted cheese.\n\n \r\nWhen you want to digest the minerals and the fats and the proteins and the cheese, you have to eat it with a little honey, provide the enzymes that are missing in it.\n\n\r\nSo, if you want a good mineral supplement, a good calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, concentrated supplement, cheese is it, but you have to have a tiny bit of honey with the cheese and they have to be either mixed in something like a cheesecake or you have to mix the honey and the cheese together in the mouth, then you will absorb those minerals and other things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n

the roosters crow.\n\n Rooster crowing make the sunrise?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut like 1000 people get the cold?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot all of them get it.\n\n Why don't all of them get it.\n\n If every household and everybody got it, you could say there's a good probability of contagion, but it isn't?\n\n The bacteria that you find in one individual is very different from another, could be the same strain.\n\n\r\nWhenever you hear, \"Oh, well we fingerprinted it the bacteria\".\n\n Big fricking deal, all fingerprinting does is tell you the particular strain of E.\n\n coli or salmonella.\n\n It does not tell you anything about yeah, the bacteria that's in you is the exact same one that's in the food you ate.\n\n Absolutely bonko.\n\n\r\nSo, fingerprinting a bacteria is not like our fingerprints, which are individual to the person.\n\n My fingerprints are on a crime scene, I was most likely there, or I had been there at that location at some time and I may be a suspect, but did I do it.\n\n Don't know?\n\n \r\nIn the fingerprinting of bacteria, all you know is strain.\n\n That's like knowing a race.\n\n Okay, an Irish person was at the scene of the crime, so okay, we blame all Irish people for the crime and that's what happens when the health department and the pharmaceutical and medical industry attack a bacteria and say it's contagious, not contagious.\n\n\r\nEverybody has bacteria in their body, everybody is cleaning.\n\n Most families eat the same things, the same garbage.\n\n So, of course they're collecting the same kind of poisons, relatively uniformly together, so what happens.\n\n They detox together?\n\n The whole planet detoxes together, that's why we have a flu season and get it.\n\n Flu season! Not a flu epidemic or pandemic?\n\n They're advertising we're gonna have the Avion flu pandemic soon, right.\n\n Plastered all over the news?\n\n Well, this Avion flu vaccine that they created, that virus was active 18 months ago.\n\n It's not active now.\n\n\r\nFlus are mainly viral detoxification, colds are mainly bacterial detoxification, which can involve a little bit of virus and colds are mainly bacterial, but may involve a little bit of virus.\n\n So, you don't have a contagion involved in that, virus are not alive.\n\n You've got no nucleus, you've got no respiratory system, you've got no digestive system.\n\n They are protein structures that either disassemble or reassemble.\n\n\r\nAnd during a flu, you have specific viruses, which will disassemble certain kinds of tissue.\n\n So, let's say you are going to clean out your respiratory system and the cell itself is cleaning out its respiratory system.\n\n The viruses, you could have 300,000 viruses just for the inside of all the various tissues within one cell.\n\n If the body had all of those viruses working at one time, the whole cell would dissolve your whole body would dissolve and you would be dead, and that's what the pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe.\n\n\r\nSo, they show you a little picture of one virus working to dissolve a certain tissue, and they say, \"Oh, it'll spread and go all over and it'll destroy your whole body\".\n\n No, those virus are specific to that particular tissue, it will only disassemble that tissue.\n\n That is it.\n\n \r\nAnd then they say, \"It's contagious\".\n\n Is tide soap contagious.\n\n  \r\n30 years ago, doctors understood that virus was not contagious, that's why they didn't use antibiotics with a virus?\n\n Pharmaceutical industry says, \"Hey, we can make a lot of money to say that they're alive and contagious\".\n\n\r\nSo, now they're giving antibiotics for viral infection.\n\n It's the most absurd thing in the world, going on their premise even.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Windows \n \n**[2007],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, I wanna just ask you something\n\n If this would be appropriate to put up on my window, I brought this material here, which is sort of like a plastic, you know, when they're spraying, I feel my window.\n\n Someone said, and that air doesn't go through.\n\n Cause I've been feeling it when they're chemically spraying our air.\n\n\r\nAnd if that's a good thing to put up on the window, it's plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you've got a powder here that they used to keep the plastic from sealing to each other when they melt it and form it.\n\n So, that powder is very toxic, probably more toxic than what they're dumping in the air.\n\n So, if you're going to do that, you need to wear a mask, spread these out on the driveway out there, and then hose them down and wipe 'em down to get that stuff of of there.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust hose 'em down and then wipe 'em off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n And then you can tape them around your windows.\n\n If you're going to do that, it's 3.\n\n6, six millimeters.\n\n That's very thick, you don't need anything that thick, but it's okay.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat should I get.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Kathy]**\n\r\nProbably will tear less easily, so it's probably better to use this if you want to repeatedly use them, \r\n\n\r\nAll I need to do spread them out and hose them down?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHose them down, and wipe them?\n\n Wipe them dry, make sure you have all that powder off.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

from a \n up in the mountains, and come all the way down here\n\n So, it's 45 minutes to an hour trip.\n\n So, I shop one day a week.\n\n I get home, I cut my meat up in slices.\n\n I put in quart white mouth jelly jars, lid on it, put it in the refrigerator.\n\n I don't pack it so tightly that there's no air, there's airspace in it.\n\n \r\nAnd I've had it last three weeks that way.\n\n When I've had wild game, I've had in there for a year without opening it and opened it a year later.\n\n To the day a year later, there was no odor to it.\n\n  \r\nThe longest I've kept cultivated meat is three months without detecting any odor.\n\n \r\nI keep the lid on tightly unless I'm making high meat, but then I keep it on tight in my refrigerator because I don't want it stinking up my refrigerator.\n\n  \r\nBut if I got the refrigerator outside for my high meat, I let the refrigerator stink to high meat.\n\n I almost said high heaven.\n\n \r\nThat will help presere your milk.\n\n If you want your milk, just add some honey to it.\n\n It will last longer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, milk on the counter.\n\n It's good for how long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's good forever?\n\n It just becomes cheese.\n\n \r\nif you have the cream, and honey with it, and it turns into kefir and then separates and part turns whey, you shake it or blend it.\n\n It's right back the way it was.\n\n It becomes emulsified again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFish fish lasts about 10 days without stinking, but still, it's okay?\n\n If you want to keep it longer, you could take just a little bit of lemon, and a little lime.\n\n \r\nLime is an antibacterial, lemon is a fermenter.\n\n That's why they use lemon to make cevici.\n\n \r\nLime is an antibacterial, so it does not break it down the same way.\n\n \r\nAnd again, keep your fish in jars.\n\n Glass jars with a lid.\n\n \r\nEverything will keep longer in glass.\n\n Keep it in plastic that phalates gas, and they may cause phlalate gases to start reacting with the tissue, and it starts breaking it down into a foul odor, get really slimy.\n\n So, put it in glass, takes a very long time for fish to even get that way.\n\n  \r\nChicken will never get that way in glass, but it will in a plastic bag, even if it was a Ziploc.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI found the chicken to be the most economic \r\n\n \r\nOh yes, definitely.\n\n Yeah, but you look like you have some symptoms of anemia, so you need the red meat.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut I got some buffalo shit \r\n\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nIs it crucial that you cut the meat, and fish before you put it in glass jars.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt fits easier.\n\n  \r\nI mean you can slam it down in there, and try to get it out, which I've done it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) All Shampoos Are Toxic \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAll shampoos are no good\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll shampoos, there's none of them?\n\n Unless you make your own, you can take coconut cream blended with egg you got a natural soap.\n\n Great soap.\n\n \r\nOr you just use a raw egg on your hair.\n\n Just make sure that if you use raw by itself that you wet your hair before you put the egg in it or else your hair is gonna smell like egg?\n\n\r\nFor some reason, if you put the raw egg on your hair, whipped eggs, so the yellow, and white are mixed together.\n\n If you put that on while your hair is wet, it won't smell like egg for some reason.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSome people put avocado on their hair, does that work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can, but your avocado oil dries into a black hardened oil?\n\n It's not a smooth oil.\n\n\r\nBecause it's a hardened oil.\n\n It becomes brittle.\n\n Like if you leave an avocado out, you'll see it turn black and it'll flake, you know.\n\n\r\nSo, that's the kind of oil it is?\n\n So, it creates like a firmer oil, so it will straighten the hair, and it's like putting a little bit of a hairspray in it.\n\n So, it will keep a particular form or shape.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Book Bioattack Alert \n \n \n \n \n### (5) Brain Detoxes Metals & Cooked Metals Mostly \n \n \n \n \n### (6) Breathing Exercises Good & Carbon Dioxide \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPranayama are breathing exercises, yoga breathing exercises, \n\n\n**[unclear]**\n means body movement exercises.\n\n Pranayama is when you're holding one side to the count of 7, and exhale to the count of 7.\n\n \r\nThat's about what they say, but some people can only inhale to the count of 3, and exhale to the count of 3.\n\n I can inhale it for a count of 90 seconds, and exhale for 90 seconds.\n\n If I practice, I can do one inhalation, and one exhalation in five minutes.\n\n \r\nSo, I can really control, and lower my heartbeat.\n\n That's what pranayama is, controlled breathing.\n\n A lot of people feel that oxygen is very, very important.\n\n So are carbon dioxides.\n\n That's why people who have panic attacks breathe into a bag, and they get more carbon dioxide and that settle them.\n\n  \r\nSo, oxygen is overrated if you're saying it's more important than carbon dioxide, it is not, they're both needed fairly equal.\n\n That's why pranayama works.\n\n You inhale.\n\n You hold your breath to the same count, and you exhale.\n\n So, you're exercising your lungs less, you're producing less carbon dioxide, and waste products because you're allowing by the use the oxygen that is has, and even reuse a lot of carbon dioxide.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Butter & Egg With Meat To Generate Hormones \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, in the time to make the change over, it gets exhausted, and then it stops creating a hormone\n\n That's only because you're not getting the right fats, and proteins together.\n\n \r\nSo, anytime you want to make sure that you're generating hormones, you have eat butter or eggs with meat.\n\n Cream doesn't quite do it, except for maybe the pituitary gland or the pineal.\n\n\r\nWell for all the other glands, it takes butter or egg with meat to generate hormones.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou could use the lube formula maybe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n That would be better.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) C Sections \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCesarean sections are awful like I said in my first book, women who have C-sections will take minimum of eight years to revitalize this area to get normal circulation\n\n You have to realize when they go in and cut, whether it's laterally or horizontally, they're cutting all of the circulation in.\n\n \r\nWhether it's lymph, nerve, blood circulation, muscle.\n\n It's all cut.\n\n So, you've broken all the natural flows, and connection to that part of the body.\n\n That's why when women have those, all of a sudden, they got these ripples in this skin that is not fed properly, and it's pretty weak, and damaged tissue, so they're not a good thing at all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do they do them so frequently or what leads to the problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMost doctors don't want to wait around in the hospital?\n\n\r\nTheir time is too valuable.\n\n It's more valuable than your wife's stomach, and eight years she's going to take minimum if she's on a perfect diet to heal that area, but they don't want to wait two hours.\n\n\r\nThey don't want to wait 10 hours for your wife to have a baby.\n\n They'll just cut her.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, they'll use the excuse that there were complications.\n\n They need to do a C-section.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you challenge him, say what were the complications.\n\n Prove it, they'll lose a lawsuit?\n\n\r\n96% of the time they will lose because they're lying.\n\n If you've got a baby with a cord around his neck, he's got a good argument.\n\n The baby can be worked around, undone, but the mother could suffer a lot from that pain.\n\n She may be in contractions at the same time, and the C-section might be a good idea or she's losing blood pressure, and you're going to try to save her life by doing it.\n\n\r\nBut that's only, you know, 2 to 4% of all the C-sections.\n\n That means 96 to 98% of the C-sections are the doctor's time.\n\n He does not want to stay in there waiting for the woman to have a baby.\n\n\r\nI know my first wife, she went into labor, and the baby was 22 inches long, eight and a half pounds.\n\n She's 5' 4, and you know, that baby split her all the way to the rectum and into the rectum an inch, and he was so big.\n\n\r\nThat's a different thing, but if she had been on a proper diet, and not been a donut, she'd have been able to withstand that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Carbs Store 90 % Ages \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nGo in there and eat it up\n\n Eliminate it because we just eat too much of it or the regular.\n\n We live too much on that in our lifetime, and we're full of it.\n\n The Columbia University found that humans, if they eat carbohydrate foods, store 70 to 90% of the byproduct, even if it's raw 70 to 90% of the advanced glycation end products are stored in the body, human body.\n\n \r\nThat's a lot of sugar byproduct.\n\n So, that's why we want to get away from eating too much fruit or at least eat green fruit, so we don't have all those high carbs.\n\n We have more enzyme activity.\n\n So, the body has to use yeast to eat up this toxicity or else it remains in the body and causes disease.\n\n So, when a woman gets pregnant, she has to take care of that area pretty well.\n\n \r\nOr if the years are forming in the liver, candida, which is more skin oriented, but it can also go internally in the intestines.\n\n But there's lots of youth that propagates throughout the system, and they are necessary, they are all necessary.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Chinese Were Forced To Eat Grains Cuz Slaves \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI'll try to ask you about things like old ancient healing techniques, like Tai Chi, Chinese medicine, I'm going to feel better, and they don't work\n\n Why doesn't the old stuff work that they've been using for a long time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDid everybody hear that?\n\n  \r\nHe said why doesn't exercise, and the old disciplines like Chinese medicine?\n\n Why doesn't it work for us now.\n\n \r\nAyurvedic medicine was geared toward your lackeys?\n\n Lackeys are your slaves that do minion work.\n\n They go out there and grow the rice patties, mine the rice patties, and the water, buffalo, and all the cows, and whatever else, chickens or whatever, they were only allowed to eat 10% meat maximum, 10% vegetables, 80% rice.\n\n \r\nThat was the rule.\n\n That was the law.\n\n If you were a warrior, you could eat 50% meat, 10% vegetables, 40% rice.\n\n If you were royalty, you could eat 90% meat.\n\n Why is that.\n\n Because the higher, the rate of carbohydrates, the less you had emotional, and mental control, you were also hyperactive, and needed to be out in the field working?\n\n \r\nIf you were eating high meat content, you can be intellectual, and overthrow the government, and they did not want that.\n\n So, I rebate, medicine was created for the lackeys, the servants, the slaves in the fields because they were not allowed to eat a lot of meat.\n\n So, they had to come up with all these very contorted methods to try to treat them.\n\n \r\nIt was very difficult, and it didn't work very often.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhere did you get that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI was reading in a document from a Chinese scholar, and he translated it?\n\n I forget which dynasty it was from; it was from 1100, and that was the law of diet.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs that the same for avurvedic medicine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n  \r\nThey had the same thing in India as well, same thing with the lackeys there.\n\n They never let them have enough money to be eating a lot of meat.\n\n \r\nBut when they started, like in the United States, everybody is becoming wealthy, or they can afford to eat a lot of meat.\n\n So, what they did was they put it in law.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Clean Teeth With Water Pick \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to do a good cleansing, deep cleansing\n\n Get a water jet, and put carbonated water in there with a little bit of baking soda if you want.\n\n \r\nYou don't have to use baking soda if you don't want it to break up quickly, you can just use a little bit of lemon juice, a little bit of vinegar, and the carbonated water.\n\n\r\nAnd you shoot that around in there, within a week you're going to be clean without all the brutality, and pain.\n\n\r\nYou shouldn't have your teeth cleaned at the dental office.\n\n It will damage your gums and cause more pain.\n\n Plus they usually shoot you with a Novacane, and that causes hardening tissue, hardening lumps in the face.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cococream As Shampoo \n \n \n \n \n### (13) Coconut Cream Lightens Skin \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUm, of the more desirable women, if you're dark\n\n So, they like to get light.\n\n So, what they do is take coconut cream, and put it on at night, and it lightens their skin.\n\n \r\nEvery night you put it on, your skin will get lighter and lighter.\n\n So, if you had that kind of consciousness, that's a natural way to do it.\n\n\r\nRather than bleaching your skin.\n\n\r\nI like dark.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Coppper IUD \n \n \n \n \n### (15) Diet Is Terrible Now People Used To Die In The Cold \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBut it depends upon what they're fed\n\n The American diet up until 50 years ago, you had meat at every meal, the breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\n You had meat at every meal.\n\n Now it's once a day, maybe once a week.\n\n It's the same garbage that they're handing people, and we're getting more and more and more disease.\n\n \r\nAnd the, the false information that people are living longer has nothing to do with the medical profession, and it has nothing to do with our diets, healthy diets.\n\n It has to do with, we are now sheltered from the intense cold, and the intense heats, which will kill people quickly.\n\n Can you imagine a hundred years ago, you don't have a fire like that in your house, and you can't afford to burn one and you can't afford to get the wood because you're in a city where there is no more wood, cause all the trees have been cut down, and you can't afford to get wood.\n\n So, you don't have a fire unless it's for cooking and you freeze at night.\n\n A woman, unless she was Angelia's size, she would not be considered a good woman choice to breed children.\n\n \r\nBecause it's likely that she would survive every year, year after year, even if she had a baby in the winter, she would survive.\n\n But this young lady would be a bad choice because she's so thin.\n\n \r\nBut because we have heat, and we have air conditioning.\n\n That prevents all these deaths, and we're living longer only because of that.\n\n And that is sole reason.\n\n Take a look when we have power shortages in the winters, all of a sudden you have 230 people die in one night, cuz they don't have heat and we're not talking about just old people and young people we're talking about of all ages.\n\n \r\nBecause their blood gets too thick and cold and they die.\n\n 100 years ago, we didn't have heat and air conditioning.\n\n A heat wave also, hundreds of people will die in heat wave without air conditioning.\n\n And that is the sole reason that they can say people are living longer, and also, we have refrigeration, so we do have more nutrients in our food because they retain longer.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Don't Eat Too Much Fruit For Teeth \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGood dental practice\n\n \r\nKeep your teeth.\n\n Take care of your teeth.\n\n \r\nDon't eat much fruit.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Eggs As Shampoo \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOr you can just use a raw egg on your hair\n\n Just make sure that if gonna use a raw egg by itself, that you wet your hair before you put the egg on or else your hair's gonna smell like egg.\n\n\r\nFor some reason, if you put the egg on raw egg on your hair, whipped egg so yellow and the white mixed together.\n\n So, you put that on when it's wet your hair doesn't smell like egg for some reason.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been doing it dry all these years.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Fat Vs Skinny Women \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNo, she was not skinny\n\n \r\nI didn't say anything negative about that.\n\n I favor fat and happy.\n\n I'd much rather have an overweight, half overweight, happy mate than a skinny fanatic crazy woman.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou got it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLet me tell you, I dated Twiggy one night, and that was it.\n\n 1972.\n\n I took her to a premier of Butterflies Are Free at the cinema.\n\n \r\nThis was the first night it opened.\n\n The new APCO on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\n So, we go in and watch the movie, everything is great.\n\n We go out, I didn't want to fight with the the crowds, and the publicity and all that.\n\n So, I said, let's go out through the back, the back fire exit, and we'll have the limo meet us out there.\n\n \r\nSo, we went out the back and the building supplies still in the back there.\n\n Gosh, I hope that isn't locked, and I hope this wasn't locked and I just went to grab it and it closed before I got to it and it was locked.\n\n She panicked.\n\n \r\nShe just went hysterical.\n\n Oh, we're trapped in here, and she started screaming and crying and yelling.\n\n And this went on for five minutes and I said, listen, just calm down.\n\n All we have to is go to the door before you start screaming.\n\n That was just the thought, you know, so it doesn't mean this could be locked.\n\n \r\nThe exit isn't locked, we went right out.\n\n And that was the last time I dated her.\n\n That was the last time I called her, you know, because I mean, she'd panic over something like that easily.\n\n That's not the kind of person I want to be with.\n\n And let me tell you, every skinny person I've ever dated is on that level of panic.\n\n \r\nThey don't have any fat to calm their system.\n\n \r\nMen do too.\n\n Not just women, men do too.\n\n I was that way when I was skinny.\n\n Maybe not quite that badly, not close.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Forceps Used On Baby \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nA woman I know recently had a baby, and during the birthing process, apparently there was some difficulty\n\n The doctor had used a forceps, which I thought forceps were outlaw.\n\n But anyway, apparently, they had actually used it on the baby's head, literally turned the entire fetus, and then pulled it out.\n\n So, right now the baby's two weeks old, but already has deep scar tissue along here, and on here.\n\n \r\nWhat are the long-term effects of a child being used the forceps, and can it be reversed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI've known about probably 8 children that were forceps pulled, and I've seen pictures when they were babies, and they developed out of it fine?\n\n I've seen 2 that did not, that were deformed by it, but they were raised on the worst diets you could imagine.\n\n \r\nThey got very little.\n\n One was Asian, and the family was very poor, and the other one was Indian, also very poor.\n\n So, they never had the meat to regenerate the tissue, and grow quickly while the baby was young, young enough.\n\n But the other 8 did fine, but it depends upon.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Fresh Vs Fermented Milk \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, I just wanted to know about generally the role of milk?\n\n Like I hear about people having problems with fresh raw milk, you know, not fermented.\n\n \r\nIs fermented milk better than fresh milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDid everyone hear the question?\n\n  \r\nIs fermented milk better than fresh milk?\n\n \r\nIt always is because the fermented milk has allowed the natural bacteria- you have free basic categories of bacteria that naturally exist in raw milk, unless they're fed antibiotics?\n\n**[unclear]**\n, and acidophilus.\n\n  \r\nAcidophilus breaks down the sugar, the lactate.\n\n \r\nThe bulgaricus breaks down the fats.\n\n**[unclear]**\n breaks down the protein.\n\n  \r\nSo, you naturally have the bacteria in there predigesting it for you.\n\n Just like in the stomach, it all goes sour before you digest it.\n\n Cause it starts breaking it down, but that's the bacteria, and the acids in your stomach doing it.\n\n A lot of people are not very well to do that efficiently.\n\n \r\nSo, to let the milk ferment is always preferable.\n\n Mine sits in the cupboard under the sink, dark cupboard out of the refrigerator, usually a minimum of two days before I drink it.\n\n I like it wonderfully tasting though.\n\n**[unclear]**\n \r\nAnd that means that the fat is broken down higher than the protein and the sugar, and it causes it to go a little heavy and a little bit not so pleasant tasting a little bitter.\n\n**[unclear]**\n to grow by adding a little honey, let's say a tablespoon and a half per court, and have about two ounces of cream.\n\n \r\nThe, the milk will always be delicious.\n\n Even if it's down there, 2 to 3 days, just becomes kefir.\n\n Any time it's predigested, you are going to get more nutrition from it.\n\n If you let the bacteria that naturally exists in the milk perform that activity of predigesting.\n\n You will encourage your own bacteria in your intestines to flourish.\n\n \r\nIf you make it with a cultured kefir grains or yogurt drains.\n\n It will not do that.\n\n Those are washed, those are bread.\n\n Those are specific, and they're no longer natural.\n\n They will predigest the milk substances for you, but they will not encourage your own bacteria to grow.\n\n So, it's fine if you need to get well, and you need to digest, and you need the milk a little bit faster digesting cause of the grain you can digest it about a day quicker.\n\n \r\nBut preferably you let your milk digest on its own with natural bacteria in the raw milk.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Fruit & Teeth Decay \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're probably eating too much fruit, and you're going to continue to do decay, and you'll need to have a filling\n\n\r\nNow up until about two years ago, I still ate a lot of fruit, and I still continued to have a little decay.\n\n Not a lot.\n\n It was very minor, but it still continued.\n\n \r\nOnce I cut out the fruit or cut it down to one a day or less.\n\n\r\nAll the decay stopped completed.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Hemeroids & Yearst Infections While Pregnant \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, what causes yeasts, and hemorrhoid's and why especially when a woman's pregnant\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat was about three questions *Laughs*?\n\n  \r\nThere was a question about hemorrhoids.\n\n \r\nThere was a question about yeast infection, and there was another one about.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n what was the other one.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy, especially when you're pregnant, why do they come up then?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, why do a lot of, why do some women have yeast infections, have hemorrhoid's all at the same time when they're pregnant?\n\n The baby has to be protected if it's going to live.\n\n \r\nThere's a lot of toxicity stored in all the tissues, and as that uterus is expanding, and those ovaries are still producing a protective hormone to keep the baby from dropping.\n\n Your bodies producing mucus, that system is working harder than it's ever worked, and if there's toxicity in it, it has to be removed.\n\n \r\nCan you imagine if you had some mercury or aluminum stored in a little area in your uterus, and it ripped.\n\n It wouldn't heal.\n\n The aluminum knocks out the Zeta principle.\n\n  \r\nThe zeta principle is the ability for substances to stay emulsified, suspended in fluids.\n\n If you take aluminum and drop just a pin drop, I mean just a tiny fraction of a drop into a gallon of milk, all the minerals will hit the bottom.\n\n \r\nIt will zap all the electromagnetic energy out of anything that's in it.\n\n It is then not emulsified, and the nutrients will not be utilized properly.\n\n  \r\nAluminum is a dangerous substance.\n\n It's as bad as mercury because it can destroy your nutrients.\n\n Mercury causes burning, and damage to the tissue, but it does no more damage than the aluminum does.\n\n It's different damage.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you have those in your tissues when you're growing and expanding with a fetus, you're likely to lose the fetus if you don't detoxify.\n\n Hemorrhoids are always a discharge through the skin.\n\n It's usually a heavy metal.\n\n It's usually aluminum, mercury or cadmium or lead coming out.\n\n \r\nAnd if you've ever had a hemorrhoid analyzed for its content un the pus that it comes out, or the blood that discharges from it, you'll find that it is very high in poisons.\n\n Sometimes even medical poisons that are injected.\n\n Most of those aluminum, and mercury come from vaccine in other medications that are injected.\n\n \r\nBut it doesn't just have to be those particular varieties.\n\n If you shot up cocaine or shot up any drug, even if they were recreational, you still have those alkaloids, those heavy metals, those free radicals that will cause damage.\n\n And if they cannot go through the intestines, can you imagine if you had a hemorrhoid in an intestine, you'd have an ulceration, a perforation, and you'd have peritonitis: possibly die.\n\n \r\nSo, the body puts it out through the skin in the rectal area or in the butt.\n\n So, that's a very dangerous substance.\n\n So, you don't want it coming out anywhere else.\n\n Butt is the easiest way, and best way for the body to get rid of it.\n\n  \r\nYeasts.\n\n Again, those are sugar byproducts that are being fed on.\n\n You have acrylamides, advanced glycation end products, yeasts that you've eaten in breads.\n\n \r\nJust the sugar byproducts that have collected and damaged the cells.\n\n The only way for the body to get rid of them is to breed yeast infections.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Homosexuals, Aids and Cirrhosis \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is not factual\n\n There's no proof that anybody has ever gotten aids from their partner, either heterosexual or homosexual.\n\n It is a casual connection, not scientifically proven.\n\n \r\nThere are 273 couples where one of them has been infected for up to 28 years, and none of the partners have gotten it.\n\n None of the partners have gotten HIV.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you're thinking the only way that it could move is by injection.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nInjection.\n\n That's it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I'm not saying wrong, but are there statistics that would suggest that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, all the people that I know who got HIV all had the hepatitis vaccine?\n\n\r\nThat was the War Department's use of it.\n\n They put it in the hepatitis vaccine because in the 70s and 80s, 90% of the people getting hepatitis were homosexuals.\n\n They were doing a lot of drugs, a lot of amyl nitrate, and damaging the livers.\n\n So, they were getting hepatitis, which is a virus which breaks down the toxic liver tissue, so that you can regenerate it and get well.\n\n\r\nSo, viruses are good.\n\n We use viruses when we can use bacteria and parasites, and molds because it's too toxic.\n\n They go in and eat that organic tissue, this pollution, get poisoned, and they die.\n\n So you cannot use those to clean that liver because you've got all those heavy metals from the drugs.\n\n\r\nSo, the body uses solvents, which are virus, cellular made soaps.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) How HIV Was Made From Aids \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNo, AIDS is a faulty immune system, HIV is a virus, but it's manmade\n\n Dr.\n\n Strecker found that it was made at UCLA in 1961 - 1962.\n\n They had created the virus by taking two viruses, one from the lymphonomic virus of a sheep, and one from the leukemic virus of a cow, spliced them together.\n\n He tried to fractionate them 1000 times.\n\n \r\nAnd every time they came in two, usually when you fractionate a cell it will break apart into five pieces, five parts.\n\n Like we dismember at our joints, at are limbs.\n\n This would always break in two, and he realized, wait, that this has to be a manmade splice cell.\n\n So, he put the two sides together that matched, and found out he had those two diseases, took the names of those two diseases.\n\n \r\nHe was going to go to Duke, Harvard, Yale, Berkley, and UCLA to see if it were created in one of those major universities that were working with viruses, and he found it at UCLA.\n\n He took the name of those two diseases and put 'em in 15 different ways that they may have called it, and it came up at UCLA.\n\n \r\nThat was given to the war department.\n\n So, he called his brother who was an attorney, also a Strecker, and said, here's the situation.\n\n You should look into it.\n\n This HIV is injected by our war department.\n\n See what you can find out.\n\n So, he got a Senator from either Wisconsin or Minnesota to back it, and they started doing Illinois.\n\n \r\nThey went after the war department, and let me tell you, after they got all that information, both of 'em were dead in three months after the book was published.\n\n Three months after the book was published, they were found dead.\n\n What's the name.\n\n Both dead?\n\n Neither of 'em was suicidal, and they said it was suicide.\n\n Neither.\n\n 'em had even a inkling of suicide.\n\n No depression, no anything.\n\n Anger, but no depression.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) How Long Food Lasts \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I'm relatively new to the raw foods diet, several months, and it's kind of a broad question, but whatever wealth of information you can help me with around economics tips\n\n\r\nI'm finding one of the most interesting things for me is that I don't require as much food.\n\n\r\nSo, some of the quantities that I need to buy a milk for various things, I can't finish it.\n\n Um, and how long do things last.\n\n What orders should I things,  economics is part of this question too because I find it expensive?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVery expensive diet, probably most the expensive diet in the world, unless you're living on heroin.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nAny general information on the food keeping longer, so that economically it's more efficient.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, just remember food on this side diet goes bad?\n\n The rottener that it is the more that it is predigested, no problem.\n\n Our good friend here just brought us some century eggs, bacteria deteriorated eggs.\n\n That probably was a year old cause it was as firm as a hard boiled egg in parts of it.\n\n There were green molds in there.\n\n There was gangrene in there.\n\n\r\nThere's all kinds of good bacteria.\n\n It was quite tasty wasn't it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt was like a gummy bear?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, your dairy never goes bad, it just becomes cheese, dryer and dryer cheese.\n\n It does not go bad, if you want things to stay fresh you put them in glass jars.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Hyperbolic Chamber Bad \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nPeople who are not on a good diet\n\n For people that I've seen on a good diet using hyperbolic chambers, it is not favorable.\n\n It will cause problems.\n\n\r\nThe I would have to guess at.\n\n I haven't funded any more research because I've already spent a million dollars, and I became a slave to the research.\n\n \r\nLike I said, it's not necessary, I just watch what happens.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Hypothyroid \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHypothyroid means low thyroid activity\n\n It depends on what the thyroid condition is.\n\n If you're a person who's very toxic and the body does not want the thyroid to be active and the thyroid is perfectly healthy, there's nothing you can do about it.\n\n Cause your body does not want your thyroid to produce more.\n\n\r\nThyroxin same with the adrenal.\n\n Same with any of those glands.\n\n Many times.\n\n In fact, 60% of the time I find that low thyroid or low any glandular activity is because the body doesn't want you to spend the energy on activity.\n\n It wants you to spend it on healing and detoxification.\n\n And so I cannot make a blanket statement about what is good drive for a hypothyroid in that context.\n\n \r\nIf you truly have a damaged thyroid with toxicity in it, it's not functioning well, and you need to get it functioning a little bit better.\n\n As I said in the first book, take a little vanilla extract, it will help.\n\n eating thyroid glands is great.\n\n James Stewart, is he here.\n\n James Stewart carries Buffalo glands?\n\n\r\nYou know, you've got low testosterone and you wanna kick your pecker up, you know, eat the testes.\n\n They're about this big and they're so sweet and delicious, and then they have other glands, thymus, liver, thyroid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you prepare it.\n\n Do you blend it with honey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you should just eat that?\n\n Buffalo has a thyroid about as big as your thumb, yet a calf has a thyroid two to three pounds.\n\n \r\nYou say, well, a thyroid is so important.\n\n\r\nHow important is a thyroid for a Buffalo.\n\n It's the size of your thumb, and you're talking about an animal that is 2000, 3000 pounds?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much should I eat then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Well, as I said in my book, I said when I had a low thyroid activity from the chemotherapy and the thyroid was damaged?\n\n I had it three months after I'd had it the first time.\n\n The next time it was almost six months before I had hypothyroid activity or symptoms.\n\n\r\nAnd then after that, it was a year, 12 months.\n\n And after I hadn't had any symptoms of low thyroid.\n\n\r\nIf you're eating the gland, you will repair the area if you're eating a good diet along with it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Magic Mushrooms & Marijuana Novacane \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIn 1978, I had 16 fillings that were half mercury, the amalgams\n\n There happened to be a dentist Jim Rota in Westwood.\n\n Very, very famous dentist.\n\n He drilled all of them out and did far more than I understood at the time that I wouldn't have let him do all that, but he just did my whole mouth.\n\n \r\nTook all my amalgams out of there.\n\n I had four hours of drilling one morning, four hours of drilling the next morning with no Novocain, no nothing.\n\n However, what I did do was I took a little magic mushroom, and I took just about a quarter of a teaspoon of it.\n\n Now let that dissolve, and sit in my mouth for about an hour, and it releases some pain relievers.\n\n \r\nSo, it was very nice.\n\n You can do it with marijuana too, but the THC causes some people to be paranoid.\n\n So, if marijuana makes you paranoid, don't use marijuana.\n\n \r\nIn its raw state it most often won't do that.\n\n Chew it and chew it.\n\n Remember you've got ptyalin enzyme inside of the mouth, that breaks down the cellulose and the sugars, and that releases the THC.\n\n \r\nWhen you swallow it, you're not gonna get much from it.\n\n So, it has to be in the mouth.\n\n The saliva will eventually break it down.\n\n But if you have a tendency toward paranoia, low blood pressure from marijuana, do not use that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Menopause and Vaginal Drynes \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSince menopause, I've had a lot of vaginal dryness\n\n Do you have recommendations.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou know, I've always wondered what does menopause mean?\n\n That's such a funny word?\n\n You've had a lot of dryness.\n\n Like I said, in the first book, menopause is not the cessation normally in healthy people.\n\n It's not the cessation of hormonal production.\n\n\r\nBut because we're on such bad diets, and we poisoned the system when the body tries to make the change over, it can't do it.\n\n So, in trying to make the change over, it gets exhausted, and then it stops creating the hormones.\n\n That's only because you're not getting the right fats and proteins together.\n\n So, anytime you wanna make sure that you're generating hormones, you have to eat butter or eggs with meat.\n\n\r\nCream doesn't quite do it except for made the pituitary gland and made the pineal.\n\n But for all the other glands, it takes butter or egg with meat to generate hormones.\n\n.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCan you use the lube formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n That's better.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Mix Clay With Coconut Cream Or Butter For Teeth \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nIt doesn't matter\n\n It won't ferment no matter what you do with it.\n\n It can take a week if you don't put lime juice in it, but you know, it smells kinda ripe.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nClay, which clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTerramin clay, green clay, coral calcium?\n\n \r\nThat's a little too rough.\n\n There are stones in there that merge, scratch your enamel.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYou can take the green clay, and you put water in it or what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mix it with coconut cream, or you do it with butter?\n\n It's like when the jewelers use a clay, which is a very fine sanding substance.\n\n They mix it with an oil.\n\n That's what jewelers use, it polishes stones without scratching the surface.\n\n If you use just clay alone or an abrasive substance alone, you will file.\n\n It will sand down the enamel, which you don't want.\n\n So, if you put with some kind of an oil or fat, then it won't do that.\n\n \r\nIt will just Polish them.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOnce every six months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDo it once a week, if you want?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about going to a dentist and having your teeth cleaned.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen they go in and scrape, that damages the dentine, also damages your gums?\n\n It also causes the pockets to deepen.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Natural Birth Control \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNatural forms of birth control\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUm, what do you wanna know it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat do I want to know?\n\n Yeah?\n\n Uh, how to keep.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh *Laughs* \r\nAs I said in my first book, it was a doctor, forgot his name.\n\n He followed- it was 237 couples over a five-year period, and these were all couples that wanted to get pregnant and have a child.\n\n \r\nHe did blood tests.\n\n He did urine tests.\n\n He did everything, he followed them frequently.\n\n He found that the stand open window for pregnancy occurs five days before ovulation.\n\n On the day of ovulation, it's too late.\n\n And most people use that last day of ovulation as their pinpoint, too late.\n\n And he says, if you want to avoid getting pregnant, then if the sperm can live three days on the average person on the average diet.\n\n \r\nOn the sad diet, standard American diet.\n\n It's a sad diet.\n\n Your sperm will live three *days*.\n\n However, on this diet, the sperm can live five days, a little healthier.\n\n So, what you do is you count back, you've got five days before ovulation, then another five days that they can live.\n\n So in the book, I said 10 days before ovulation do not ejaculate inside your partner.\n\n \r\nAnd it's always the men's responsibility because it's their sperm.\n\n It's not the women's responsibility.\n\n You're shooting it in her.\n\n She would not get pregnant without your sperm.\n\n And let me tell you, you've been around your woman.\n\n She gets emotional.\n\n She forgets time, space.\n\n Forget it.\n\n You've got to keep it.\n\n I mean, when I'm with a lady.\n\n \r\nI mark down the days that she ovulates the day that she has her period, I mark it all and I keep track of it, and I'm on her ass like a hip pocket.\n\n So, I don't impregnate her, and it's that simple.\n\n 10 days before ovulation, you do not ejaculate inside.\n\n You pull on her stomach wherever she wants it, or the towel if she doesn't want it on her.\n\n \r\nBut you've got to learn to be in control and pull, and it can't be that, \"Oh, I can just make that first squirt\".\n\n You pull out, don't take that chance.\n\n Those things shoot that first squirt is the, is the one that really propels, and if it gets right up there around that cervix man, they'll swim in quickly, especially on this diet.\n\n \r\nSo, you have got to be careful.\n\n Men, it is your responsibility.\n\n You count, and you keep track of it and you be responsible.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIsn't there something like pre cum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI've had pre cum analyzed 62 times, and never is there a live sperm in it?\n\n That is like a soap.\n\n It's a solvent.\n\n It has urine in it.\n\n It has a lot of other properties in it, but no live swimmable sperm.\n\n  \r\nNot one of those sperm in the right environment could swim a quarter of an inch.\n\n \r\nSo, you don't have to worry about that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Old Chinese Medicine Doesn't Work \n \n \n \n \n### (33) People Used To Use Coconut Oil As Soap \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBaths, and showers worse\n\n People are worse off.\n\n They have more skin disease; we have more psoriasis.\n\n We have more skin problems because we rely upon chemical soaps, mostly petroleum products to clean the skin.\n\n Now, 50 years ago, when I was seven years old, 90% of the soap products, even dish, soap was made of coconut oils.\n\n  \r\nA natural substance, too expensive to grow the coconuts, to have them picked from the palms and then process, and then Shipp from other countries to here.\n\n  \r\nIt's much easier to take a petroleum product and make an acetate out of it.\n\n Not a natural acetate out of it as a solid to dissolve toxicity or dirt.\n\n  \r\nSo, what happens.\n\n We're poisoning our skin every time we clean ourselves, you try to give an animal a bath and they will freak out?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Porcelaine Teeth \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWould you tell him what to use or would I advise to him, just say porcelain\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n You tell him that you're one of my clients om my diet.\n\n \r\nWell, you tell him porcelain.\n\n He is a dentist that recommends the normal stuff.\n\n Mm-hmm  you tell you want an inlay or if it's a cap that you're putting over it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat do you mean about dried marijuana.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDried takes longer, fresh is best?\n\n Uses the fats a little bit quicker.\n\n Don't swallow it, just keep chewing cause the THC gets absorbed in the mouth into the brain directly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Pottengers Study \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nJust like Pottenger's, and Howell's study with the cats, and the rats\n\n You put 'em on a cooked diet, and after five generations, they become extinct.\n\n  \r\nAfter three generations, they get serious diseases.\n\n Every disease that man has.\n\n Before that, if they're raised on the natural diet, they have no disease, none whatsoever, not even dental caries.\n\n \r\nThe first dental carry discovered in the Eskimos was in 1886, and that was among an Eskimo who had ate the German and British diet of cakes and pastries for 50 years.\n\n  \r\nFirst case of cancer among the Eskimos was 1936, again in a person who had lived in the German, and British colonies.\n\n Eating the breads, and the regular cakes and the other garbage.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Propgoanda and Don't Eat Meat  &Athletes Burn Out \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, the people had to follow a certain diet\n\n Our government does it and our industry does it by slamming you with propaganda.\n\n Don't eat much meat, eat high carbohydrate diets, and you've got that coming from every field everywhere.\n\n And the TV's hitting you with all these eat potato chips, eats all this sweet stuff, all these cereals, that's the breakfast of champions.\n\n \r\nWhat champions.\n\n I don't know?\n\n These athletes who go out there and make millions of dollars by saying it gives them energy, and then they burn out at 32 - 36 years old.\n\n And then you wonder, wait, we've got men in Georgia, Russia, which are going out in the fields at 146 years old, still attending the field, riding horses.\n\n \r\nWhy are our of athletes burning out in their thirties.\n\n And in the Andes, we have 90-year-old men that are running the 200-mile ball tip in the Andes mountains?\n\n Every year, they do it once a year.\n\n Can you imagine running 200 miles kicking a ball at 90 years old.\n\n  \r\nAnd our athletes can't do it at 35, 37 years old?\n\n There's a real propaganda, garbage information that's going out there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, guys in the Andes eat raw meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, they eat raw bugs?\n\n Worms, and caterpillars in Chile, in the Andes, Peru.\n\n  \r\nOne of my good friends, Naomi from Peru.\n\n She would go pick out eggshells.\n\n They were so poor they'd go pick out eggshells and lick the egg white out of eggshells.\n\n  \r\nAnd they eat worms, they eat insects, anything.\n\n \r\nAnd she was healthy and strong, and that's what she lived on.\n\n \r\nAnd these people are incredibly vigorous by eating stuff like that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Reverse Teeth Decay \n \n \n \n \n### (38) Root Canal & Go To Mexico For Dental Procedure \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYeah, I had a cavity not long ago, and a doctor wanted to do a root canal, and put a temporary in, and now it's starting to crumble, and you said, wait till it falls out and then put porcelain in\n\n  \r\nHow did I know when it's sufficiently out to put the porcelain in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen it's disintegrated, and there's space behind that filling, just go ahead and have it done?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay, and what if my dentist wanted to do a root canal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf the nerve is dead, you do a root canal?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou said it wasn't because there was pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nRight, if there's pain, and there's bleeding.\n\n I had a tooth here; this tooth was broken.\n\n My father hit me with a paint can when I was 16 years old, broke these two teeth off to the gum.\n\n And my older brother was holding me he did it.\n\n \r\nSo, I was livid, and my blood was shooting out my head cause my father had hit me with a nine iron first, nine iron golf club and went into my skull.\n\n Blood was shooting out here.\n\n My brother's holding me back cause I had gotten my father by the throat, and I was choking him to death, and I was not really with it after that.\n\n \r\nThe golf club hit my brain.\n\n So, I was choking him when my older brother comes in, and he had just come back from Vietnam, and he was undercover CIA type army intelligence.\n\n So, he had been trained to kill, so he had me in a lock so quickly, and my father picked up a pain can *wham*.\n\n Spray paint can hit me, knocked these teeth out.\n\n \r\nWell, the doctor many times wanted to root canals, and I said, if I have feeling there the roots alive, why would I want you to kill that tooth.\n\n He said, \"Well, because it could get infected\"?\n\n I said, if a frog had weeds, he wouldn't bump his ass when he jumped.\n\n I wait until the tooth dies before I'm gonna have you destroy that tooth because you can add to it.\n\n \r\nSo, I had a cap put on with a short post in it, cause there was no way I was gonna let him do a root canal, that is illegal to do in this country.\n\n So, I had to go to Mexico to do it, and still this tooth up until five years ago was still alive.\n\n \r\nThe cap finally came off after 25 years and he said, I wanna do a root canal on it.\n\n \r\nI said, the tooth is still alive.\n\n I can feel it.\n\n So, he said, I don't think so.\n\n So he probes up in there and it bled.\n\n He said, \"Yeah, it's alive\".\n\n I said, \"Then you're not doing a root canal\".\n\n So, that was that.\n\n So, he didn't do a root canal.\n\n He was an American doctor who would do anything that I said, but he retired.\n\n So, now I have to go to Mexico to have it done.\n\n \r\nAnything done that I want done cause I will not cause damage to my mouth because of a fever of possibilities.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo you have to go very far in New Mexico.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, just in the Tiwan, and the dentist I use is Dr?\n\n Briton, Thomas Briton, B R I T T O N.\n\n Third generation dentist, and he's very gentle.\n\n He's a big bear of a man.\n\n Very gentle, speaks English.\n\n His father speaks perfect American, but his mother and his father, were dentists.\n\n He's a dentist.\n\n He's gentle.\n\n He'll do anything I say, I got him into the more natural dental practice, and he's a heavy researcher.\n\n \r\nI mean, he will just go right into it.\n\n He grew up with it.\n\n So, he's aware already of the complexity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, my dentist just like insists that the tooth is dead.\n\n So if I went and had a second opinion, would he tell me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, he would tell you if it's alive or not?\n\n You just say, is it bleeding.\n\n You stick it up there, and is there any pain up there?\n\n \r\nYou'll put a prong up there and see, and if it isn't, he won't do it to you?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Salmonella Eats Dead Cells On Skin \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNaturally we have 2,300 varieties of salmonella that eat those dead cells up\n\n That's the natural process.\n\n \r\nSure, we all stunk, but we got used to that stink.\n\n It was natural.\n\n Now we're so far away from it.\n\n We expect to smell these awful, vaporized oils that cause damage to the lungs and the sinuses and the eyes and the brain as now a helpful clean response and it isn't, it is highly toxic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Salt Water Rips The Fat Out Of Skin \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhy did you say if you're not in salt water\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf I'm in salt water, it rips the fat out of my skin?\n\n So I will burn.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n snorkeling.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, if you're in salt water, then you shouldn't sun as much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, correct.\n\n Cause the salt will just eat the fat away.\n\n Deteriorate the fat.\n\n I was, on Phuket Island, and Phi Phi island, 14 days before the tsunami hit.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, completely demolished.\n\n Everybody died in that in that hotel.\n\n \r\nSo, I just made it out in time, but I was out in that bay snorkeling the day before I left, and I snorkeled in four different places by going on this boat trip, and by the time the day was ending, I was so burned that I didn't know it till the end of the day.\n\n I mean my skin fell like leather, so I put the egg white on it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Scolliosis = Hot Baths  &Hardening Of The Arteries \n \n**[2005],[Clay]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI was a researcher on scoliosis, and how do we handle that\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nScoliosis is an unnatural curvature, natural in a disease state curvature of the spine?\n\n  \r\nThat can happen from toxicity lodging in the muscles around on one side of the spine or in the front or back causing the spine to move in a unnatural way or an uneven an unbalanced way, or it can be toxin stored in the vertebrates that cause things like arthritis in the joints that can eat away the cartilage.\n\n  \r\nSo, then you have an imbalance.\n\n Any of those will create different curvatures on the spine, too many minerals.\n\n Let's say somebody eats a lot of pasteurized dairy products and they may get excess mineral deposits stored in the joints and they create little spurs and they can cut the spinal cord and they can cause the body to tense up in a certain way and cause curvature of the spine.\n\n \r\nSo, there are many reasons it can happen.\n\n So, it depends upon what is the particular problem to how to reverse it, and that's a whole science in itself, but the curvature of the spine is always a lack of nutrients, or an excess toxicity stored in the spinal cord.\n\n  \r\nYou want to relax it and get that spine to straighten as much as possible, hot baths are very important and you need to stay in a hot bath for many hours.\n\n Most people of this generation, my generation up grew up on margarine, vegetables oils.\n\n That's what causes hardening of the arteries and heart conditions.\n\n The natives, all of the tribes that eat ugly meats and animal products, even though they cook them, they have no heart disease and no hardening of any arteries.\n\n \r\nThey have no varicose veins, no thrombosis, none.\n\n So, it's all propagated, it's absolute bull malarkey.\n\n There's propaganda out there about meat products, that animal fats cause heart conditions.\n\n It's absolute nonsense.\n\n If you take vegetable fats and you let them sit, guess what they turn into, crystals.\n\n \r\nAnd then they turn into rock.\n\n Vegetable fat are your problem.\n\n That's what causes hardening of the arteries.\n\n Hardening of the heart, MS.\n\n \r\nDo you know what an Amber Stone is.\n\n Does anybody have any jewelry with Amber orange stone?\n\n Guess what that was, that was out of the tree?\n\n Most of your crystals and stones are from vegetable fat.\n\n If you take vegetable oils and you put with dirt, and let it sit for a year, you will have rock.\n\n You turn that soil into rock, and you have to pound the hell out of, and you have to mix all kinds of molds in it to break it down, does not break down easily.\n\n  \r\nIf you take animal fats and put it with dirt, it'll just keep molding until it becomes earth.\n\n A lot of back problems start in young age, scoliosis because of all these toxic vegetable oils that are in everything.\n\n \r\nThe chips, the French fries, the Kentucky fried chicken, donuts fried in vegetable oils.\n\n That is causing hardening of the arteries, and the phenomenally advanced increase in heart disease.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Skin Healing \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd you mean from the cesarean\n\n Oh, that's eating a good diet, balanced diet all the way around because you've got to replace the lymphatic networks?\n\n You've gotta unblock all of the scarring.\n\n You have to regenerate new passages for blood, lymph and neurological systems.\n\n\r\nAnd it's not gonna happen very easily unless you're eating raw meat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Sun  & Aging - Keeps You Younger With Fat \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHave you written about son and aging\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, sun and aging again, is if you don't have the fats on the skin, you're going to age?\n\n \r\nOtherwise the sun causes you to stay younger, cuz it helps you your cellular division.\n\n\r\nNow, when I lived outdoors on a bicycle from December 31st, 1973, all the way through \r\nOctober 76, my skin was just like you saw pictures of Indians.\n\n I mean, it was like leather \r\ncause I lived on a bicycle.\n\n I lived outdoors for that three years and my skin was thickened \r\nlike leather.\n\n\r\nIt's no longer like that, and I still go out and get lots of sun, just doesn't happen with \r\nthe good raw fats in the body.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Sun Is Very Important & How Much \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, that depends\n\n Black people, dark people, Asians all over the world.\n\n They're dark because they keep absorbing the sun and it's just like the black people in their health.\n\n They're the greatest sports people in the world cause they've only been eating cooked foods for 400 years since we shipped them over here.\n\n \r\nThey eat raw, raw meats and raw everything.\n\n The fat in the skin determines whether you use the sun's rays properly and the sun will transform fats into vitamin D and other lipids and cholesterol.\n\n Then nutrify the body, and help bones grow and tissue regenerate, cells divide.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n \r\nSo, most people who are very fair skinned.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, that shows very unhealthy skin when you were young.\n\n It takes more time to regenerate that tissue, but I found in the last year doing experiments if you start putting meat slices on your face at night.\n\n The skin actually starts revitalizing.\n\n \r\nSo, that's what you can do to wake it up, so you can handle the sun better.\n\n However, you still have pore absorption of the fats, so he still may have to be able to be out in the sun for a couple of hours, beyond that he may need covered.\n\n  \r\nIt's like I can go outside, and I can be out in the sun as long as I'm not in the salt water I can be out there every day for 10, 12 hours a day in the bright sun.\n\n And I'll turn black, and I mean black and with these blue eyes it becomes like Kimberly, but when my skin goes black and when I was a kid, if I looked at the sun, I burned.\n\n I mean, if I were out there 10 minutes, I'd blister, but it isn't that way now that I'm on this diet, but it takes a while to get there.\n\n  \r\nIf you're very young, you're under 20.\n\n It only takes 10 days of being on the butter to be able to absorb the sun properly.\n\n I even had an albino.\n\n Ate butter and lots of avocados and eat proper foods to be able to utilize the sun's rays properly, and the first time he went out, he fell asleep, was out there six hours and not burned.\n\n \r\nBut he was only 19 years old.\n\n You know, as you get older, it takes the skin a longer time to regenerate, we don't have the growth hormones that we do till we're 21.\n\n So.\n\n after that takes longer, so like I said, in the book, you keep flipping sides if you're sunning.\n\n If you're out there doing some kind of sport, you better wear a long-sleeved shirt if you start feeling too hot.\n\n \r\nIf you burn, you can prevent yourself from blistering just by putting egg white on there, or the formulas I've given for burn.\n\n In the revision I'm splitting those up.\n\n I'm putting burn separate from sunburn.\n\n So, there won't be any mistake about it.\n\n \r\nThe primal facial body care cream, new one in the recipe book is great also for getting rid of burn and also helping you prevent burn, and also causing you to tan.\n\n Now, if you wanna get white, there's a lot of Asian girls that you're not considered elite and of the.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Trembling From Elbow Parkinsons \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes, I do?\n\n I thank you.\n\n Um, I have a tremble, which seems to occur from my elbow , and it tends to come with tension.\n\n I get tense, I can feel this vibrate.\n\n I relax the vibration.\n\n See.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n He says he has trembling from his arm, the elbow, down to his hand, and when he gets tense, it's more prominent at that time.\n\n He notices it at that time.\n\n \r\nAlmost all palsy, almost all Parkinson's.\n\n Almost all those diseases are coming from aluminum, the Zeta principle.\n\n So, then the electromagnetic energy that's normally supposed to pass through the system gets caught up where the aluminum is stuck and all of the impulses start stuttery.\n\n \r\nSay I took a wire out of the plug there and put it against that metal shovel, and all of a sudden you see the sparks going every which way.\n\n It's no longer hit a natural conductor.\n\n So when somebody plugs it in ,that's the normal passage of electromagnetic energy that goes down into the rest of the fingers or down to the fingers.\n\n If it's short circuited by this aluminum, other metals can do it, but it's mainly aluminum.\n\n\r\nSo, if you've got aluminum there.\n\n It's gonna block everything up.\n\n That's why Parkinson's, Alzheimer's is also memory block of the particular impulses going from the ganglia or the axons or the synapse firing correctly because you've got this metal toxic metal, especially aluminum stuck there, short circuiting everything.\n\n\r\nSo, it's a matter of getting aluminum out of the body.\n\n Things that I found to get rid of aluminum.\n\n The only thing I found to get rid of aluminum is raspberries.\n\n Raspberries, and coconut cream , and it's mixed with butter and cow cream.\n\n All three creams together.\n\n Coconut cream is the most important and always have them in the afternoon or else you might not sleep at night.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Vaginal Herpes C-Section & Viruses Are Soaps \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMy two kids were cesarean cause my wife claimed to have vaginal herpes and was concerned aobut passing the babies through\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd that's such an absurdity.\n\n Think about this people.\n\n Virus are not alive.\n\n If you pick up any biochemistry book, virus are protein bodies with RNA attached and sometimes the DNA.\n\n \r\nBut they are never alive.\n\n If you put them in a fertilized petri dish, they don't self-replicate, not one.\n\n And you spike it with virus, not one will reproduce.\n\n You don't have not one more virus, then you inject it, but you spiked into that patient.\n\n  \r\nAs soon as you introduce healthy animal cells into that environment, which can breathe in that dish, all of a sudden, they start multiplying.\n\n That's because cells manufacture virus, they are not contagious, and virus are nothing other than soaps.\n\n We make soaps, let's say I mixed coconut cream and egg together.\n\n That's a natural soap.\n\n Virus are soap they're protein bodies that help dissolve certain kinds of tissue.\n\n The tissue that it dissolves is determined by the RNA that the cell puts in that chain.\n\n \r\nSo, it only dissolves a particular cell or part of a cell or a kind of a cell, a damaged cell, an unhealthy cell.\n\n The whole belief that somebody's gonna get a virus from somebody else is a Hollywood type mis-story that the pharmaceutical industry gets you to buy, so you'll take their drugs and their vaccines.\n\n Nothing to do with reality or chemistry.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Viruses Can Be Injected Into You \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nCan disintegrate the body\n\n It's a solvent, it's like putting a solvent in your body, like a uric acid, a muriatic acid.\n\n Muriatic acid is gonna dissolve your body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut it can't be transferred by blood.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n  \r\nIt can be injected in you.\n\n  \r\nIf you take blood from me and I have it and put it in you, you're gonna have it, but they will not replicate.\n\n \r\nThey do not self-replicate.\n\n They have a tendency to magnetize or chelate with mercury and aluminum and a lot of other metals that don't easily discharge from the body.\n\n So, you will keep them in the body and they'll keep dissolving tissue in your body and break it down if you can't eliminate those metals that they're attached to.\n\n \r\nAnd that's how they work, but they do not replicate.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIf you don't have replication, how do you account for the disease transmission.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere is no disease transmission, unless it's injected in you?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWell, like where you have, um, where you have aids.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

cause the body to choke itself, to not allow oxygen through the skin, so they can be used medicinally.\n\n And they're mainly solvents for cleaning the body.\n\n The body will use some alcohol with them to make soaps, to clean the body.\n\n \r\nSo, it's good to use it only medicinally.\n\n One tablespoon of one of those a day, or if you're gonna use it for like a meat sauce or you're gonna have a lot of olive oil in a sauce, to have 4 to 5 tablespoons of sauce that you use 'em to two meat meals that day, then don't have anything three or four days or five days, more oils again.\n\n \r\nSo, oils are very concentrated, so you have to be careful.\n\n Butter is not, you can use a couple sticks a day.\n\n All the animal fats are fine.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Detox & Hit By Crowbar \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFirst, I'm gonna talk about it if everybody sees, I'm a little swollen over here and sagging\n\n Friday night, I started going into a heavy detoxification.\n\n I was in Bangkok three years ago in December and I was hit with a crowbar here.\n\n They were trying to get my movie camera and they knocked the bone that connected from here to here.\n\n All the way back under my tongue.\n\n  \r\nSo, it took an hour of surgery to pull it back, to wire my jaw, and to wire the teeth back in, they wanted to just cut the bone out.\n\n They said it will never heal.\n\n The tube of nerves that went to the teeth was severed in two places, and they say that will never reconnect the tooth.\n\n The tooth and the, and the bone will rot and it'll kill you because it can go to the brain.\n\n \r\nI said, you don't know me and you don't know my diet.\n\n So, if it goes into necrosis, I will have it removed after so many weeks.\n\n So, they put it back in place and my teeth are there, and the bones solid.\n\n But I accepted Novocain, which is something I don’t do and I accepted it because the pain was so excruciating cause I had to pull the bone all the way from under my tongue and pull it back and work it back in because they had stretched it out of place.\n\n So, pulling the jaw apart and putting the bone in was pretty painful, so I allowed them to give me six shots of Novocain.\n\n So, the Novocain lodged here in the bone and it started popping out on Friday.\n\n \r\nSo, Saturday, this thing was this big, and it's already gone down to this.\n\n Now, when I had Novocain in the past, you know, pre-1972, the Novocain, when it would come out, I'd have a detox like this last sometimes for two weeks.\n\n 21 days, three weeks.\n\n So, this is very quick.\n\n \r\nIt was very painful for one day, but I was able- I saw patients yesterday, did a lot of work yesterday, so I'm getting healthier and healthier and healthier, even though I'm turning 60 in two months.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Flying Schedule \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\n \r\nComing back in April\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no?\n\n I have to fly from Asia to Hawaii on the 27th cause I'm doing a workshop.\n\n I'm seeing patients in Hawaii.\n\n So, I'll be back the 1st or 2nd of May.\n\n And then I'm only back for two days.\n\n Then I go to Omaha back for two days, then I go to St.\n\n Louis back for two days, go to Chicago back for two days, go to Phoenix back for four days.\n\n Then go to Washington DC for two and a half months, which I'm not gonna be around much.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen you go to Phoenix, are you doing like lectures and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI do a lecture and see patients?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWould that be on your website.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nHe's gonna have it up there?\n\n I publish everything two months before the event.\n\n I'm gonna send you a list of everything ahead of time.\n\n Because I don't like to send them out to everybody else until two months ahead.\n\n \r\nI found if I do it more than two months, they can lose everything.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, you’re gonna be gone for almost- \r\n\n \r\nFive and a half months.\n\n When I get back from Washington, DC, I have to go to Cincinnati to do a lecture workshop there, and then I go to Aspen and then I'll be back the end of August.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, we get to fly Aspen in Phoenix and Washington DC, just to listen to you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely?\n\n I do have people who do that.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nAre you gonna be able to edit the footage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI hope to get most of it pre-edited all in there?\n\n \r\nWhile I'm here, I don't have any time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, a quick question.\n\n I know as you do consulting services, can you give us a rundown, like how you do it or what you do or what's recommended.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nIt's on the site?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, what I do is I photograph the irises, and that tells me what's in the body, and I look at the hands to see how the glands are working, how much congestion there is compared to what's in the eye.\n\n \r\nIt's like a two-analysis viewpoint, and then I give people a diet that.\n\n Takes about an hour and 15 minutes.\n\n The first time it is $300 and I like to see people once a year, just so they can see how they've done and the changes in the eyes.\n\n So, I pull them up there together and they get to see the changes, like this couple.\n\n \r\nI'm talking about the couple that left early.\n\n They drove down, it was 18 months since they had a reading and the changes in their eyes were extraordinary.\n\n Especially in hers cause she does the diet 90%, he does it 60%.\n\n So, and you can see the difference in what he did and what she did.\n\n \r\nShe was overall healing and cleansing.\n\n He was overall mainly cleansing.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Aajonus Hobby Was Cooking \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nAnd that's what I used to do before I got into raw foods\n\n As a matter fact, of that was my hobby, cooking.\n\n Bt then when I got into raw foods, everything was so tasty compared because when you cook a food, it destroys the taste buds in it, everything that was alive, it breaks it down and goes flat.\n\n \r\nThat’s why they add all this salt and all flavorings to everything because once you process and cook the food it's cardboard, tastes like cardboard, there's no flavor.\n\n So, of course they have to flavor it to get you to eat it.\n\n So, I eat just straight.\n\n The only thing I really don't like, and don't like to eat alone without some kind of spice with it is kidney because of the ammonia.\n\n \r\nI hate the taste of ammonia.\n\n It just tastes terrible, kidney tastes terrible to me.\n\n So, I'll either blend it with a lot of other glandsand those glands are very good.\n\n When I was in Nevada city, I had a friend who shot a deer.\n\n I butchered it, so I took the brain and I took all the glands and everything and made a big gland shake with all this mixture.\n\n I had done a workshop and two days of consults all the way from the morning, eight o'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock at night, and then a few that day, and I was supposed to get some rest, take a nap and go pick up my girlfriend at Reno airport.\n\n \r\nSo, that was about an hour and a half, two-hour drive, and it was gonna be in the evening at night and because he shot this deer, I had to butcher it because nobody else knew how to skin and butcher a deer or any animal.\n\n None of these people had seen a farm, much less know what to do.\n\n So, \r\n I butchered this deer and put all the glands in, so I didn't get my nap because I spent three hours skinning and butchering this whole deer and including getting the brain out, which is still pretty fast because your average person wouldn't know how to do.\n\n Could take 6 to 12 hours to do it, and I did in three hours.\n\n \r\nOf course I butchered a lot, so I just knew how to go through it, all the parts, butchered  the steaks and everything.\n\n Had the entire thing butchered in three hours, every piece of it, every section.\n\n So, made that glandular shake.\n\n So, I had about a cup and a half the glandular shake.\n\n I got so high.\n\n Got to the Reno airport, picked up my girlfriend, didn't get to the hotel light till like two o'clock in the morning, and we had sex for three hours and I still didn't wanna go to sleep, but she was really tired.\n\n  So, that's what that kind of shake can do for you, really drive the energy up.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Advacnes Glycation End Products \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nJust one more aspect of the question regarding thirst and vegetable juice\n\n If like carbo vegetables, like carrot, beet, or other root vegetables, do they have destructive factor of advanced glycation end products if I have too much vegetable juice or is that mostly due to bread.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nVegetable juice, anything that's high in carbohydrates, even fruit, fresh fruit?\n\n Anything that has a high glycemic level, anything that is high in carbohydrates.\n\n Your body will convert so much of that into glycogen, which runs the brain and nervous system.\n\n The end process of the body using glycogen is advanced glycation end products and your body stores 70% to 90% of that for a lifetime.\n\n  \r\nSo, when you drink carrot juice, beet juice.\n\n Any of those high glycemic vegetables, it creates the advanced glycation end products.\n\n The only way you can avoid that- mainly in my vegetable juices that I suggest in the book, it's mainly celery.\n\n There's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery, so it's a negative.\n\n  \r\nSo, you put a little carrot in there.\n\n You put the high glycemic parsley n there, it comes to an even balance.\n\n So, there's no excessive carbohydrate, so your body can never make it into glycogen to fuel the brain and nervous system.\n\n When your body uses meat or eggs to form glycogen, it does it with a help of glucagon and there's a very low carbohydrate index like 8% and we can handle about 12% at a time.\n\n  \r\nSo, it doesn't store any of the advanced glycation end products, what little it does make from eggs and meat.\n\n That's why I say you need to not eat high carbohydrate foods in any concentration before six hours passed, for first six, seven hours of the day.\n\n \r\nBecause the body has made all the glycogen for the day in that first six to seven hours.\n\n So, you have a vegetable juice, that's a negative or an even, you're not gonna generate any from it.\n\n Then you go to a meat meal, which doesn't have any in it, except if you are using a little honey and only 10% of the honey, as long as it's unheated above 93 degrees, then only use 10% of that honey will be high in carbohydrate.\n\n And most of that will go to be utilized in digesting the fat and not into making glycogen.\n\n Then you go from that to a milkshake and you've got enough cream and fats in there, so the sugars and carbohydrates will be used to digest the fat rather than to make glycogen.\n\n \r\nSo, then after that you have another juice.\n\n So, you're not having anything with high fruit on it until 1:30 PM, 4:30 PM, somewhere between that area.\n\n So, you haven't allowed your body to make glycogen from high carbohydrate foods and your brain will stay clear and functional.\n\n \r\nIf you have those advanced glycation end products in any concentration, it causes the neurological fluid and the blood to get very sticky.\n\n And if you see them going, passing each other, the blood cells, there's so many of them, they’re just like swimming together or moving together in this current of blood, and you see them stick together when the blood's like tha.\n\n And the brain and the  nerve fluid, it's the same way.\n\n And you get synapse that fire and the fluid sticks and may go to the wrong brain center than where you've directed it.\n\n Oh, I want this memory.\n\n Well, it shoots off into the wrong memory station and all of a sudden you don't know where that went.\n\n \r\nYou don't have the word or the phrase or the memory, the event that you were looking for, and it's not there because the brain's too sticky.\n\n So, that prevents that by eating that progression.\n\n So, yes, if you had all carrot juice in the morning, you'd be screwing your thinking process.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Amish Foods and Whols Foods \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat's the best source to get the raw cheese, eggs here in town?\n\n Which stores?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mean in the valley?\n\n \tNone?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhere do you get your stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI go over to our Rawsome club in Venice and James has an Amish truck that comes from Pennsylvania, an Amish group of farmers that supply us?\n\n There are about seven farmers and Amos Miller is the one that handles organizing, getting all of it for us.\n\n We have a truck that comes out once a week, and delivers to us.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhole foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhole foods is all bullshit, literally?\n\n Whole foods is a company out of Texas, and let me give you an idea of their thinking.\n\n I called them and asked them what they were feeding their all-natural beef, no hormones and no antibiotics.\n\n “Oh, we’re feeding them silage and grain.\n\n” \r\nAnd I said, “What grain.\n\n” And they said, “Mainly wheat”?\n\n And I said, “Okay, what form is the wheat.\n\n Do you crack it?\n\n Do you process it?\n\n What form is it?\n\n” They said, \"Well, we don't know?\n\n” And I'd tell they were lying by that.\n\n And I said, “Okay, who are your producers.\n\n” So, I called their suppliers of beef and found out they were feeding them 15% bakery waste, boiled and oiled donuts, stale donuts?\n\n \r\nSo, I called whole foods back and I said, “You can't call that all natural.\n\n What cows do you know go around eating donuts.\n\n” “Well, the donuts are made of grains of wheat.\n\n” That's their thinking.\n\n And if you look in whole foods, all their advertisements, go organic, go organic.\n\n You look at their produce.\n\n How much produce do they have that’s organic.\n\n 2%?\n\n You go into Wild Oats, 50% or more of their produce is organic.\n\n So, you realize the whole foods is nothing but one of those spin doctor kind of advertising company that we just want you to get to buy the shit at a higher price, and that's all it's about.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, at least they have the milk, the butter, the eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n Well, they will carry some of that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow about the, like a New Zealand line.\n\n That's still good that they sell there, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYep, absolutely?\n\n Yeah.\n\n That's good.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about the Iceland stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIceland is fine, but you have to be careful, often it's frozen from Iceland?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Arnold Shwartzneggar Is Sagging and Aajonus Exercise \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause they've melted everything\n\n You just pumped up with all this mineral toxicity, bloated with all this mineral toxicity.\n\n Once they stopped, that's it.\n\n I mean, look at Arnold Schwarzenegger, anybody see that?\n\n  I saw picture of him.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n Mr.\n\n University, and what he looks like now, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n I mean, you're talking 50 years difference or 40 years difference, and you know, this guy still works out and stuff is just sagging.\n\n I don't work out at all.\n\n I havent' worked out since 1979 and everything is just tight as it can be, and this is my exercise on my computer.\n\n I do carry my groceries once a week.\n\n Carry some milk.\n\n That's it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Arrowhead Water \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[Abraham]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nSince she asked about water, Arrowhead is just not good\n\n If you add apple vinegar to, could you drink yet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI wouldn't drink it?\n\n Just remember that all of Arrowhead water is reclaimed.\n\n See the city of San Bernardino has a contract, indefinite lifetime, 99-year contract for all of the Arrowhead water.\n\n So, Arrowhead reclaims it after the city of San Bernardino uses it.\n\n Full of all the chemicals and everything from the industry, re-bottles them and sells it to you as fresh spring water when it isn't.\n\n**[Abraham]**\n \r\nSo, my question is doesn't the vinegar help neutralize some of those toxins.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt'll help neutralize some of those toxins, but that's for a bath, not to drink?\n\n \r\nI never recommend drinking municipal water anywhere.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Bioeditcal Hormones, Pig Organs \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBioidentical is another misnomer bullshit sales thing\n\n The only way you're gonna get bioidentical is if they take him out of your blood and they give him right back to you, that's the only bio identical.\n\n So again, we've got this chemistry bullshit language that's getting you to believe that you're gonna be getting something that's natural to you.\n\n \r\nThey're taking hormones out of a plant.\n\n Do you have hormones.\n\n Are they identical to a human?\n\n No?\n\n It is absolutely preposterous.\n\n \r\nIf you want something that's closer to the human, you eat glands of an animal, glands of a pig.\n\n Pig and the human are the most alike.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt’s okay to eat pigs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n Oh yes?\n\n As long as you know him.\n\n As long as he is organic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Bioidentical Progresterone \n \n \n \n \n### (11) Blood Clot, Chest Pain, Medical Prosfession \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\n\n \r\nYeah, I know\n\n Whole Foods is purchasing Wild Oats.\n\n I was told last week, you know, so there it goes.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nMy grandfather died from a blood clot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIn the heart, head.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nIn the heart?\n\n**[unlcear]**\n for it to thin it down.\n\n And they sent me off for the prescription and they check on me every once in a while.\n\n I’d go in, I get my blood drawn and they have a scale too thick, too thin or in the middle or whatever.\n\n \r\nAnd a lot of times I come out too thick, even though I'm taking those pills.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou shouldn’t be taking those pills, that's all bullshit.\n\n**[Jim],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I gotta do something about it because-  \r\n\n \r\nNo, you don’t.\n\n You believe their garbage that that was had to do with a heart attack.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nIt's not a heart attack.\n\n It's an embolism.\n\n It's a clot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's no clot in your blood.\n\n Your blood cannot clot because of the diet you're on.\n\n \r\nIt's impossible for it to clot, impossible for it to dry out, impossible.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nHow did I get those chest pains.\n\n I was pretty much on the diet?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou probably had uric acid build up in those muscles.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nNo, they did a scan and they saw the clots and all that stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI would like to see the clots.\n\n I'm telling you there was no clots in there.\n\n \r\nIf you had clots, you would've felt it all the way down the end of your hand.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nThere were sharp pains in the chest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n If you had clots, it would cut the circulation off to your hand.\n\n Your fingers would go instantly numb.\n\n \r\nSo, they were lying to you.\n\n They may have seen congestion, but they weren't clots.\n\n You have to take what the medical profession tells you as their program by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n The pharmaceutical industry has one purpose, that's to get you to take their medication, and that is it.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWith the medicine, they gave you a film and they show you how to take the medicine and to make sure nothing interferes with taking the medicine.\n\n So, when I'm looking at it is I need, I need to reorientate my daily intake so that things don’t cause my proble, steer away from it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat didn't cause your problem, your sick blood didn't cause that problem.\n\n Do you know how thick Aboriginal is.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWell, I mean, something caused a problem?\n\n It was sharp pains, like gunshot pains and my breathing was restricted and I had to do something about it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, pains in your chest will do that.\n\n \r\nIf you have a hharlie horse, do you think you've got a blood clot.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n That's what you were having up here.\n\n \r\nYou were having spasms in your muscles up here.\n\n It's not a heart attack.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nNo, I'm not saying it's a heart attack.\n\n Heart attack is different than a clot heart attacks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut clots cause heart attacks.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWell, I'm worried about it in the brain or something like that, where it kills you right away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n Not going to happen.\n\n They put the average person in fear.\n\n That's the way to put you in fear, and then you take medication.\n\n Your blood thick is a very good thing.\n\n If it's sticky and thick, that's a problem.\n\n But if it's not sticky and thick, you're not gonna have a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow can you tell if it's sticky.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nYeah, I’m not going around cutting myself to see?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you just prick yourself and if it's very sticky after it starts dryying, then that means you're eating too much carbohydrate or you're detoxing too much carbohydrate.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWell, if I cut myself shaving or something, it, it doesn't bleed all over.\n\n \r\nI mean, it's just regulates right away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou don't have a problem.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nSo, shouldn't, I have more juice or eat more grapefruit or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely not?\n\n You got a pain like that.\n\n You drink some raw cream, put a hot water bottle there, make sure the circulation gets through.\n\n Because you've got uric acid built up in the tissues.\n\n That's what causes all spasms, all pains.\n\n  \r\nUnless you have mercury that got free, let's say you had mercury in a muscle or in some fat in some muscle and it got free and it burned.\n\n That's gonna feel like a stabbing pain.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nThere was a swelling in my leg this time and also a couple years before that they say was related to it somehow.\n\n In other words, the clot got to traveling in the circulatory system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's the way they're taught to think.\n\n Look at my swelling here.\n\n Think that’s a blood clot.\n\n I've got a bone situation here from a chemical?\n\n Immediately when this started happening, I tasted the Novocain, and I smelled just like it was after he shot me up with that Novocain cause you can smell Novocain.\n\n You know what it smells like.\n\n That odor came right through my nose once that happened.\n\n  \r\nDon't buy it.\n\n Don't buy their stuff.\n\n You got problem like that, you give me a call.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nWell, I don't wanna die unnecessarily.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15.\n\n5 and 22 before I changed my diet to mainly a raw one, 300 heart attacks.\n\n 50 of them put me unconscious, no medical assistance at any time.\n\n Do you know what the doctor said.\n\n It was all in my head?\n\n You know why.\n\n Because they look for congenital malformation of the heart or congestion?\n\n \r\nIf they don't see those, they don't see anything.\n\n They don't see after an injection, mercury goes in, stores in the heart muscles.\n\n Every time you breathe, every time circulation goes into there, a few of those molecules are released, burn the muscle cells and cause a tightening, a cramping, a charlie horse, right in the heart, painful as can be.\n\n And they said it was in my head because it wasn't congenital.\n\n It wasn't congested.\n\n They never look for the poisons that they put in the body purposefully.\n\n You have to disregard what they say completely.\n\n  \r\nIt's like say you want to become a multimillionaire; do you guy go to the guy on the corner that flips hamburgers to get his suggestions.\n\n \r\nHe'll never tell you how to become a millionaire?\n\n You go to somebody who's good at it.\n\n Donald Trump or somebody like that, or JP Morgan, somebody like that or the Rockefellers, but you certainly don't go to your friendly corner flapjack flipper.\n\n  \r\nAnd that's when you go to the medical profession for health and wellbeing, that's what you're doing.\n\n Because they know nothing about health, they know drugs.\n\n They're legalized drug pushers.\n\n They know diseases, how to identify what they can see, but all this chemistry bullshit is these formulas that have been created by these people who are paid to come up with formulas, to get other people, to get other people, to get those people, to get other people to take medication.\n\n \r\nAnd they don't get paid unless they come up with a formula that says you have to take my medication.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Blood Thinners, High Blood Pressure \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou know what that'll do\n\n That could thin your brain tissue, could thin your veins, and then all of a sudden you have a bleed; you have an aneurysm and that's it?\n\n \r\nRemember all the people with high blood pressure.\n\n They say, “Well, high blood pressure causes aneurysms.\n\n Cause heart attacks.\n\n” Right.\n\n So, they have all this medication for all these years to lower blood pressure?\n\n  \r\nWell, in December, the test from the UK came out from 45,000 people who were tested.\n\n Half of them had high blood pressure was given medication, the other half were not given medication.\n\n ll of the heart attacks occurred in the people who were taking medication, but they didn't say it that way.\n\n What they did was the people who had 110 to 120 diastolic pressure had all the heart attacks.\n\n \r\nThose that had a solid rate of one 160 to one 170 had no heart attacks.\n\n \r\nHigh blood pressure keeps you from having heart attacks.\n\n That's why you have high blood pressure because you have some kind of congestion in your arteries and veins, so you need to expand them, so your blood flows properly.\n\n If you take blood thinners, you thin the walls, then they tear and you've got aneurism.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Cadmium, Kindey Cancer, How Many Minerals To Get Rod If Toxins \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCadmium is almost in any industrial process there is\n\n So, cadmium usually creates kidney cancer and some other cancers, but kidney cancer's most prominent from cadmium and smoke tars.\n\n \r\nSo, you have one molecule of cadmium, it may take 50 calcium molecules, 5 potassium, about 7 magnesium to bind with one.\n\n So, you know how many minerals you're using just to take care of the pollution.\n\n So, you have to have a lot of minerals in our environment, especially living in this city.\n\n \r\nThere are more vehicles in this city than any other city in the world.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Celery and Carrot Juice \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nI noticed in the book you have certain recipes for vegetable juice, is there any other ones that you recommend\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends upon a condition?\n\n Those are the main that anybody can relate to if they have the problems that I suggested there, but you could pick up Walkers Vegetable Juice Book and then see what he recommends for certain conditions.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah, he's got carrot and everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, but you only want to use a little bit of carrot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHe’s got turnips and beets.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou just use a small amount of those if you're gonna use them.\n\n No more than 10% of your juice.\n\n If it's something strong, like leaks, cilantro, kale, any of those are really hot and strong.\n\n You want to use no more than 5% of your juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSomewhere there's like a list of like how much carbohydrates are in vegetables.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell.\n\n I think that the USDA has a book on that and you can download it.\n\n It has an index on that.\n\n But, you know, you use salary and that's your negative.\n\n So, you can use higher carbohydrate things, it’s just the celery will bring it down.\n\n \r\nLike sometimes I'll give somebody 20% of their juice as carrot, but it has 60% or 70% celary to bring that down.\n\n But I know that that person can handle more high carbohydrates without ending up in the brain.\n\n So, they have a lot of bile in their body and that bile needs to be removed.\n\n \r\nA lot of that high carbohydrates gonna be used to digest the carotene to neutralize the bile.\n\n So, you're getting heavy into chemistry there and you better know your chemistry if you’re screwing with something like that.\n\n But if you have very yellow skin any particular time, it means you're throwing off a lot of bile, a higher amount of carrot juice would be fine.\n\n \r\nJust make sure you use celery as your negative base.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Cereal Is Nutrient Enriched \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nBut if it’s all this chemical, why would they bother putting it in cereal\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to understand the damage that they do when they process a cereal to make it into a long shelf lasting food?\n\n There's nothing alive left in it.\n\n \r\nThey destroy all the vitamins in it.\n\n So, then what they do is we came into this in the 60s.\n\n We got into the nutrient enriched food.\n\n Now when it first came out, it was McGovern mcg.\n\n  \r\nMcGovern came out and he was the head of the committee on nutrition and he said we have to have chemically free food; we need to do this and do this and do that.\n\n Eat less red meat and stuff like that.\n\n He was from Iowa, that's a farming state, so he got them crazy, and of course he didn't win the election.\n\n The next election of Senator or anything else.\n\n \r\nHe didn't win the election because the whole farming communities and the states were against him from that.\n\n From that incident, it became a nutrient science.\n\n Well, this has vitamins in it that says vitamin A, this says vitamin D and they forgot all the other nutrients.\n\n They would plug just certain vitamins and certain nutrients and they would sell you on that, oh, this has got this and this in this food.\n\n And it's a sales pitch.\n\n It's to get you to buy it when it's no good.\n\n Anything that claims we've got good nutrients in this, stay away from it as far as you can away from it, because you know, it's one of the worst foods you can buy.\n\n It has no nutrient value and they're putting just a few in and they're chemical too, and they're just selling you a product.\n\n That's what it's all about.\n\n \r\nAll those third world countries, all the care packages you send, all the care you give.\n\n They go to Kellogg’s and Purina and general foods and buy the worst cereals in the world.\n\n Powdered milks, give it with water.\n\n To these third world children.\n\n \r\nThey get tape worms, they get diabetes, they have all these kind of diseases and they kill them.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cheese Before Anything If Mercury Dumping \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nHow much cheese are you talking about\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDepends upon the person?\n\n I tell people, they have mercury formaldehyde and aluminum in their stomach, like from vaccines.\n\n I tell them to eat cheese 10 minutes before they eat anything, unless they're drinking milk in between meals.\n\n  \r\nAnd then with the meat meal, I suggest eating at least a tablespoon too with a meat meal.\n\n \r\nAnd then after the meat meal to have minerals that you absorb from the cheese, you eat cheese and honey together.\n\n The honey to the cheese is one third honey to the cheese.\n\n One tablespoon of cheese.\n\n It's one teaspoon of honey.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Cheese To Detox \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nYou told me to eat sugar cubed size of raw cheese unsalted salted, and when I do it I love it because when I do it, my mouth becomes so watery, and I have to keep swallowing it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n But that's a different kind of thing.\n\n That's getting the poisons out of the brain and into the cheese rather than your system.\n\n \r\nAnd I don't like people chewing their cheese all that much because it'll pull all the poisons out of the brain, and I want the cheese to absorb most of the poisons that are dumping into the stomach intestines.\n\n So, you don't want to chew it so much that you get a very liquid, unless like this.\n\n Now in order to get this to go down fast, so it was this big yesterday at this time, it was this big, all the way over.\n\n And my whole eye was swollen up.\n\n So, I just started eating the cheese and getting it till it was completely liquid, my mouth was full and then I spit it out.\n\n And by nighttime, this had gone down by 70%.\n\n And then this morning, another 10%.\n\n \r\nSo, you can use cheese as a, as a way to absorb and get rid of poison.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Chickens and Cows Eat Grains \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nChickens eat grains\n\n That's for the birds.\n\n That’s who eat grains on this planet, mainly are birds.\n\n I've seen cows out in the pasture, as soon as the grains dry on the grass and it hits the ground.\n\n That's the first thing they'll suck up, but they may not get more than no more than two cups of grain a day.\n\n \r\nAnd that's what they're usually fed in milking time, so that's fine.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Citric Acid Cycle, Macronutrients \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nI was talking about the Citric acid cycle\n\n When your body uses fat as energy, it uses fat as 80% of that chemical combination.\n\n It uses pyruvate 8% to 15% and vitamin C or carbohydrate is 5%.\n\n That combination is the perfect ideal combination to get the most amount of energy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat is pyruvate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPyruvate is a sugar made from protein that has no high advanced glycation byproduct?\n\n**[Attendee#2]**\n  \r\nI'm sorry.\n\n Pyruvate was what again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPyruvate is a sugar made from protein, it's a protein sugar?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo you buy that or it comes from a combination of foods or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour body makes it from protein?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, you would feed your body protein and fats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt makes pyruvate?\n\n \r\nSo, your diet, as far as sugar needs, high carbohydrate needs is only 5% high carbohydrate foods.\n\n That’s why you have one fruit meal a day and that handles it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, the point of this whole pyruvate thing, what was that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, there wasn't any point?\n\n It was just to show you that you need very little carbohydrates.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Corn Fed Meat \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCorn-fed chicken and corn-fed beef, my grandparents raised them\n\n We had 52 acres of corn that we raised every year, and we fed that to the dairy cause they owned a dairy farm that fed all the cities within a hundred miles West of Chicago and ago.\n\n We fed the cows corn during milking and then grass that we grew on some other acres.\n\n  \r\nWe had a silo that was about 55 feet high, and we fill it every year with corn and we'd just take the husks off cause it would mold.\n\n \r\nSo, we'd just take that off, but leave the corn on the cob and then give it to the cows cause the cows love that center of the cob, it’s like sugarcane, so it's really sweet.\n\n They could digest the corn and make it into an acetone, which is a fat substance.\n\n It's like chickens that are fed corn, it makes that very yellow, fat, so tasty.\n\n And you can't get that with soy.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Cramps From Not Enough Fat \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSame thing with me\n\n I go over to Thailand.\n\n I've got three girlfriends over there.\n\n So, one at night, sometimes all three on the same day cause they don't last.\n\n I don't know, women just there don't, they can't take much fucking, so they get sore easily.\n\n So, and when I get into it, I get into it.\n\n\r\nSo, all of a sudden, at the end of that time that I'm there.\n\n I get thinner because I don't have my milk.\n\n I take lots of butter with me and I eat lots of meat fat, but it still doesn't put on the weight like the milk does.\n\n So, then I'll start getting more cramps in my feet and my calves.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen my weight's going thinner, I get the more cramps.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n That's it.\n\n So, that's why I like to get as fat as I can before I go.\n\n I'm working on it.\n\n  But you know, the last time I came back, I was a30 inch waist, in June when I returned.\n\n Now I'm up to a 37 inch waist.\n\n I'm getting ready.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nSo, on the weigh, that would be a good thing for me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n That's what I said.\n\n To get the urea out, you can use the whey.\n\n That can thin your blood as long as you're not getting too acidic.\n\n**[Jim],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, every time I have a juice, I could just-\r\n\n\r\nPut a little whey in.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nAnd how about whey before I go to bed or if I wake up in the middle of the night, something like that is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't have too much of it.\n\n\r\nIf you're having cramps everywhere in your body, then you've got urea building up.\n\n If you're not having that, thickened blood is not your problem.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nWhat is my problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour problem is you have some urea built up in your chest?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Doctors Used To Be Better \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEven when I was a kid, our family doctor used to sit there and sometimes it would take him a week before he'd make a decision on what the problem was and what could be done about it\n\n Too often he would resort to penicillin because he didn't know his butt from a hole  in the ground, but at least he did some thinking before he made any decision.\n\n \r\nYeah, these guys, “Oh, this is the latest thing for that.\n\n Pop this pill, pop this combination?\n\n That didn't work.\n\n Here's another set.\n\n” And that's the way it goes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIn other countries they don't do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n Well, they're doing it in a lot of other countries.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNothing compare to Americans.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n Nothing like here.\n\n Definitely.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThey give you these pills saying, tell me what happens.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes.\n\n See how this works.\n\n You're a guinea pig.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Drinking Whey \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut  that's okay\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot really?\n\n You have to be careful with that too.\n\n It's very acidic, whey is very acidic.\n\n Whey is when you separate the curds from the liquid, it looks kind of like a chartreuse color, kind of greenish yellow.\n\n That's whey, that's the liquid.\n\n \r\nIt's very concentrated in lactic acid, so it helps break down minerals that clump together that can cause stones.\n\n And it also helps get neutralize urea, uric acid that builds up in the muscles, it causes muscle cramps.\n\n When people are exercising a lot or they have poor cleansing after heavy metabolism or exercise and they get charlie horses.\n\n \r\nThat's from urea, uric acid building up in the muscles and the muscle gets so acidic from it, it contracts.\n\n Well, the whey and the lactic acid in it helps neutralize that urea, the uric acid.\n\n They're both acid though, so it creates an acidic condition that can start dissolving cells, start dissolving your muscles.\n\n \r\nThat's why those people who take all those whey powders to build muscles, soon as they stop exercising, all of a sudden everything goes sag.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Dry Mouth \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNow most people drink because their mouth gets dry\n\n Remember that when I said that when the brain has the most toxins, heavy metal toxins, when it detoxifies it does it through the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands.\n\n It rips all of the fats out of the face.\n\n That's why you see people shrivel up in the face.\n\n  \r\nBecause all those poisons are dumping out the mouth and it's taking all the fats in the localized area with it.\n\n Why do you think people wrinkle in the face so much and they don't wrinkle in other parts of the body as they do the face.\n\n Because it's getting the least fat?\n\n It's ripping more fats out of it than anywhere else.\n\n  \r\nThere are two things you can do.\n\n You can eat some butter and honey together to help lubricate that area.\n\n The quickest fat to lubricate this area is in honey.\n\n With coconut cream, if you use like 10 tablespoons of honey with 1 tablespoon of coconut cream, it just turns it into a cloudy honey.\n\n And you put that on your lips and as you lick it off all throughout the day, you're absorbing all those fats into it.\n\n It'll get rid of wrinkles and everything.\n\n  \r\nI don't know if anybody remembers how wrinkled my mouse was getting about three years ago.\n\n And I started using that about two years ago and I only do it when I do long engagements in speaking.\n\n Just for those couple of times a week that I use them on that day, it starts replidizing all of my face and it'll help remove those wrinkles.\n\n \r\nIf I were more vain, I'd be doing it every day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Fatty Meat, Sheep \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nOh\n\n And the freezing does cause fat molecules to swell.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThe sheeps have this huge hail, which is all fat.\n\n I'm just trying to go back and eat them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n Now, the lanolin in sheep fat is very heavy.\n\n It's not like seal.\n\n Seal is so rich that you can eat just a little bit of seal and be stuffed for the whole day.\n\n \r\nYou could get a third of that compared to what you could eat a beef, you get a third of a pound compared to a whole pound of beef and it's very filling and fulfilling.\n\n So, sheep is the same way.\n\n The meat itself isn't, but the fat is very rich and very concentrated.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Filtered Water Isnt Good, Naturally Carbonated Canget Rid Of Stains \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGas isn't that important, it just helps generate more oxygen in the blood eventually, once turns into nitrogen in the intestines and carbon dioxide and that whole process\n\n It is kind of a slight antiseptic because the carbon dioxide is a kind of a hydroegen peroxide.\n\n \r\nIt's like, if you get a stain, let's say you get something with blood on it and you just put the carbonated water on it.\n\n Stains come right out.\n\n It'll bleach your material if you don't wash it out with plain water.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you get that carbon out, it won't have that type of reaction again.\n\n \r\nSo, it helps clear and clarify some things in the body.\n\n That's the only water that I drink.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Glands Or Cheese With Honey For Energy \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n\r\nWell, there are two things you could do\n\n You can eat glands, eat glandular soups.\n\n Like I said, that'll give you a lot of extra hormones so that the ones that you are using to deal with the toxins, and you can also eat more cheese.\n\n Little cheese with honey twice a day, about 30, 35 minutes after your meat meal, nd that'll give you a lot more energy.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Herbivores Can Eat Soy \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nA soy fed animal\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI wouldn't touch it.\n\n Well, wait a minute.\n\n Cows and, and herbivores can eat soy, raw soy.\n\n It just doesn't taste very good.\n\n The meat tastes like postage stamps.\n\n It has this odd taste.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Honey 90% Enzymes \n \n \n \n \n### (30) Honey Was Making Aajonus Tired \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nHow to get your milk not to look like yogurt\n\n Did you add honey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, this I didn't?\n\n I got tired of having so much honey, and it started making me sleepy.\n\n S,o it was time to get off the honey for a while.\n\n So, it's been about two weeks where I hadn't had much honey with the milk.\n\n \r\nI was doing it to gain more weight because I have extra cream with it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI drank some of your milk in the seminar and it tasted great.\n\n The other pithcer of milk was sour.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPut the honey in as soon as it gets to room temperature or near room temperature.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAfter five hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSometimes it's as early as three hours?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThey helps preserve it too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, it does?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much honey would I put it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTwo tablespoons per quart, so I would've put four table screws in here?\n\n I blenderize it, and poured back in the rest of it.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Hot Tub \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, in my hot tub that I have, that I built\n\n I got a 300-pound Hayward sand filter, which is big enough to take care of a swimming pool, but I didn't want to clean and change the sand every year in my hot tub.\n\n And I don't put any chemicals in it, so I have all this algae that grows on the concrete walls that I had built in this hot tub.\n\n \r\nSo, I like that algae.\n\n Gets nice and thick and hairy, but the water stays crystal clear because of the sand filter.\n\n Cleans every bit of everything out of it.\n\n  So, it cleans and filters very well, but it allows the algae to grow and it's an excellent filter.\n\n It'll pull out almost anything.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) How Much Aajonus Pees \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nIn Iran when I was a kid, we were playing three hours of soccer every day in that hot sweat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, in Iran.\n\n Very little water.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nDo you still pee a lot or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I drink so much milk for the minerals hat I do pee probably about half of what I drink?\n\n So, when I'm in Asia and I'm not drinking a lot of milk and I'm drinking the minimal amount of water, I'm peeing just a little bit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) How Much Honey Is Too Much \n \n \n \n \n### (34) How Much Water Aajonus Drinks and Raw Milk In Asia \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut I don't drink water, I probably had a half a cup of water in the last month\n\n When I'm in Asia and can't get much milk, I will drink about two cups a day besides my juice.\n\n I still will make juice in Asia, unless I'm in Singapore.\n\n I get the raw milk from Australia, but it's called Cleopatra's Bath Milk.\n\n That's how they sell it, as milk for bathing and not for drinking.\n\n So, that's what I get there and different parts of Malaysia, Bali, I can get that there, but in Northern Asia and Lous, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, I can't get it there, unless I find a farmer.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) How To Prepare Organs \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nHow do you prepare your organs\n\n Do you blenderize them?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI just go right into them?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThere's recipes in the recipe book.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n I have some recipes in the recipe book how you can eat them.\n\n I'm a very bland either.\n\n My mother rarely ever used seasoning.\n\n \r\nI was not developed with seasoning taste.\n\n In fact, they usually made me ill and I can't take many seasoning.\n\n So, I usually eat everything plain, even insects.\n\n So, you're asking me about seasoning.\n\n I used to be a gourmet chef.\n\n**[French]**\n, which is a dish that you have to do all these many different steps and it takes the average person about 7 hours to make, I could do it in 5.\n\n5 hours cause I was pretty fast with it, but you have to wait till it cooks and you have to cook it in different stages with different foods to make it really nice.\n\n \r\nI mean, it was superb.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Humans Used To Have Trichinosis \n \n \n \n \n### (37) Kefir Grains \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nHow are you making your kefir\n\n Grains?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWith the grains?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, okay.\n\n I don't recommend people use grains.\n\n It's a way to do it.\n\n The grains will pre-digest your milk, so that you will utilize more nutrients in of the fats, the proteins and the carbohydrates, but those bacteria compete with the bacteria in your intestines.\n\n \r\nPrevent your own bacteria from growing properly, will even eat the bacteria in your intestines.\n\n So, I recommend my recipe book, how to make your own kefir from the natural bacteria in the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI was thinking of giving it to my grandson that is one year old.\n\n So, maybe not do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo.\n\n Well, that would be okay.\n\n Better than anything else he would get, but if you want to build his digestive system, digestive tract.\n\n Then you would give him the stuff that you would make just by putting a little honey in it and letting it sit in the cupboard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHe's having raw milk and the raw eggs from whole tube.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, good.\n\n Well, that's still better than any other garbage he'd be getting, so still a big step in the right direction.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) LA Water \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat water's already been used twice by industry in \n here in the valley\n\n And then it goes, the third time is the LA area and Malibu's on the LA area branch.\n\n So, it's the chemicals that are in the water from industry and everybody dumping their paint and chemicals and nail polished remover, and everything goes into our water system.\n\n It's still in the water.\n\n  \r\nThey take out all the germs, the bacteria, which I don't give a shit about.\n\n The chemicals that they leave is the problem.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Meat For Clarity, Milk With Eggs \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nIt keeps you very clear\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n It keeps you pretty clear.\n\n Meat's a little bit more effective because in the milk you have a higher carbohydrate activity, but if you're using it with eggs, probably balances it cause most of the carbohydrate will go to digest the yolk in the milk.\n\n But you won't gain weight on that diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nUh, well, I'm not really trying to gain weight?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Milk With Honey, Honey, How Muchmilk \n \n**[2007],[Richard]**\n\r\n\n \r\nI haven't totally got into your full, raw food diet yet, but I drink raw milk with honey, 3 – 5 times a day, 16 ounces\n\n Is there any detrimental effect to that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou mean as far as the amount of milk?\n\n**[Richard]**\n \r\nMilk and, or honey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, should be fine for a while.\n\n I mean, if you're on the diet for probably 4 or 5 years, then too much honey, you have to watch the amount of honey that you consume according to the amount of meat that you're eating because it can cause a protein deficiency.\n\n But right nwo that's fine.\n\n \r\nWell also, I drink one of these a day minimum.\n\n Half a gallon of milk.\n\n Even up to three quarts of milk.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Organ Meats \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nIt all depends on what you have wrong in your body, what your body needs\n\n If you know what organs and glands are weak, those are the ones you go for.\n\n If you've got a severe protein deficiency, go for liver because the liver and the heart are the most concentrated in protein, the heart doesn't have all the bile and fat digesting, enzymes and activity that the liver does.\n\n So, the liver helps you if you have a poor digestion of fats, you over metabolize fats because you're not digesting fats quickly enough, the liver is the thing they need.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFrom what animal  \r\n\n \r\nDoesn't matter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nChicken?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDoesn't matter?\n\n \r\nAny animal whatsoever.\n\n It can be a gopher.\n\n Greasy, greasy gopher guts.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nBut you said only eat organ meats from organic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n I said glands from organic.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nIs a liver not a gland.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, it's an organ?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nSo, you could eat liver that's not organic then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, I wouldn't.\n\n But yeah, you could.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nWhat about a soy fed animal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI wouldn't?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) People Are Weak Now Fro Mvaccines, Get Fat \n \n \n \n \n### (43) Pills Are 99% Filler \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey can only use so much medication before it creates a dangerous reaction, so they have all this other filler\n\n This waste garbage product that goes in with, and maybe the chemical is 1% of the whole pill, then 99% of that pill is just garbage.\n\n \r\nToxins that you're just putting into the system and the coatings.\n\n You know,how many dyes there are in that.\n\n How many other chemicals just in your coatings?\n\n It's embarrassing that some of our most educated, well-bred minds are complete idiots?\n\n \r\nAnd I mean idiots that they just buy whatever they're told, it's a shame.\n\n There's no science to it.\n\n The information's given to them by the pharmaceutical industry, and they just regurgitate it to everybody.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Powdered Whey \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nBodybuilders eat the powdered whey, dehydrated\n\n So they can pump and pump and pump and their muscles don't get sore, but it's chalk.\n\n So, they have all this swollen fat that takes a lot of H20 to hydrate the tissues, so they're blown up with a lot of water.\n\n It also looks good, but it isn't very strong.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI cramp up when I'm being sexual.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou got a lot of urea, but see you had a lot of fat on you before and now you don't have that fat.\n\n Your body got used to all that fat, could take all that urea, and had a place to go.\n\n Now it doesn't have a place to go cause you're not very fat.\n\n \r\nYou don't have enough fat on you.\n\n The more fat, the less cramping you have.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Raw Honey, Frozen, Sugar Feedign \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nThe only way to know that is to get my list, if you want to know those that are confirmed truly raw\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs it okay to give him honey just from bees.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI mean, if you wanna know for sure you give him the honeycomb, then you know that it hasn't been heated because it's still in a comb and there's no heat to it?\n\n \r\nIt doesn't mean that they didn't use antibiotics on the hive or with the bees, and it doesn't mean they didn't use corn syrup to feed them in the winter.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to know that stuff too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAnd ask her if they froze it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf it freezes, it crystallizes, but usually in those combs, they won't freeze it because that'll cause it to become brittle and then they'll break open and become a big mess.\n\n So, they don't freeze.\n\n Usually don't freeze comb honey.\n\n \r\n[This is actually not true.\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat about honey that is crystallized from the co-op, do I have to warm it up to a certain amount  \r\n\n \r\nNo, but you better find out whether it's been frozen to cause it to crystallize.\n\n Because freezing destroys a lot of enzymes in the honey.\n\n It makes it more on the order of sugar.\n\n And James doesn't carry everything that I agree with.\n\n \r\nAnd he put that notice up there, took me two years to get him to put up that notice, but he finally put it up.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhere is your listing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe order form is in the back of the book?\n\n Oh, it's also in the website.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAre those eggs from whole foods really fertile.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFertile just means that the roosters are running around getting laid right before the hens lay?\n\n \r\nAnd that ensures that your chicken is not just in a small cage the size of its body as almost all the eggs that you get from a supermarket, regular supermarket.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Reagan Ruined Unions, Banned Raw Milk \n \n \n \n \n### (47) Reverse Osmosis \n \n**[2007],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nWhat about reverse osmosis  \r\n\n \r\nReverse osmosis doesn't take out chemicals only\n\n It'll remove chlorine.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDo you know what company has a three-tier system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, the particular one that I suggest, nobody has it?\n\n You have to take the three-tier system and make it your own.\n\n You have to put the sand in the one.\n\n Well, they do have the charcoal and they do have the paper filters, but the center one, and they have a reverse, they usually use the charcoal as the last, but the charcoals are first, the sand is the second.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nCan we request them to set it up for us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n But they probably don't even have a sand filter, but you can ask.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHow do you get that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you just have to buy the sand and go to a nice beach and get it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAnd buy a filter yourself or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no, they have the three-tier system?\n\n \r\nYou pull their filter out of it and put your sand in it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Soy Fed Chicken \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nWhite\n\n And it's also very toxic because humans and poultry cannot eat raw soy.\n\n It has enzymes, which will kill us and kill them.\n\n So, it has to be heat treated and chemically treated to feed.\n\n So, if cows eat it, I'll eat it, but it won't be as tasty.\n\n They feed it to birds.\n\n I try to stay away from any poultry is fed more than 25% soy.\n\n I won't eat it.\n\n  \r\nAnd if I had my druthers, I wouldn't eat any poultry or eggs that were made from soy or grown on soy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, back to where he asked what from what animals do you recommend.\n\n Like what farms or what kind of?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I did most of my meats from the Amish, Amish farmers?\n\n Who grow more naturally and aren't heavy into soy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAbout the question in Whole Food, when you buy a whole chicken, the organs come with it.\n\n Can you eat it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, they don't come with everything?\n\n They come with a few things.\n\n Come with the neck, gizzard, heart, and liver and that's it.\n\n But you can eat those.\n\n Like I say the Rocky feeds theirs 25% soy, so it's not best.\n\n  \r\nBut the so-called Rosy organic, it's a lie.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd now they're selling Mary, they running out of Rocky.\n\n \r\nThey say it's the same thing.\n\n  \r\nThey almost don't have any Rocky.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nThere's only one Whole Foods I found that carries Rocky.\n\n They've all given up Rocky, they all carry Mary's now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI haven't talked with Mary's, so I don't know, but if Whole Foods is selling it, you know it's shit.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nI did ask and they are feeding Mary's soy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to find out how much, see when I called Rosy Organic, I said, “You're feeding them 75% soy.\n\n” And I said, “Wait a minute, you can't feed soy raw to chickens.\n\n You have to chemically, and heat treat it.\n\n” “Yeah, but the soy was growing organically.\n\n” \r\nBut I said, “Once you treat the soy and you're feeding them the chemical soy, it's no longer organic.\n\n” “Well, the FDA lets us call it that.\n\n” I said, “Well, let's talk about ethics here.\n\n“ They had none.\n\n They don't give a shit.\n\n They're selling an item and if they can call it anything, they want to call it to make it sell, they will do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLily’s farm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, they feed theirs some soy, about 20%, 25%?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat chicken you eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI eat from a chicken farm that doesn't feed theirs any soy?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs it from James Stewart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n From James.\n\n Either that or Rocky.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Synthetic Vitamins \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThose are chemically formulated, they're not natural, and they're never complete and correct\n\n Riboflavin might have 42 components to make it up.\n\n They may put third of that, two thirds of that component in there and call it riboflavin.\n\n  \r\nDid I mention the, what vitamin E is at the workshop.\n\n \r\n99% of vitamin E is the byproduct of Fiji and Kodaks developing film and it is a highly toxic substance and they used to have to bury it in 12-foot-thick concrete tombs in the ground, in stainless steel barrels?\n\n It's costing them hundreds of million dollars a year.\n\n  \r\nBecause in Japan, they used to just dump it into the surrounding bays and water.\n\n 40 years ago, you could drop your film into the local bay and it would develop, it was that bad.\n\n And the cancer rate started escalating very high, so they stopped it.\n\n  \r\nSo, Kodak and Fuji were at an impasse there, so they had to start burying everything.\n\n Well, Kodak's been that way for a long time.\n\n And then one of their scientists, they kept hiring scientists to try to neutralize, clean up that chemical so that they could be recycled or at least led into the earth somewhere, so when it got into the water system, it wouldn't damage it.\n\n They couldn't do it.\n\n One of the scientists said, “You know, it's 72% like vitamin E let's call it vitamin E and get everybody to drink it, eat it, we’ll sell it as vitamin E”.\n\n So, they called it alpha-tocopherol or just tocopherol and D-alpha- tocopherol is the true food vitamin E.\n\n \r\nSo, that's the way they put it.\n\n So, FDA said, “Okay’”.\n\n So, now 99% of the vitamin E, even the so-called natural in your vitamin stores, they'll put five international units of the natural, mostly from soy, which is toxic anyway.\n\n Very toxic, cause the oils that are so poisonous to fowl, the poultry community and the human community is in the oil, the poisons.\n\n \r\nSo, they have to chemically alter that oil.\n\n That's where the vitamin e is, so you got a chemical again in it, a solvent in it, and a neutralizer.\n\n So, the 95 units that correct come directly from Fuji and Kodak are in there.\n\n Plus these processed, so-called natural five international units.\n\n That's what you're taking.\n\n**[unclear]**\n, in Beverly Hills, the big one.\n\n Dyan Cannon used to come in and buy two to three bottles of vitamin a week, and I tried to talk her out of it, but she was sold on it just made her skin very translucent and beautiful, but it also did that to her whole nervous system.\n\n \r\nSo, did anybody see her biography or movie of the week biography.\n\n About 10 years ago, she became a complete basket case, all kinds of psychological problems, drug problems into there from that?\n\n And her skin got so thin and she still couldn't stop herself from taking it.\n\n That was after two years of taking it a tremendous amount every day, her skin, you could just take it like this and it would tear.\n\n \r\nAnd she thought that she had some kind of disease.\n\n And I said, it’s the vitamin E she could not believe that they would allow Kodak and Fuji to sell this chemical that was poisoning her.\n\n You have to understand that a lot of people don't believe what industry will do to make a buck.\n\n They don't care, what happens to you.\n\n \r\nThey really don't.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Thin People Disolve Bone, Honey & Cheese \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nAnybody as thin as you are starts eating its own bone\n\n It's a very fragile balance because the mineral level usually falls very low because of the fat, there's no reserve on your body.\n\n So, any part of the day that your body gets mineral deficient, it goes for your own bone.\n\n To start eating at your own bone.\n\n \r\nThat's why people that are very thin lose a lot of bone.\n\n That’s why people who have cancer, the body needs a lot of minerals to bind with the solvent reaction from the cancer.\n\n So, the bones just start eating away and deteriorating because the body needs all those minerals.\n\n  \r\nSo, I think first you need to gain excess weight to have a reserve on, with that fat you reserve of minerals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nFrom vegetables and vegetable juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, from fats?\n\n Butter, heese, butter, and cheese together is the quickest way to mineralize you.\n\n \r\nNow him, he's already overweight.\n\n I can tell him to eat cheese and honey together, and he will absorb all those minerals, but the honey and cheese have to be eaten together in the same mouth to digest the cheese.\n\n \r\nIn the human body the cheese will not digest, it'll act as a magnet and a sponge to hold onto the poison and pass it out of the body.\n\n So, you have to eat honey and cheese together in the mouth to absorb those minerals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay, because I have eaten the raw cheese.\n\n What you're saying is when I eat the raw cheese, I need to eat it with honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nTwo times a day?\n\n \r\nOther times you want the cheese to pull the poisons out of your body.\n\n So, it’ll free the minerals up in your food to balance and keep your bones and teeth and everything else together.\n\n To make everything else work.\n\n Cause we're so full of metal poisonings from pollution, from food, from water, from everything that a body is using a lot of the minerals to bind with toxins.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Thirsty \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nWhen you were on the subject of water that we brought, if you're thirsty, but you're not hungry\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAgain, what do you determine as thirst?\n\n Your mouth is dry?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, it's stomach?\n\n It's not just mouth.\n\n \r\nYeah, my mouth's dry.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThen drink milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut I get too fat.\n\n I just put on fat and it just, even when I drink the kefir, and then I add weight and I feel sluggish.\n\n I don't get energy.\n\n So, could vegetable juice or certain types.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nVegetable juice will help, will make it better?\n\n Just drink celery.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nCan you drink water when you're thirsty.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I tell everybody to tomatoes, eat some tomato drink that you put a little lemon in, a little vinegar, some cream?\n\n I’ve got one professional tennis player that I have her drinking cucumber juice, straight cucumber juice with a little bit of coconut cream and a little bit of dairy cream in it, and that hydrates her.\n\n She only has a quart a day and she can play all day long on just a quart a day.\n\n You see those other tennis players downing a gallon, gallon and a half a day.\n\n So ,she only puts down a quart a day, and this is a woman who's six-foot-tall, Canadian tennis player.\n\n So, she's really up there.\n\n \r\nSo, that's the kind of thing to do.\n\n Look for other things other than water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCucumbers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nI once asked you this question too, and ever since you gave me the answer, I've been doing it ever since.\n\n I eat cucumbers and tomatoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere you go.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nI just came from the market, I bought 9 baskets of the organic tomatoes.\n\n I carry them everywhere.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd that keeps you from drinking all that water.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n And I get bags of organic cucumbers and peel them.\n\n It's great.\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n \r\nPeel them.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nPeel the cucumbers?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause if you're already taking that much cucumber in, you don't want all those peels.\n\n They'll turn your digestive tract alkaline and you won't be able to digest your meats and your dairy as well.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBut for your vegetable juice, you don't have to do them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, because you're extracting the pulp?\n\n Anybody who has really rich green bowel movements, you need to filter your juice.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIt shouldn’t be green.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot unless you're throwing off some gangrenous tissue, but then it'll be a gray-green, not a bright green, a rich green?\n\n That's too much cellulose from your vegetable juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo you have to peel the vegetables then for your green juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no, no?\n\n You just have to filter your juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThrough like a coffee filter or something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, just take a screen, a very fine screen, just pour through the screen?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLike Muslim cloth or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMuslim cloth is even better if you want to do that, it takes a lot of time to go?\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) Tiredness From Healing, Detox, Vaccines \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nIt's better now, but for the past six months, especially last summer, I was going through like extreme tiredness last summer\n\n I just worked 4 hours and spent the rest of the day in bed.\n\n And then I got better and then I got a little cold and then I got worse again.\n\n I kind of know I'm doing some sort of detox, but now finally I'm almost up to half normal.\n\n I'm just kind of wondering at the lecture thing you said it was like healing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMost of your tiredness, sleepiness comes from the healing stage.\n\n 90% of healing happens in the sleep state, unless you're a Yogi and can get into that sub alpha wave where you heal while you're awake.\n\n I can do that.\n\n So, I don’t have to sleep as much to heal.\n\n  \r\nHowever, when I get sleepy, I take full advantage of it, but I really don't get very sleepy, unless something's poisoning me and then I'll sleep more.\n\n  \r\nA lot of lethargy comes from your body using the hormones that you produce for physical energy on detoxifying, on binding with poisons.\n\n  \r\nTakes a lot of molecules of good nutrients to bind with just one toxic nutrient.\n\n Take mercury for example, one molecule of mercury takes 200 white blood cells or 2000 fat cells to control one molecule of mercury.\n\n It's a lot of nutrients to handle one molecule of mercury, and in vaccines, now you have 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury per vaccine, and there used to be 76 up until a year ago, 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury.\n\n It only takes 200 to be antiseptic.\n\n So, anything beyond 200 is absolute direct, purposeful poisoning.\n\n The government is purposefully poisoning you.\n\n If everybody were smart and intelligent and healthy as they were a hundred years ago, the government couldn't get away with what it's doing.\n\n All these shenanigans.\n\n  \r\nSo, they want everybody weak.\n\n They want everybody toxic.\n\n They want everybody having lots of babies.\n\n They want everybody being in debt.\n\n So, the two greatest things that they've created in this society to control people was credit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Tooth Being Abosrbed, Cheese & Honey \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nMy tooth here, it became loose for no reason last week, slightly loose and very uncomfortable, no hurting\n\n What could cause that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEither you have some mercury or some kind of toxin in the nerve, and it was dumping along the gum line and opened up all of the tissue or started melting the bone away temporarily?\n\n \r\nDid you have any pain there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n Your body was taking minerals out of your bone to deal with that toxicity that's in this area.\n\n \r\nYou just need to eat cheese and cheese with honey.\n\n \r\nNo, because he's absorbing his bone, but he had pain.\n\n That would mean toxins coming out.\n\n If he has no pain, that means when he's losing bone, that means his body's eating his minerals up where that nerve goes to deal with toxins.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Water \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nHe has no idea\n\n He has no idea about testing.\n\n He's just accepting other people who are selling the products, and I don't believe any of them.\n\n Until I've tested something, I don't believe it because I've just seen too much biased way of thinking and not considering everything.\n\n \r\nWater is a solvent.\n\n The more things you put into it, the more damage it's going to do to your system.\n\n How many people saw The Rabbit Proof fence here.\n\n It's about the Australian kids, mainly girls who were part of Aboriginal and part British?\n\n  \r\nSo, the British government comes and says we can't have our partially British girls living with their primitive mothers who are aboriginal.\n\n \r\nSo, they take the children away from their mothers and put 'em in these Catholic orphanages and they're brutal and mean, and you know, no love or anything.\n\n And instead of with these wonderful loving Aboriginal mothers.\n\n \r\nSo, these three little girls run away.\n\n The oldest one is something like 12, 13, something like that, and then they get younger all the way down to about the age of 8 or 7.\n\n So, these three little girls run away, never drink a drop of water.\n\n They hike 2100 miles through up to 140 degrees in the bush and they break off branches and let the vegetable juice drop into their mouth, or they dug up a roof and they rung the vegetable juice out of it.\n\n \r\nThey go through a whole day of hiking on four ounces of vegetable juices.\n\n That's the way all animal bodies are made except for the camel and the elephant.\n\n Those are the only two animals who are geared to hold water and utilize it properly.\n\n Camel can hold 25 gallons of water and won't have to drink for 20 days, 25 days.\n\n  \r\nElephant can hold up to 200 gallons of water and not have to drink for a month to 40 days.\n\n Those animals are very different from human animals.\n\n Human animals are not built to drink water.\n\n  \r\nBack in the 40s and 50s when I was a child, you didn't drink water.\n\n If you went to the fountain, I didn't drink water, until I went to school, and then you just took three sips a day.\n\n And then all of a sudden, the sixties come around, bottled water comes into fashion.\n\n All of a sudden, eight glasses of water a day, eight glasses of water a day.\n\n That was the programming.\n\n  \r\nThe more of that you drink, the more soda pop you will drink, the more water you will drink, and it just dissolves the whole system.\n\n It leaches.\n\n Rain is water.\n\n It comes in and it dissolves earth so that plants can eat, it dissolves rock.\n\n So, when it comes into the body, it leeches all the good nutrients out of the intestines, your stomach walls, your mucus lining, everything, it dries out your system.\n\n \r\nThe cells can only absorb 10% of that water, and then that causes the same interaction, intracellularly.\n\n Intercellular dehydration.\n\n So, we're not meant to drink water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI have to say something about that.\n\n One time, years ago, I thought water, aha.\n\n Eureka.\n\n I found it.\n\n So, I was drinking eight ounces every 15 minutes for hours and hours during the day and was thirsty.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll the time.\n\n \r\nWhen I lived outdoors on a bicycle, I drank two gallons a day.\n\n And when I hit the desert, I nearly died.\n\n I had to bicycle through Mohave desert, and it wasn't even summer cause it's illegal.\n\n You cannot go through the Mohave desert, unless you sneak into it because they just block off old place and don't allow anybody in there, but residents who live there.\n\n And I nearly died and I still had a gallon of water with me.\n\n It wasn't enough, just kept going after because I was already dehydrated.\n\n  \r\nYou have to be lipidated.\n\n Fats need to be your body with lots of minerals to hold the fluids intact.\n\n \r\nYou shouldn't be transferring many fluids.\n\n You look at the animals in the wild, they pee maybe an ounce at a time, a tablespoon at a time.\n\n See the coyotes spit out a tablespoon of urine at a time.\n\n Very little urine do they pass.\n\n We stand there and we pee for how long.\n\n 30, 40 seconds, a minute, you know, and it's insane?\n\n \r\nWe're just wiping and washing out all these nutrients out of our body.\n\n It's not natural.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nUs women can't relate to that little example you just gave.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* okay, you sit, but it comes out very quickly like a horse.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI can relate to that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnd you may pee a cup, two cups at a time.\n\n \r\nThat's a lot of fluid when we should be only putting out a teaspoon or a tablespoon at a time, every five hours.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Whey, What To Have It With \n \n**[2007],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, you said that you should be careful with it, but how careful should I be with it\n\n How much should I?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I think that anybody who has whey, especially more than twice a day, should have it with vegetable juice?\n\n So, you have 4 - 8 ounces of vegetable juice, you have about three ounces of whey, and if you've got high toxicity, something like this, you might want to put a teaspoon of Terramin clay in it, and a teaspoon of chlorella.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, in other words, I could have a little bit of whey with almost a quarter vege juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, like I said, you could add 4 – 8 ounces of, of vegetable juice with3 ounces of whey?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nTogether.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, together?\n\n It’s because the whey is highly acidic with all the lactic acids in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat is the benefit for it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe whey helps get rid of urea, uric acid that builds up that causes muscle cramping also causes after exercising to get sore?\n\n That’s urea, that's uric acid that builds up in the muscles, so whey helps get rid of that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Women Feel Sgood Drinking Water \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, your blood may be getting so thick that it helps thin your blood so that things can work a little bit better\n\n You may have a high sugar content in your blood, but it's not the best way to do it.\n\n  \r\nBest way to do it is do a good diet, but we're talking about optimal here, but yes, water works in that situation and everybody needs a little water, but not as much water as we're drinking.\n\n \r\nAnd I stay away from water, unless I have to.\n\n Unless I have nothing else.\n\n If I don't have milk.\n\n**[Attendee],[unclear]**\n \r\nDo you know this water \n.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\nYeah \r\n\n \r\nDo you think it's good?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAgain, it's a processed filtered water that's like the air, the Arrowhead water?\n\n It's not really pure.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

vitamin C in it, which is worth two whole oranges of vitamin C, in one pound of meat\n\n  \r\nThat's why, when Vladimir Stevinson was in Alaska and ran across the sea captain who had had scurvy from being out at sea so long and not eating anything fresh.\n\n \r\nHe took vitamin C supplements.\n\n None of it worked for him.\n\n Started eating raw meat and in a week, scurvy was

well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEster-C, doesn’t matter?\n\n It's a chemical derivative.\n\n Doesn't look anything like natural vitamin C in food.\n\n It poisons the body.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nTwo whole oranges and one pound of meat daily.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no.\n\n I said that one pound of meat contains as much assimilable vitamin C as two oranges.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) 9 Of 10 People Die From Too Thin \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nCancer is something that everybody will have at least five times in their life\n\n You just hope it's never diagnosed.\n\n \r\nBecause once it's diagnosed, the doctors will scare you so bad you can shit in your pants and you'll run to be poisoned.\n\n I see it in 95% of all the cancer cases, they run to the doctors.\n\n The doctors convinced them that this is the only way out.\n\n It is the only way out all right, and it is the quickest way out.\n\n \r\nIf you look at Dr.\n\n Harmon B Jones's work at Berkeley, he found that people who did not get surgery, did not get any kind of therapy, lived in average of 12 and a half years after diagnosis.\n\n  \r\nThose people who had surgery or any other therapies lived in average of three years after diagnosis.\n\n \r\nSo, the medical profession is lying to you.\n\n Lying to you every time they say, “Oh, we'll extend your life.\n\n” You're gonna shorten it by four times.\n\n One fourth of your life, you'll shorten it that much.\n\n  \r\nThere's some people who are going to die of cancer.\n\n Now on my diet, 95% of the people live beyond five years and longer.\n\n \r\nIt's just that the medical profession says that they cured you if you lived five years.\n\n If on the five years and one day you got a new case, that's the way they that's the way they calculate it so that they can look good.\n\n  \r\nHowever, 17% make it beyond 6 years after medical treatment.\n\n 17% make it beyond 6 years.\n\n \r\nThat's a terrible average.\n\n On this diet, people make it by 95%.\n\n Still 5% people are going to die, and out of those 5% that have died on my diet, which is probably a total of about 58 people of cancer out of about somewhere around 500 now.\n\n So, that's really only 1%.\n\n  \r\nSo, those people have a much better chance, and 9 out of 10 people who died on this diet were too thin.\n\n So, when they went into the detoxification of the tumors, they couldn't handle all that dissolved tissue.\n\n So, they started have vomiting and having diarrhea and not able to gain weight and they wasted away.\n\n So, they wasted away.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Has One Cup Of Vege Juice A Day \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nYou may have one juice a day\n\n I've been eating raw foods since February of 1972.\n\n If I have more than one juice a day I don’t digest well, unless I'm going through a very acidic time where my skin's burning or something like that during a detoxication, then I could have more juice.\n\n \r\nAnd before I could have four cups a day.\n\n It was fine for 20 years, but after 20 years I had to cut it down a cup, then another five years, another cup and down to now, 28 years on eating meat on a daily basis, I'm down to one cup a day.\n\n Sometimes two, but mainly one.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Algae Chlorella \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nSome of the algae is okay, we can digest some of it\n\n Now, when I checked feces for the amount that's digested, let's say 10% is digested.\n\n It's very expensive food, but if it can help remove heavy metals, if it can promote any quality of health that you couldn't get from anything else, and it can, it can do that.\n\n It's worth it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLike what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLike heavy metal poisoning in the body, Mix it with vegetable juice?\n\n Don't have algae by itself or with water.\n\n You have it in vegetable juice.\n\n Just remember, it's dry.\n\n \r\nChlorella is an algae.\n\n But you wanna mix it with vegetable juice because it's a dried substance, it lacks enzymes.\n\n \r\nDifferent health food stores carry them.\n\n James at our Venice co-op here, Rawsome, carries a very good quality chlorella.\n\n Like I said, you're only gonna digest about 10% of it.\n\n Your feces will be nice and green because 90% of it won't adjust, but that 10% can do a lot for you.\n\n \r\nBut only take like a quarter of a teaspoon at a time to half a teaspoon, max.\n\n Otherwise it's just a waste.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Artifical Heat \n \n**[2007],[Atteendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nCan’t you keep your house hot, your house warm\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAs long as you've got enough plants in there to make good oxygen and there's moisture?\n\n So, you've gotta balance it.\n\n If you're gonna have your artificial heat, you've gotta balance the rest of your atmosphere.\n\n \r\nPut a humidifier in there or a bowl of water near something that's gonna evaporate, and some good plants are gonna create oxygen because your windows are gonna be shut.\n\n  \r\nAnd there are about seven plants that produce a lot of oxygen and you go on the internet and find them.\n\n \r\nCorn Dracaena.\n\n Any of the Dracaenas produce a lot of oxygen.\n\n Some of your vines produce a lot of oxygen, but you can go on the internet and put oxygen plants or plants oxygen production, and then you'll come up with websites and it'll give you the plants that produce the most oxygen and then get those for your home.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Bee Pollen Must Be Soft, Pain Formula \n \n \n \n \n### (7) Blocked Arties, Diarrhea, Get Back On Program Detnal Plagque Cancer Cells \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, I'm going to begin\n\n I've got a little bit of a crowd here, so I'm not going to tell any story, unless something interests me that somebody asks.\n\n Okay.\n\n So, we're gonna go around, start with you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI just recently had an incident where, as it turned out, there was a blocked artery and there wasn't any nutrients getting into my small intestine and I was getting very ill.\n\n A friend of mine just fixed it yesterday, and we discovered what the problem was, which was this blocked artery and could have ended up in surgery, but didn’t.\n\n \r\nBut what I had for two weeks was a lot of diarrhea and when I went back on your diet, it was just horrible.\n\n I couldn’t eat just the eggs or anything like that.\n\n  \r\nSo, what I want to know now in particular, first of all, something like that, I don't know what would've happened in terms of if the diet could have done anything to help that.\n\n I don't how it happened.\n\n  \r\nTwo things.\n\n \r\nOne is if I should get diarrhea seriously like that, and how do I wean myself back on the diet.\n\n Cause I know you can't really just couldn’t do that with milk and cheese and cream and stuff?\n\n I was eating a lot of cheese and I was doing the things and bananas and all of that, but like I said, it would temporarily stop.\n\n \r\nThe thing that really stopped it believe it or not was I should confess was cream of rye and rye toast with butter.\n\n I did put butter on it.\n\n  \r\nSo, my question really has to do with how to get back after you have an incident like that where you have to go off the program and how do you yourself back on specifically and generally, whenever something happens, when you go off, and you have to get yourself back.\n\n \r\nUsually, I’m the cold Turkey person?\n\n I just go right back.\n\n Hello.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay?\n\n First of all, she said that she thought she had a blocked artery to her small intestines and was having diarrhea, and that was the cause of diarrhea.\n\n Never could happen.\n\n If you had a blocked artery, you wouldn't have diarrhea, you'd have constipation, but you didn't have a blocked artery.\n\n Anytime you have diarrhea, it's heavy poisons leading the body.\n\n  \r\nNow, 90% of our diseases today are from pollution, from industrial waste.\n\n Whether it's put in our food as a preservative, as flavoring, no matter what it is, those always have heavy metals combined with them.\n\n \r\nHeavy metals, always involved.\n\n Other chemicals always are involved with some kind of heavy metal, those collect in the body and they create diseases.\n\n Cancer is the biggest.\n\n Dr.\n\n Samuel Epstein who's an octogenarian, he's in his eighties, the world’s greatest expert on cancer says that one out of every two men gets cancer today, and one out of every three women.\n\n \r\nThe medical profession is always blaming microbes.\n\n Microbes are never the problem.\n\n They're just the janitors.\n\n For example, dental decay.\n\n Whenever you get dental decay, the heavy metals are leaving the brain and going out the gums, heavy metals like mercury and lead will etch into dentine, cause abscesses and holes in the dentine.\n\n  \r\nBacteria results to clean out the dead cells, the dead dentine.\n\n If it goes deeper and deeper and the metal keeps holding onto the tooth into the dentine by the vehicle plaque.\n\n It can cause even more damage, unless there's a good quality of plaque.\n\n Now, what the plaque is, is the body takes a lot of calcium potassium and other minerals to bind with those heavy metals that are leaving the brain to keep them from doing heavy damage.\n\n \r\nThat's why you have plaque on your tongue.\n\n That's why you have plaque on your teeth.\n\n The greatest concentration of heavy metals comes from the brain because the brain uses a lot of metallic minerals because it conducts electricity and relays electricity and light through metallic minerals.\n\n When you cook food, you cauterize the minerals, you make all of those heavy metals free radicals, so they can do a lot of damage.\n\n \r\nFree radicals and cauterization means it disassociates.\n\n Let's say all of us were holding hands and we all had a chore to do as long as we held hands everything would be done properly.\n\n When you cook, you fractionate everything, so everybody's bonds separate.\n\n  \r\nSo, that means that a certain toxin can be isolated and they have a tendency to group together.\n\n So, you have mercury clumped together, you have lead clumped together and then you have a dangerous substance and if it kills enough cells around, you have cancer.\n\n  \r\nCancer is nothing other than the body’s the inability to dissolve dead cells, and remove them from the system.\n\n So, they collect and they collect as tumors, or your body takes them to a particular area to dissolve those dead cells.\n\n \r\nAnd the difference between a squamous tumor cell and a basal cell is basal cell is one that dissolves and doesn't necessarily collect as tumors.\n\n Your squamous cells form tumors, and it's nothing but a collection of dead cells.\n\n  \r\nNow, the cancer cell is a very healthy, good cell.\n\n It can sustain itself with very little nutrients and it can live isolated among 50 to 100 dead cells.\n\n \r\nSo, it's like a hermit, like a monk.\n\n Once that cancer cell dies, it sets out a virus, a serum, which is a solvent, which dissolves all the surrounding dead cells.\n\n Since your body can eliminate it, you get rid of tumors like that.\n\n  \r\nWhen you have benign tumors, you don't have any cancer cells in it, so you can never get rid of the tumor quickly, and there's no circulation.\n\n There's no blood vessels into a benign tumor.\n\n So, the dead cells, the mummified cells in a benign tumor, the blood has to work on eating it a little at a time from the outside in.\n\n When you have the cancer cells spread all throughout the tumor, if the cancer cells.\n\n \r\nThey start dissolving the whole tumor and you can get rid of the tumor in two to five days.\n\n May take up to four or five years, depending on the size of the tumor and how quickly your body can get rid of the discarded waste from those dissolved cells.\n\n  \r\nBecause remember those dissolved cells, those dead cells were killed by a chemical, usually some kind of collection of heavy metals.\n\n You can go on the internet; you can look under the particular toxins like cadmium; often creates kidney cancer.\n\n Thalium usually creates breast cancer.\n\n  \r\nSo, you can look at these different cancers and if you know somebody who has cancer and you take a biopsy of it, but you don't have it analyzed the way the medical profession wants it analyzed, you have it analyzed for toxicity, and you'll find out what caused that \r\nif you have someone who has cancer and they're vomiting, or has diarrhea, you could have that analyzed.\n\n To give you an example, I had a woman who had breast cancer and she gained almost enough weight, but she went into a vomiting phase that lasted two and a half months, and it killed her because she just didn't have the weight, she couldn't eat when you’re vomiting in that sort.\n\n \r\nSo, I just had one four-ounce vomit analyzed and the laboratory called me and said, “Somebody's poisoning your patient.\n\n” And I said, \"What do you mean.\n\n” He said, “Well, she has 3000 times the lethal dose of thallium in that four ounces of vomit?\n\n”  \r\nAnd that made me realize how much thallium she must have had her body because she was vomiting about five times a day, sometimes even more for two and a half months.\n\n  \r\nShe was a jewelry maker.\n\n Never wore gloves, never wore a mask, right over the burner.\n\n Breathing in all that stuff, absorbing it into her hands.\n\n Only seven years she did that and it killed her.\n\n She had gained a little bit more weight because we got right to the point where the cancer stopped dissolving, but she just passed away one night at the end of that.\n\n \r\nSo, she made it all the way through to where she stopped producing tumors and at the end of dissolving them and getting rid of them.\n\n But she just couldn't eat, she was so sore in her stomach.\n\n She couldn’t eat from the vomiting.\n\n  \r\nSo, all cancer is created by heavy metals and toxins.\n\n Every disease is created by toxins, not bacteria, not virus, not parasites.\n\n That's the medical profession's blame.\n\n The medical profession is responsible for 70% of all the toxicity that we have and all the diseases that we have, they're responsible for 70% of that 90%.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cancer \n \n \n \n \n### (9) Cancer Doctors Tryign To Scare Her and Dont Fast \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nShe came to me about seven years ago with cancer on the nose\n\n One third of her nose was gone when she came to me, they told her that within a year, her entire bone structure would be gone.\n\n And I said, don't listen to them.\n\n They they're B movie writers from Hollywood, they are not factual people.\n\n \r\nSo, she didn't do a thing.\n\n She had had radiation therapy before she came to me and it came back to her, so this time she decided to do something differently.\n\n So, she was on the diet five years.\n\n At the end of that five years, all of the tumors stopped, stopped growing.\n\n Now the nose started growing and it started growing back on.\n\n \r\nShe had lost two thirds of it by this time, and the doctors told her that within a year, she'd lose all the bone in her entire face.\n\n They wanted to remove all the bone in her face, including the jaw and make a plastic prosthesis and put in a plastic skull.\n\n That's what they wanted to do.\n\n So, she refused to do it.\n\n \r\nSo, on my diet, after five years, she had only lost about three quarters of her nose, and then the cancer stopped.\n\n I went away to Asia and when I came back, she was skinny: diarrhea, vomiting.\n\n Some jerk had convinced her to fat.\n\n Fasted for 20 days, never recovered.\n\n  \r\nThis was at the end.\n\n She had suffered for five years with this nose cancer.\n\n At the end of it, this natural hygienist convinced her to fast and it killed her.\n\n \r\nShe just couldn't eat.\n\n She couldn't catch up.\n\n It's the second time this guy did that.\n\n He used to come to my potlucks and stuff, and then tell everybody on the side, “Oh, you shouldn't be eating the meat and you should only eat fruits and stuff like that.\n\n” \r\nAnd he did it to a lot of people.\n\n He put one of my diabetic 21-year-old girl with his fasting routine in 15 days, had her hospitalized as skinny as a rail, unable to recover.\n\n It took her two years to get out of the hospital.\n\n So, don't listen to that bullshit.\n\n  \r\nDon't do it.\n\n Don't get skinny.\n\n Don't go on fasts.\n\n If you are sick and you've got a problem, fat is your best friend.\n\n Get as fat as you can, as fast as you can.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nWhere's this guy now who pulled your patient aside.\n\n Did you ever do something about it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, I called him up and I told 'em?\n\n I never wanted to see him.\n\n You know, I'm not a fascist.\n\n \r\nBut when you start doing that to my patients, I just say stay away.\n\n So, he tried to come one time and I said, “You're not welcome.\n\n Bye.\n\n” \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Cheese and Dehydrated Foods, Honey Wil Lhelp Ti Digest \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCheese will do it the easiest, because if you have diarrhea, you need a lot that will dry it and hold onto it\n\n So, do not eat honey directly with the cheese for that purpose.\n\n Cheese that's eaten without honey will not digest.\n\n Just remember anything that's dehydrated, your body has to leech enzymes from some other area of the body or other foods that you're eating that are raw and that are fresh, and bind those enzymes to utilize the cheese or any kind of dried food that you would have.\n\n  \r\nSo, dried food is not really a raw food.\n\n If you eat honey with a food that is dried, you will digest it because you're providing enzymes.\n\n But when you want to use cheese as a detoxifier, as a substance to bind with those poisons and move them out of the body, you eat cheese alone.\n\n \r\nWell, you don't eat cheese with honey in the same mouth.\n\n If you’ve had cheese with your meat meal and you've got some sauce with it that has honey in it.\n\n The honey's already bound with the fat in that sauce or in the meat meal.\n\n So, you can eat cheese with that meat meal, but when you put honey and cheese in your mouth together, the body will digest that cheese.\n\n \r\nThat's a good thing.\n\n If you're trying to remineralize the body, you need extra minerals.\n\n If you have osteoporosis or your hair's getting very thin and you're losing it.\n\n You want to eat cheese and honey together twice a day.\n\n  \r\nAbout anywhere from a tablespoon and a half to two tablespoons, with a third honey.\n\n In other words, one tablespoon of cheese to one teaspoon of honey.\n\n \r\nSo, if it's a tablespoon and a half of cheese at a time, it's one and a half teaspoons of honey.\n\n If you're having two tablespoons of cheese, then you have two teaspoons of honey and do that twice a day.\n\n Usually after each meal you'll utilize it the best.\n\n But if you're having an abcessed tooth or having dental pain, or you're having sore joints, you can do it several many times a day until those symptoms are relieved.\n\n \r\nYou have diarrhea or vomit.\n\n You eat the cheese without the honey, most of the time.\n\n You still need two times with the honey a day to make sure you're providing minerals to feed the cells, but to bind with the poisons that are leaving the body in your vomit diarrhea, to slow down the vomit, slow down the diarrhea, the cheese will absorb it, hold onto it like a sponge.\n\n \r\nSo, you have a high mineral content and the body can use calcium, potassium and phosphorus to magnetize, these other poisons, draw them to it.\n\n So, as the blood, the lymphatic and the neurological fluids pass through the digestive tract, the minerals in the cheese will be drawing out those poisons from those three fluid systems.\n\n \r\nIt will hold onto it like a sponge and it will pass right out without digestion, and that's what you want.\n\n That protects the body.\n\n No matter what you do, it’s not going to remove it.\n\n If you did something to stop the detoxification, it's a matter of you stopped the detoxification and it may have been just coincidental that you stopped having diarrhea at that time.\n\n \r\nI don't think people should stop their diarrhea or vomiting, the quicker you get those poisons out the better.\n\n And the only way you can get rid of that heavy of a concentration of poisons, imagine 3000 times the lethal dose.\n\n That means the dose of Thalium that she had in her vomit could have killed 3000 people.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Chemtrails \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nMy question is what do you think of chem busters\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, if they're using plastic resin substances to make them?\n\n The ones that they say are elemental, but they're also using plastic to hold this unit together.\n\n I don't know that they really were, because you're talking about a chemical that spread all throughout the atmosphere.\n\n \r\nIf you want to have a lot of magnets to take care of that.\n\n That would be a huge, you'd have to have a huge electronic magnet to take care of that.\n\n You may take care of your little small environment, but I haven't done any tests with it to say that they work or not.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n Well, okay.\n\n Uh, anyway, I've got papers if anybody wants to take action to go on the computer and type in “call on governor Schwarzenegger” because we have 497 and we need 50,000 signatures to put up JKF.\n\n We wanna clean up our skies and the soil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLet me tee it up for them.\n\n Everybody know what chemtrails are.\n\n \r\nChemtrails, you see all these streak patterns in the sky?\n\n 90% of the clouds that we have are not real clouds, they’re chemical clouds?\n\n The federal government, the military is dumping its waste in the sky because it’s too expensive to put it anywhere else.\n\n  \r\nSo, they are poisoning us with things like barium, cobalt; all these things are byproduct of military industrial complex, building war toys.\n\n And they say that it's to control weather, so we can stop global warming.\n\n They're trying to sell this bullshit for dumping, and of course, Congress is gonna let them do it, If they say it's for the good.\n\n  \r\nThat kind of poisoning breathing it in, it causes plastic particles to collect in the body, it's causing Morgellons diseases.\n\n Magellan's disease are fibers that pass out the skin whole, and if you breathe it in, your body's going to form plastic fibers to get rid of it, because if it dissolves it, the polymers will dissolve your lungs.\n\n \r\nSo, it tries to pass a hole through the skin, and when it comes out, it makes hardened big sores on the skin.\n\n This is gonna get more and more and more prevalent.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nI'm also having lot people up written already on the chemtrail petition.\n\n A few people we're having also breathing difficulties.\n\n That's another sign that's coming from these elements that I'm adding, it’s still going on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAll kinds of respiratory problems.\n\n That's the main problem with these chemicals they’re dropping.\n\n When you have a contrail, a contrail is when you have the heat of your engine pass out into hot moisture, pass out into cold air.\n\n It creates a temporary cloud.\n\n It dissolves within five minutes.\n\n \r\nA chemtrail is a chemical substance, a compound, a collection of vaporized chemicals that stay lodged and don't evaporate.\n\n It's not ice crystals.\n\n As the heated moisture from a hot engine, the jet engine, combustion engine leaves into the sky, the crystals evaporate and go away.\n\n  \r\nThe chemical trails do not dissolve.\n\n They stay in the area and fall down, and all that crap on your cars, that sticky stuff, chemtrails that they're dumping and they're doing it all over.\n\n When I left Patia, that Naval based down there, the U.\n\nS.\n\n government was visiting them.\n\n Guess what they started doing.\n\n \r\nChemtrails all over Patia, all over the area?\n\n First time I saw 'em in Thailand.\n\n So, the U.\n\nS.\n\n government has them doing it in Thailand now.\n\n So, it's happening all over the fricking world now.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAlso, that pink I learned about in the image on the new chemtrail site, that it's ethylene dibromide.\n\n It's another chemical like the pink you see up there now.\n\n What my dentist said, Dr.\n\n Shinard, that's a pesticide they're using that they use, it's a very toxic on strawberries, ethylene dibromide.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, ethylene dibromide is a byproduct of making certain weapons.\n\n The military is in bed with Dow Chemical, Monsanto, and said, find the use for this, so they don't have to bury it and store it.\n\n So, then they'll make it into some kind of poison pesticide.\n\n Of course, there's a poison, of course it's gonna kill, insects and toads or whatever, birds.\n\n Of course, it's going to kill them and it's in our food, it's going to kill us.\n\n So, you have to really look at what's happening.\n\n \r\nSo, anyway, the whole thing about this is you can go online and sign the petition against chemtrails and weather modification.\n\n Anything that's about weather modification is looking for the rights to do that to us, to poison us.\n\n Right now, they don't have Congress's permission to do it, so they're doing it illegally.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd we're gonna do an educational forum sometime in January.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nKathy, this isn't the form for that.\n\n So, if you have people who want to get in touch with you, have them email you.\n\n You give out your email address, they'll email you, and then you can send them everything.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n Anybody want it cause I'm gonna be leaving soon.\n\n Everybody wants a petition papers.\n\n  \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (12) Coconut Cream Detox \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nI've got a tooth here that has been dead, but the root going to it is not dead\n\n And that tooth has no tooth cause I lost the tooth down here that was next to it.\n\n So, it just keeps going down and down and down.\n\n So, I decided, okay, I'm gonna get rid of it quickly.\n\n So, I started consuming coconut cream with every glass of milk, and I drink two quarts of milk a day right now just to put on enough weight.\n\n  \r\nSo, I've been putting coconut cream in every bit of milk that I drink.\n\n Plus I have about four ounces with a fruit in the afternoon.\n\n I have got pain today and a breakout from it, this tooth, because I did it for two weeks.\n\n I overdid it, every time I push, I suffer.\n\n So, I don't suggest other people do it.\n\n \r\nThe body is always detoxifying, and if you do that one detoxification meal a day with coconut cream.\n\n That's all that's necessary.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Damage From Emrcury \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nWho were on a regular diet, but because she was eating the primal diet it didn't kill her\n\n And she was detoxing that all day long for two and a half months.\n\n And just to give you an idea, you know what three and a half times a lethal dose of Thallium is.\n\n It's in a pinhead?\n\n \r\nThat much mercury, you could kill 5,000 people.\n\n That's on a pin head, that much mercury, it can do that much damage.\n\n And if you really wanna see what it does to actual neurons, you go to the University of Toronto's website and you put in mercury neurology, and then you'll come up with, they actually do a time lapse photography.\n\n \r\nYou see the neurons all growing, and these are actual neurons, and they drop a 2% solution of thimerosal, liquid mercury in it, which they using in vaccines.\n\n And you see the neurons just fragment, just disappear like they had leprosy, disappear.\n\n Just like that.\n\n That's how lethal it is.\n\n  \r\nSo, in order to control toxins in your body, they have to be removed, either through perspiration, vomit diarrhea, out the feces, out the tear ducts the gums, the tongue, the salivary glands, the ear wax, wherever it can discharge, it will.\n\n  \r\nA lot of times your body will build it into your hair, into the nails, and you’ll have ridges in your nails.\n\n Some of them very large and very dry.\n\n You could have very dry and thin hair from that, or even white hair from discarding lead and aluminum and mercury out through the scalp.\n\n It'll turn your hair grey.\n\n  \r\nSo, whenever you have that kind of symptom, you want to increase your intake of cheese, both with, and without honey, because you're very mineral deficient.\n\n Your body's using a lot of good minerals, like calcium is the most concentrated to bind into those poisons, to keep them from doing damage in your body.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Diarrhea \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOnce the diarrhea stops naturally, you can usually go right back into it\n\n If you still have symptoms of it, you just get diarrhea from going onto the regular diet, just go back into eat cheese and, and eggs or whatever it is that gets you through it, the diarrhea.\n\n And you just keep going back to the diet, until you can hold it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay, and that includes even the milks with the fats because once you have that kind of concentrated diarrhea, the enzymes and so forth are, are not there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends on what it is.\n\n A lot of people can drink milk when they’re having diarrhea.\n\n It’ll help stop their diarrhea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, so I’m the opposite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n Well, not the opposite's, just the particular kind of toxins that you were removing.\n\n \r\nAll the calcium, phosphorus  sulfur in milk naturally will pull even more poisons out if there's some kinds of poisons.\n\n Like if the milk did that, then you probably are dumping a lot of toxic sulfur.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Dried Herbs Contain Metals. Medication Poison Body \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n \r\nJust remember that any dried substance, including herbs are dried substances that are very acidic\n\n They have no enzymes in them, no active biological enzymes in them.\n\n Your body will have to leach them from itself and provide them for that particular herb.\n\n  \r\nSo, it's always best to get fresh herbs and juice them.\n\n That is the only way to get the most out of any herb.\n\n And those are wonderful, those are fine.\n\n But just make sure they're never more than 5% of the juice, because those are herbs that are medicinal are very, very active and they can cause you too much detoxification at one time, so you have to be careful.\n\n \r\nAny of those that you have to steep or heat, it's gonna be very acidic and all the heavy metals- remember any vegetable is high in minerals, trace toxic minerals, cyanide, arsenic, lead, mercury.\n\n Every vegetable in this world contains them.\n\n Medicinal herbs contain a higher amount than any other vegetable.\n\n  \r\nSo, when you cook that, you've fractionated and released those as free radicals to do harm in your body.\n\n That's how they work.\n\n Just like medication, they poison the body, the body stops detoxification.\n\n It does not do it in a healthful way.\n\n Sure, it relieves the symptom, and as long as you're gonna have a short life, what the heck, who cares.\n\n But if you wanna live a healthy, long life, don't approach health that way with herbs and medication?\n\n \r\nIf you're good at suicide, that's great.\n\n When it gets to that point where it gets uncomfortable and you blow your brain out and you don't have to worry about it, but that's your choice.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Dry Skin Or Skin Problems Is Toxins Withou Tenough Fat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nUsually somebody who has eczema or psoriasis or skin cancer, does not make the proper fats, the proper cholesterols to feed the skin and connective tissue\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs shingles the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShingles would be the same?\n\n Any kind of dry skin disorder or any kind of skin disorder at all is a result of having toxins emitting through the skin without enough fats to make the white blood cells or the fat cells to harness that poison as it passes through the skin and it bursts and damages the skin on its way out and it gets crusty and dry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about psoriasis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPsoriasis, I said the same thing?\n\n So, if you even put coconut cream directly on that area and that'll provide both water soluble and fat-soluble fats to help protect your tissue.\n\n \r\nBoth cutaneously and subcutaneously.\n\n That's the thing I've been working with a lot in the last year, and it's made a big change and a big difference for a lot of people.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Eczema \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n \r\nWhat causes eczema, and also, how do you eliminate eczema\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEczema is when the toxins go out through the skin and you don't have enough fats in the skin to deal with it?\n\n So, I say, you’re too thin.\n\n  \r\nEverybody I know who has eczema that is non-stoppable is somebody who's underweight or very dry.\n\n They may be fat with water weight, a lot of water retention, but no fat in their tissue.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Egg Weight Loss \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you want to gain weight, you have to eat eggs with other foods\n\n If you eat eggs alone, you will lose weight.\n\n I don't care if you eat 50 a day.\n\n It will cause you to lose weight.\n\n  \r\nSo, do not eat any eggs alone if you want to gain weight, unless you've got a digestion problem and that digestion problem needs to be corrected, and I suggest it for you.\n\n If you have any kind of a severe intestinal problem, ulcer, you have Crohn's disease.\n\n Eggs by themselves are going to be very important, but you better be eating 30 to 50 a day, and plus you'll have some of them in a milkshake to gain weight and it will correct your problem quickly.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Egg Whites, Fat Digestions \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n \r\nHe told me I need to put a lot of weight and put me on a diet that average like 16, 18 eggs a day, something like that\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's all.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\n\n \r\nSo, I was going at it and I got up to 10, 12 eggs a day, and actually I put 30 pounds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCongratulations.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI actually have energy for the first time in my life.\n\n \r\nAnd I've been trying lots of things, so that works pretty well.\n\n So, of course I'm doing mad amounts of research and reading all the time and came across these articles written by Dr.\n\n Mercola and whatnot, and he actually mentioned you in one of them, but he says that he's doing his own research.\n\n \r\nHe found that there's something called avidin in egg white.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBinds with biotin in the test tube.\n\n It doesn't do it in the human body.\n\n Like I said, and it says it in the book, I address that under eggs.\n\n It says that the biotin mixes with avidin to make a solvent, a cleanser of biocarbon's.\n\n So, the more biocarbon you have, the more biotin and the more avidin you need bound together.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBiocarbon's.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen your body uses oxygen and utilizes your nutrient, biocarbon are a carbon, you know, we don't really burn like a spark plug?\n\n We don't burn fats.\n\n We utilize them in a chemical change and it provides a certain amount of energy.\n\n  \r\nWhen we've used/exhausted that chemical structure of that fat, we've got biocarbons and those need to be eliminated.\n\n They need to be neutralized and eliminated, and that combination helps.\n\n  \r\nSee the problem is that Marcola and all the other scientists are not scientists.\n\n They're researchers.\n\n I have dealt with raw eggs extensively since 1976, and it is never created a bio, a biotin deficiency.\n\n Now one patient has ever gotten it after being on the diet.\n\n \r\nThey come to me with biotin de.\n\n What could be addressed as biotin deficiency.\n\n He lots of the raw eggs with, uh, egg yolk and, and the egg white together never have a deficiency.\n\n So this is all theoretical Mercola.\n\n Doesn't know his as from whole.\n\n He is new to this.\n\n He's only four years into this.\n\n He's even one of my patients and he's new to this.\n\n \r\nHe doesn't know anything first.\n\n So, whatever thinks he thinks looks good is what he adapts to.\n\n And he's lying about his research.\n\n So the biopsying efficiency in the first place, see what does that look like.\n\n  there, it depends upon the individual?\n\n It can create many effects and I'm not gonna go into it here because that sun will never get through.\n\n \r\nIf I start address.\n\n Deficiencies, but you can look up in any kind of book, nutritional Almanac.\n\n You can look up a wood, biotin deficiencies are on the internet.\n\n Okay.\n\n So eat your egg together.\n\n Don't eat them alone.\n\n Cuz then biocarbon will remain in your body and you won't get well, look at Marco.\n\n He doesn't do what I tell him to do.\n\n \r\nWhat happens.\n\n He gets skinnier and he's more he's so hyperactive, look at this video.\n\n I mean, it's just like this.\n\n When he, when my diet was staying on it heavily, he was calm, contemplative, thoughtful, you know, he's just eating lots of fruit and he's doing all these super foods that are hyper up and he's not rational anymore.\n\n \r\nHe's not common and collected.\n\n It's a shame.\n\n He saying you should eat eggs with other fruits, not eatable.\n\n No he's saying eat the whites.\n\n The you white in the AIO together because he suggests you eat them separately.\n\n Okay.\n\n Because they buy it in evident combination.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Food Routien and How Much Juice \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFollowing the typical daily food routine, taking my cup of juice and then doing the cycle of meat\n\n And what if the cycle of meat and the cycle of milkshakes- suppose I'm not that hungry that day, and I've had only two cups of juice and I don't care for anymore.\n\n\r\nI mean, is that all my body needs for the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou get 50 demerits?\n\n\r\nEverybody can vacillate on that particular diet.\n\n The diets that I give in the recipe book on pages 40, through 42, those are guidelines that you should stick to 90% of the time.\n\n There are times when I will have nothing but milk all day, milk and honey, other days when I eat three pounds of meat a day and very little juice.\n\n \r\nI go on whatever is happening in my body.\n\n When you go through all the remedy sections and you read what things are good for, then you know how to adjust your diet with the symptoms that you're having, that you're experiencing.\n\n Then you can be assured that even though you're not following the natural main guidelines that I've presented for you, you are still helping your body because you're addressing the particular needs that it has at that particular time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Go To Tropical Environment For Healing \n \n \n \n \n### (22) Heat & Cheese &minerals \n \n**[2006]**\n\r\nYeah\n\n What your body did was burn that whole area out.\n\n See, whenever you have a pain anywhere, you have swelling, that swelling is concentrating nutrients into the area.\n\n It's the surrounding tendons, bones are not relaxing and opening up and it will create a pressure in there.\n\n You use heat in the area and you eat cheese and honey together, you get the minerals in, you don't take MSM because then you burn the tissue.\n\n\r\nAnd then when you detox there again next time it's going to be twice as bad and you're going to get blisters and burns to come out your knee.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Heavy Metals In Sperm \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHear that on the AOL report that came out that male sperm reduces breast cancer\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's why women should swallow\r\nBut, that's not necessarily true.\n\n If your man has heavy metals in the prostate gland or in the testes, you're gonna get heavy metals in that sperm.\n\n When a couple comes to me and I see heavy metals in those areas, I say, do not swallow.\n\n You'll see the man and he's going *imitation*.\n\n I said, you wanna poison her.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, heavy metals in the sperm will probably affect pregnancy too?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah?\n\n It'll cause many deformities and malnourished children, all kinds of problems.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo then how, how does one, like what's a prenatal diet look like then to prepare men and woman.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if the female is healthy enough, she can change that genetic structure from the male to get rid of it at an early stage, within the first month as the fetus develops if she's on a proper diet?\n\n Now I have women that get a lot of toxicity stored in one ovary.\n\n\r\nAnd I say the ovum, you do not wanna get pregnant with that ovum.\n\n You probably will have a deformed baby or retarded baby.\n\n So, usually a woman can tell which side she's ovulating on.\n\n So, if she wants to get pregnant, she ovulates and gets pregnant or tries to get pregnant on the month where she's ovulating from that ovary, the safe one.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Honey Degrees \n \n \n \n \n### (25) How Many Cancer Patients, Coconut Cream More Than Oils \n \n \n \n \n### (26) Lime & Clay To Draw Posions Fro Mabcess \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSince the book has been written, well rewritten, I still had the lime in the last rewrite\n\n So, you put lime first and then you put clay on it to draw out the poisons from the abscess.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou put the clay on or you cover it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou cover it?\n\n You have to keep it moist.\n\n If it dries out, it's going to cause your skin all around the area to dry out, and then the abscess may go to the whole area if the skin's too dry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about taking a shower, and all that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTake a shower and then put it on and then leave it for that 24 hours?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen it dries do you-\r\n\n\r\nYou don't let it dry.\n\n You put the clay on, take a piece of plastic that's exactly the size of the clay pack, put that over it, and then wrap that around with like an ACE bandage to keep it from drying out.\n\n Don't let it dry out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how long do you apply it.\n\n Do you just wait till the abscess subsides?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Well, you might let it breathe overnight, and keep it on during the day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAfter my brother took the clay, right away just within 10-15 minutes it started to break open.\n\n Do you wait for it to do it naturally, or can you squeeze it to help come out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's okay to do that?\n\n Most of the abscesses like that are so heavy in toxins, your body won't reabsorb those white blood cells.\n\n\r\nWhen I do it now, I won't do it because my body will have an abscess and then the body will be able to utilize those white blood cells that went in to protect it.\n\n So, I don't lose those white.\n\n So, they don't just dry on the skin and fall off.\n\n But in people who are just getting onto the diet, the concentration of poisons are usually so absorbed into the white cells, it's not good to reabsorb them.\n\n So breaking it open and letting it puss right away is fine.\n\n Even though you're losing hundreds of thousands of white blood cells in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre you putting any sort of antiseptic or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLime juice is the only natural antiseptic that's easily gotten?\n\n Lemon juice is not, lemon juice does just the opposite.\n\n\r\nLemon juice encourages bacteria and fermentation.\n\n Lime juice destroys fermentation, destroys bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when it's dry, you just put mineral water on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you've got that piece of plastic in there, it's not going to dry and the bandage over that, it won't dry?\n\n Just don't let the plastic touch your skin.\n\n Just have it covering the clay.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Magnetic Therapy \n \n**[2006],[Jim]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWould a serious health seeker on the diet have any reason to look into magnets that they sleep on\n\n Or is there something to that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I experimented with magnetic therapy from 1989 to 1992 with Nikken magnets?\n\n Slept on their beds, I used their patches and pads.\n\n Wverything experimenting with them with probably about only 23 people consistently, 25 people agreed two, two  didn't do it, you know, systematically to be able to follow it.\n\n But 23 people, I followed, I was one of those people and I found that if I used the bed for more than five hours a day, more than six weeks at a time, it did just the opposite, caused problems.\n\n\r\nAnd then people who used it, after six weeks, they'd stop using it for maybe five to 10 weeks could use it again for maybe two or three weeks and you could do it on and off like that.\n\n But to put that mattress between your pads your mattresses in your bed is a chore.\n\n\r\nEverybody is so lazy these days.\n\n Taking 20 more minutes out of your life to do those changes, it's easier just to leave something and deal with the ill consequences, because that's what I've seen.\n\n So, you have to use those very particularly, what they do is, now in the laboratory tests of Nikken and my tests, you have a polar opposite.\n\n\r\nYou have the positive and the negative side, and they're supposed to alternate in this pattern.\n\n But every one of the Nikken pads I've had, that I've tested, all had one side was magnetic, the other side's negative.\n\n That doesn't go anything with what their research says to do.\n\n \r\nSo, I took all of their magnets in the bed, I ripped them out, re-glued them in and they showed all the patterns in their tests were circular.\n\n In their bed, they're running perpendicular, parallel with your body.\n\n Same length with your body.\n\n You're lying on your bed, up and down.\n\n \r\nSo, I made mine into a circle, three circles, concentrated circles, and each one of 'em were alternating, worked a lot better, but still I was only able to use 'em for so many hours.\n\n It became better and more powerful in less time.\n\n But nobody makes them and produces them that way.\n\n Anybody wants to make a lot of money.\n\n They can do it that way, start producing these magnets, but the cost would be extraordinary.\n\n\r\nThey're already very expensive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat were the benefits that you got though when you did it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what they do is I, I was gonna go into that?\n\n What they do is if you've got heavy metals bound and locked together in the body, they want the positive, and will start pulling positive protons out of the tissue, out of the electromagnetic fields.\n\n If you have a negative, it pulls its electrons out.\n\n So, what happens is if you're imbalanced proton or neutron wise, it'll supply the ones that are missing, get them moving in the body, circulating.\n\n Now for some people that can cause a lot of problems.\n\n\r\nIt's like getting a lot of heavy metals and toxins going and you don't have the proper nutrients in the body.\n\n If you're skinny, don't get near them.\n\n If you're go overweight, okay.\n\n Your body will have the fats right there to bind.\n\n So, if you're overweight, you can use magnets safely.\n\n If you're not overweight and thin use 'em for only 20 minutes, 15 minutes at a time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Milk Minerals, Gas, Cream and Honey Add, Cold Milk \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's detoxification\n\n Like I said, milk is very high in minerals, especially calcium.\n\n And just like in the cheese, those minerals will draw the poisons out of the circulatory systems as they pass through the digestive tract.\n\n  \r\nWhen they form with digestive acids, they can cause gases.\n\n \r\nSo, what you might do is add a little bit more cream to your milk and that'll reduce the amount of gas.\n\n And a little bit more honey, or start eating honey with it too to help you digest it better.\n\n Then you can convert those gasses into a neutralized substance.\n\n  \r\nNever drink milk cold, unless you've already made it into kefir or yogurt, then it's already predigested.\n\n Then you don't have to worry about it.\n\n If you drink cold milk, the cold milk goes into the stomach, causes the stomach to contract.\n\n It's cold, just like when you contract, and shiver.\n\n The stomach contracts, no hydrochloric acid is formed and dumps into the stomach, as long as that stomach is contracted, unless you're an Eskimo and used to it.\n\n  \r\nThey do, they'll immediately produce the hydrochloric acid, but we don't, they've been on raw foods all their lives too.\n\n So, the milk will go from the first part of the stomach to the second part, the duodenum to be absorbed without the casein, some of the milk protein, and the lactase, some of the milk sugar's being digested.\n\n They go right into the blood undigested and cause allergic reaction, even though you don't notice it, don't recognize it.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you want to drink cold milk to cool you during the summer, you make sure it's kefir or yogurt, already predigested, so then you can deal with that contracted stomach and then the milk's already digested by the time it gets into duodenum.\n\n \r\nSo, there's no problem, but fresh milk, do not drink it cold, unless it's an ounce, ounce and a half of the time, just to cool your system a little bit, your body's gonna have that warm quickly before it goes into the duodenum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen you leave it in the refrigerator, you can just leave it out for a few hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUsually five hours, take it out five hours before, unless you just want to put it in a bowl of hot water?\n\n Soon as it gets warm, you can drink it.\n\n  \r\nNo wonder you're having problems because if you don't digest the casein properly and the lactase, you're not gonna digest the minerals properly, cuz you're gonna use a lot of minerals to bind with those unadjusted nutrients, and you're gonna have joint problems cause it's going to cause mineral deficiencies.\n\n So, make sure it's kefir or yogurt before you drink it cold.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Moldy Cheese, Milk \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt tastes sour\n\n It's not spoiled, nothing raw spoils or petrified.\n\n It just turns into a more sour product.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd can that sour product make you over acidic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFine?\n\n It's just predigested, the older it is the more predigested it is.\n\n Cheese is a mold.\n\n Cheeses are made with molds.\n\n \r\nSo, you have a mold, a fungus eating the dairy, and that provides other kinds of nutrients.\n\n Great to get rid of penicillin and antibiotics because that fungus will go in and eat the bad molds from the antibiotic.\n\n Remember antibiotics are grown on grains.\n\n That's a bird mold, that doesn't belong in our body.\n\n \r\nSo, we want a mold that from an animal product, that is natural to us.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Msm & Supplements \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey used to give sulfur and they still do give sulfur drugs for people who have kidney infections, bladder infections, for edema\n\n MSM, a lot of people are taking the supplement MSM.\n\n That's sulfur folks, sulfur dries out the body.\n\n They make matches with sulfur.\n\n You can get burns, you can burn your intestines, burn your whole body tissue, burn your brain because of that.\n\n\r\nSulfur.\n\n When a mineral, when it's in a food, the plant has taken that and made it into a nutritive substance.\n\n Once you isolate it, it is rock again, and it will do damage.\n\n Just like if you ate lye.\n\n If you ate cement, what would happen.\n\n It would just burn and eat into your intestines all the way through, you'd have severe diarrhea or vomit?\n\n\r\nThat is what concentrated minerals do.\n\n That's what plants eat, we don't.\n\n We eat minerals that is combined in a whole nutrient nutritive combination, a whole smorgasbord of nutrients.\n\n It isn't just minerals, isolated minerals.\n\n There's always a coupling of different vitamins of enzymes and fats, all coupled with every mineral.\n\n\r\nSo, when the body opens up and it tracks in a mineral, that's got 30 other nutrients along with it, minimum.\n\n So, the body gets like this.\n\n You have a smorgasbord of nutrients to eat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Negatives Of High Blood Pressure \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs there a downside to high blood pressure\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are two things that people who have high blood pressure have to watch?\n\n They get low blood sugar very radically, cause it takes a lot of nutrients to run the blood pressure that high cause the heart muscle has to pump that much stronger and harder.\n\n It's like weight lifting.\n\n \r\nSo, you need more nutrients.\n\n You need to eat honey more often.\n\n You need to eat meat more often to get the pyruvate, the protein sugars to strengthen and build the, the heart muscle.\n\n If you get low blood nutrient value, you're going to get dizzy if you stand up quickly, you're going to get dizzy and even fading spells if you do too much and your blood nutrient level gets too low.\n\n The medical profession loves to say low blood sugar, forget low blood sugars, low protein, low fat level.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what do they have to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEat more frequently?\n\n You have to eat every two hours, eat or drink something.\n\n If you do my schedule in the books, in the recipe book, you're eating every two to three hours.\n\n This is perfect for that.\n\n And eat that schedule just as it applies in there.\n\n But eat schedule eating plan one, where you eat three meat meals a day.\n\n\r\nSo, break your meat meals up into three instead of two a day, and then you should be fine.\n\n Just eat a lot of honey.\n\n You need those enzymes to make sure you digest everything quickly to supply the heart with enough nutrient.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you eat honey by itself or with something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny way you want it?\n\n With or without.\n\n\r\nJust make it two tablespoons of honey to one table spoon of butter.\n\n Another thing, if you have high blood pressure that means you probably have clogged arteries, you've got plaque on your arterial walls.\n\n \r\nEating coconut cream and honey/butter.\n\n So, you could use.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\ntwo tablespoons of coconut cream\r\ntwo tablespoons of butter\r\ntwo tablespoons or three tablespoons of honey.\n\n That mixture will help clean out your art.\n\n Coconut cream will help clean out the art.\n\n\r\n\r\nThat mixture will help clean out your arteries.\n\n Coconut cream will help clean out the arteries.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) People Got Sick On Crise Ship \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI was curious why everyone got sick on the cruise ship a couple of weeks ago, on one cruise ship, 750 people all got sick at the same time\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're starting to practice new food preservative methods and you know, all those ships, they get some of the most processed foods like they do in hospitals.\n\n\r\nSo, heavy chemicals in them, and they're starting to use a new virus.\n\n Five new viruses that attack bacteria.\n\n And if they're attacking bacteria in the meat, you know they're gonna attack the digestive bacteria in your intestines.\n\n People are gonna get very sick from this and the FDA approved it two months ago and they've already started using it.\n\n\r\nAnd especially for prepackaged, premade foods, meats, for meats.\n\n So, that's what they got.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, don't go on cruise ships.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUnless you take your own food with you?\n\n I did a commercial for Club Med and they gave me a whole vacation package free.\n\n I took my own food.\n\n Absolutely took my own food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe viruses for making the chemical.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Those viruses that they are spraying on these meats to preserve will attack the bacteria, the digestive bacteria in your body that digests the meat.\n\n So, it's gonna prevent you from digesting properly, and especially if it's cooked, it's going to putrefy.\n\n The meat's gonna putrefy more.\n\n\r\nSo, people are gonna get diarrhea, vomit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFrozen meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, it'll just be any kind of lunch meat or pre-prepared meat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust on the ships.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, we're doing this happening in a lot of places, but they may have sprayed too much on, the company who did the catering is responsible, but of course they're gonna blame something else?\n\n\r\nThey're gonna blame some bacteria.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Skinny People and Vit C \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHe used citric acid\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n  Skinny as a rail, hyperactive and not a pleasant man to be around?\n\n And that's why I put in there in my book, I says it causes all kinds of psychological side effects.\n\n It rips the fat out of your system.\n\n\r\nSo, where does your body go to get the fat.\n\n And it goes into the myelin sheath of your nerves?\n\n Put your nerves on end, you're at edge all the time and who are the most difficult people to get along with, skinny people.\n\n Hyperactive, and they go off the wall all the time and it's difficult.\n\n So, it's very difficult.\n\n\r\nSo, vitamin C is not a good thing, and vitamin C poisoned people.\n\n That's how it got them to stop having their symptoms.\n\n It wasn't a beneficial way.\n\n I can get a child to behave by beating the shit out of him.\n\n But that doesn't mean the child grows up to be a good individual.\n\n He'll solve his problems with violence, just like I taught him violence.\n\n\r\nAnd when you take vitamin C, that's what happens.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Sulhpur and Supplements \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMSM, you were saying something sort of a negative about it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMSM is a sulfur?\n\n It's an isolated sulfur, concentrated sulfur.\n\n Anytime you have a concentrated mineral, it causes an imbalance of all the other minerals in the body, especially calcium, potassium and phosphorus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, supposedly it's good for the joints and things like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it burns and dries out any kind of virus that's trying to clean the joint.\n\n So, you're going to get stiffer as you get older and you're likely to have cartilage deterioration.\n\n Now, MSM has only been around for about 12 years on a large basis, and the effects of it will be show up in another 15 years.\n\n \r\nJust like when they started to use sulfur as an antibiotic when I was a child.\n\n They had to stop.\n\n They're still using it, but not like they used to, they used to give it for everything, and they found that people were poisoning.\n\n  \r\nIn 1969, 60 minutes did an episode showing three women who spontaneously combust.\n\n Neither of 'em were around any flames at the time, and one woman burned three quarter, 75% of her body.\n\n Another woman burned one half of her body and the other one burned one third of her body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nFrom the inside, are you talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, just went on flames in the skin?\n\n The clothes went up in flames, everything went up and there, there was no cause of it.\n\n \r\nSo, I was studying chemistry at the time, and I thought, okay, we make matches out of sulfur.\n\n It's very easy to ignite it with one spark.\n\n Just think if the body uses converts it to like a nitroglycerin, we have natural nitroglycerin in the body all the time.\n\n What if it got to a point and mixed with sulfur and came out the skin.\n\n \r\nIt could cause that kind of a spontaneous combustion?\n\n So, I was very sick at the time still, and I couldn't work, so I was acting cuz you just sit around on a set, get up and say your lines and got paid a lot of money.\n\n And I had an agent who was the head of publicity to MGM.\n\n So, I got him to get ahold of the producers and they gave me the women's names and I wrote them and then got to talk with them on the phone.\n\n  \r\nThe woman who got three quarters of her body burned had been taking sulfur for 32 years for kidney damage, kidney problems.\n\n The next woman who burned half of her body had been taking it 22 years.\n\n The woman who burned one third of her body, 12 years, can you imagine 12, 22, 32 is always on the twos could be some kind of a biological cycle in some people that produce it every 12-year period.\n\n  \r\nIn these particular women, it came to that effect and the sulfur burned the body.\n\n So, you never know what sulfur can do, but sulfur is always used to dry out the body, and it burns when it's mixed with a fluid solution, it burns in the body, causes irritations.\n\n Causes all kinds of problems.\n\n  \r\nSo, people with joint pains, certainly.\n\n It's going to draw up the swelling, the natural swelling in there that's to provide more fresh nutrients to cleanse that area and heal it is being eliminated by the sulfur.\n\n Of course, the symptom goes away.\n\n Oh, I'm better.\n\n I'm healthy.\n\n No, you're not, because now what's the sulfur that's deposited there going to do, is it going to dissolve the cartilage.\n\n \r\nIs it going to harden the tendons and arteries, certainly will?\n\n So.\n\n you can spend for your latter years going around like this.\n\n Stiff as can be \r\nWell, Charlie Chaplin was like this.\n\n \r\nHe was a loose problem.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Supplements Are Toxic \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut you don't want any kind of vitamin supplement\n\n It's not really a b-vitamin.\n\n Let me give you an example, two examples.\n\n Vitamin E, that you buy out there.\n\n 99.\n\n9% of all the vitamin E comes from Kodak and Fuji.\n\n It is their developing solution.\n\n It used to cost them hundreds of millions of dollars a year to take that solution, bury it in bunkers that were concrete walls, 12, inches thick and they have to contain it in stainless steel barrels, millions of dollars in land and development, and all of that.\n\n\r\nOne of their scientists did a comparison of chemical structure who found that solution, that chemical in there, the main ingredient of it, the most toxic substances was 73% identical to the structure of vitamin E.\n\n So, he convinced them to sell it as vitamin E.\n\n Now they make a bundle on it and everybody's eating this solvent, this chemical solvent as vitamin E.\n\n\r\nAnd the difference is what they did was decided to call there substance as alpha tocopherol, d-alpha tocopherol is the complete vitamin E structure and that's still almost 30% difference, and it has nothing to do with the natural.\n\n \r\nSame with vitamin C.\n\n Once you isolate vitamin C from a food, even if it isn't chemical and ascorbic acid, the structure is entirely different.\n\n\r\nVitamin C in food looks like little soft spongy little balls, which are incontestably very small and soft, looked like they're little, hairy spongy little balls that a child would play with in various colors.\n\n They're like mutated pastel colors, very colorful and very soft.\n\n \r\nVitamin C in any form under a same kind of microscope will show you a hundred times the size of those balls and there's like broken glass.\n\n Looks like a broken mirror, has no relationship to what vitamin C is.\n\n Ascorbic acid has no relationship to vitamin C at all in food.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Tired From Detox Is Healing, Aajonus Sleeps \n \n**[2006],[Fred]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDetoxifying, and you're like really tired\n\n What, what causes the tiredness.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUsually, people with gray hair get that problem *laughs*?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nSo, if I dye it.\n\n \r\nI'll go get some Clorox?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAny time you get sleepy like that, the body is in a healing state.\n\n**[unclear]**\n who can get into a very relaxed way without being in a sleep space, to go into cellular division like that.\n\n  \r\nSo, you need to sleep when you're healing.\n\n When I go into a sleepy spell, normally I sleep three and a half to five hours of sleep a day.\n\n If I go into a sleepy period where I almost sleep six to seven hours a day, sometimes more, I'll increase my meat to make sure that I'm providing that protein for cellular de division and I'll eat up to three pounds of meat a day when I get sleepy.\n\n \r\nSo, sleep, enjoy the sleeping.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nBut in the summer hours, like working three hours and the rest of the time I was in bed.\n\n \r\n[Aajonus \r\nYou needed heal.\n\n Do a lot of

every hour after five hours that you don't eat something with protein in it, your body will eat 1 - 1.\n\n5 tablespoons of red blood cells.\n\n \r\nSo, if you sleep 8 hours without eating, you're consuming 3 - 4 tablespoons of red blood cells, that means you awaken with anemia.\n\n That's about all you produce in a 24 hour period is 3 - 4 tablespoons of red blood cells.\n\n So, you're eating it up every night.\n\n So, you need to wake up after 3, 4, 5 hours, eat something with protein in, I don't care if it's milk, egg, meat, whatever it is, then go back to sleep for 3, 4, 5 hours.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're fasting, those people who go one day, 24 hours, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, if you do really something stupid and go 42 days like I did, it'll take you 2.\n\n5 - 3 years to recover.\n\n When I did the 42 day fast, even though I drank my urine during there to recycle those proteins, it still took me 2.\n\n5 years to recover.\n\n\r\nWhen I did a 27 day fast of only water, it took me 5 years to recover.\n\n So, you have to be very careful about fasting, it's not a good thing.\n\n You can eat small amounts if you want to make sure the body's getting rid of enough toxicity, don't do that in the winter.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Wont Drink Kefir, Toxic Fats \n \n \n \n \n### (3) Bone Marrow, Stem Cells Can Becomee Any Part Of Body \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBone marrow, best ways to eat it and all the benefits of bone marrow\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n She has a question about bone marrow, how to eat it, what does it do.\n\n Bone marrow, besides sperm and ovum, is the only place where you can get nonspecific stem cells?\n\n Stem cells that can become any kind of cell in your body.\n\n\r\nYou have adult stem cells in everything else in all the meats that you get that are particular to that.\n\n Like you have stem cells in heart muscle, so if you eat heart, you'll get the stem cells that are particular for heart, and they'll help you generate your own heart muscles, liver, everything else.\n\n\r\nBut bone marrow has nonspecific.\n\n They are shape shifters.\n\n They can address and make any cell that's needed in the body, and it's good to eat it with meat to okay have an extra supply of protein there to be able to assimilate those stem cells and feed those stem cells so that they can reproduce and grow a little bit quicker.\n\n\r\nAny kind of meat, chicken.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter?\n\n Any kind of meat, it could be fish, doesn't matter.\n\n Doesn't matter where the bone marrow comes from.\n\n It should be a healthy animal.\n\n It shouldn't be fed antibiotics or given injections.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'll grow new bone in your body a lot quicker.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDoesn't necessarily have to be totally organic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it doesn't have to be totally organic, but it should not have any hormones or antibiotics?\n\n\r\nWell, what I do is I buy 5 of them a week and then I'll have 1 every day for 5 days with a meat meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould you eat bone marrow with a specific meat like heart and liver.\n\n Does that produce more liver stem cells?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, if you eat it with liver, it'll stimulate more liver cells?\n\n\r\nDid everybody get that.\n\n He asked if you eat the bone marrow with liver, does it help reproduce more liver cells?\n\n Yes, it does?\n\n Whatever adult stem cells you have, when you have the bone marrow with whatever meat that is, it's going to help that particular part of your body.\n\n So, if it's muscle you want you can put on more muscle and you don't necessarily necessarily have to work out if you've been on it as long as I have.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Chemtrails Everywhere \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs there a space that- cuz I can very easily move\n\n I was just thinking of the chemtrails.\n\n I see 'em all around here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHawaii's the only place I haven't seen them.\n\n \r\nEverywhere else in the world I found them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat are chemtrails.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe military is dumping its waste and experimenting on u, biochemically, you'll see these streaks in the sky created by planes?\n\n They're not contrails, contrails are vapor or moisture that gets frozen and it dissolves within 5, 10 minutes.\n\n\r\nThese things hang around for 24 hours, until it just falls on everybody on the ground, those are chemtrails.\n\n They're doing it everywhere.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Cognitive Function \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor cognitive functions to improve, is fish really good\n\n And if so, what type of fish is better than the others?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of fish is fine, it's higher in minerals?\n\n Remember the brain uses a lot of metallic minerals to relay light and conduct electricity That's how the brain and nervous function.\n\n  \r\nThe mineral concentrations in fish are far greater than any other food, especially in oysters and clams and shellfish, so those are your preferable.\n\n\r\nEggs are very important to cognitive function, not because of the mineral concentration, but because the available very tiny, easily digestible proteins from the egg white.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Complete Diet Schedule \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, so you understand why we eat in patterns, how the body works in patterns\n\n So, if you stay on the schedule, you'll have a lot better results with your body, mentally and everything.\n\n \r\nSo, when you wake in the morning, you've got an over acidic blood, that causes problems, lots of problems: you don't digest properly, you don't balance your neurological system properly, your brain won't function properly.\n\n \r\nI always suggest cuz everybody's so toxic, we're living in a toxic environment, you have a piece of cheese sitting by your bedside.\n\n When you wake, you have that little piece of cheese, whether it's a sugar cube sized or two sugar cube sized amount.\n\n If you're a big guy like him, whole tablespoon.\n\n \r\nSo, you have that, 10 minutes later you have your vegetable juice to alkanalize the bloodstream.\n\n not to really make it alkaline.\n\n Your blood on this diet should be about 5.\n\n5, on the acidic side, your urine should be 5.\n\n5, your saliva should be 5.\n\n5.\n\n \r\nAll of this lala stuff from these new aged healers are not looking at the body as if they were carnivores.\n\n  They're looking at us if we were cows or goats or horses, we are not an alkanalized animal.\n\n Everything should be acidic, but the blood goes to a 4.\n\n5, usually in the morning.\n\n \r\nSo, you need the vegetable juice to get digestion going and the blood more alkanalized to where it's at a 5.\n\n5 or a 5.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you need honey with the cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo not eat honey with the cheese?\n\n If you want to absorb poison, eat honey with the cheese.\n\n I suggest you only eat honey and cheese together twice in a day after the meat meal, but don't ask anymore questions because I'm gonna cover all of this stuff.\n\n So, no questions until I finish.\n\n \r\nSo, you have the cheese to absorb the toxins, no honey with it.\n\n Then you have the juice, depending upon the size you are and the amount of fluid that you may need and the particular juices that you may need.\n\n \r\nNowadays I'm using a lot of cucumber puree in there, instead of so much celery.\n\n\r\nCucumber puree provides lots of collagen precursors, so the skin is better, everything is healthier.\n\n You can see how much better my skin is all over, and I don't exercise.\n\n Especially in here, I started developing those old people's collagen there where they're not replacing collagen, and after doing this for just four months, it's all renewed.\n\n Of course I've been on a raw diet since 72, I react a lot quicker than most people.\n\n \r\nSo, after you have the juice, you wait about 20, 30 minutes, have another little sugar cube size or more amount of cheese, absorb more toxins that dump from the stomach.\n\n Remember most of the poisons that don't leave through the skin, dump into the stomach lining, and then they dump as you eat, a little at a time.\n\n So, it poisons your food.\n\n You're going to reabsorb some of that, and some of it's going to cause your food to pass right through you.\n\n What a waste of food, gonna waste something, let the cheese do it.\n\n It only takes a little amount of cheese to bind and attract and chelate and remove a lot of toxicity from the system.\n\n\r\nSo, after you have another cheese, if you have digestive problems, digestion's really slow, you eat an egg or 2, 10 minutes after the cheese, that'll get everything moving through quickly.\n\n Remember there's hardly any digestion to eggs and it moves everything quickly.\n\n When you get a lot of protein and fats into the body, it builds up the energy level quickly.\n\n You get stronger quickly, you'll have more energy quickly like coffee does to you, without the buzz.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that just the egg yolk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n Always the whole egg.\n\n That bullshit about the egg white and egg yolk, forget all of that.\n\n Forget all of that.\n\n It's all wrong, it's all hypothesis.\n\n I eat 50 eggs a day, do I look like I have a fucking biotin deficiency.\n\n No, I don't have a biotin deficiency and I've got stomach problems from the surgery?\n\n If anybody's gonna have a biotin problem, if you're eating the egg and the white together, I'm going to have it, I don't.\n\n I don't know anybody on my diet that eats a lot of eggs has any biotin deficiency.\n\n  So, Mercola and all those theorists, that happens in a test tube, does not happen in the human body.\n\n So, it's all bullshit.\n\n\r\nJust remember, if you don't have the protein with the fat, you're not gonna digest the fat.\n\n If you don't have the fat with the protein, you're not gonna digest the protein.\n\n, they've got to be together.\n\n \r\nWhen I did the experiments, and I said it in my books, when I did experiments on the experiments on animal feeding them egg white and egg yolk separately, they were ravenous.\n\n They ate twice as much food.\n\n They had huge imbalances emotionally and everything, so separating the egg white and egg yolk will cause tremendous hunger, imbalances, overeating, obeseness, water retention, all kinds of problems.\n\n And you're worried about vitamin B, biotin, absolute bullshit.\n\n \r\nOkay, you got it.\n\n I don't have to mention that again?\n\n It's in my book?\n\n If you need more going, then have another egg 10 minutes later, or 2.\n\n \r\nIf you're digesting properly and everything's fine, you go from the juice, 10 minutes later to a meat meal.\n\n If you have to go through the eggs, you go from the eggs to the meat meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n10 minutes after the cheese to have egg or go have juice, then cheese 10 minutes later, then meat 10 minutes later?\n\n \r\nSo, you have that meat meal at that point, because if you have a high carbohydrate meal, you're going to feed the nervous system a lot of carbohydrate glycogen.\n\n Carbohydrate glycogen is full of advanced glycation end products once that glycogen has been used by the nervous system.\n\n Columbia University found that the healthy body stores at a rate of 70%, that makes the lymphatic, the blood and the neurological system very sticky.\n\n \r\nSynapse don't fire right, ganglions get bunched up with their transmissions, axions do too.\n\n So, it causes a depletion of clarity of mind and consciousness.\n\n If you eat a protein meal, the body makes the glycogen from pyruvate with the help of glucagon.\n\n \r\nWhen you're using pyruvate to form glycogen, you only have a 7% to 8% amount of advanced glycation end products.\n\n We can handle 12% a day at a time.\n\n So, we never build up with this stickiness, so the mind stays clear, \r\nDon't eat anything with high carbohydrate for the first 6 - 7 hours that you're awake because for the first 6 - 7 hours you're awake, whatever you eat, your body will build the glycogen from those foods.\n\n\r\nSo, you save your fruit meal or high carbohydrate meals for the afternoon, somewhere between 1:30 and 3:30.\n\n If you're a night person, it's the same way.\n\n You just make sure that it's first 6 - 7 hours you don't eat a high carbohydrate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs milk high in carbohydrates.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Milk is high in carbohydrates, so only a little bit of that.\n\n\r\nWhen you have a milkshake, you've got egg in it.\n\n You've got lots of things to counterbalance the high sugar in the milk.\n\n Now you can sip milk a little at a time all morning, but you don't want to have a lot of it at one time consistently.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs a smoothie a high carb meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow the smoothie is high carb because you have fruit in a smoothie?\n\n\r\nSmoothie is a milkshake with fruit.\n\n Do not eat a smoothie in the morning, unless I specifically give you a little fruit for your particular condition.\n\n If somebody's got multiple sclerosis, I'll give them in their milkshake about 1' - 1.\n\n5' banana with some coconut cream in there, that helps get rid of the scar tissue.\n\n And I need to start that early, but that little bit of banana is not going to be a problem.\n\n\r\nSo, then with the meat meal, you always eat butter with that meat meal, so you don't turn that pyruvate into a fuel to give you energy.\n\n That's just burning up that expensive meat.\n\n You want to reserve that for helping create hormones to divide cells, to reproduce cells to heal.\n\n So, always eat butter or some fat with the meat.\n\n\r\nButter will always stabilize the meat better, but if you want to eat avocado or an oil with it once in a while, that's fine, but always eat some butter with it, at least a tablespoon.\n\n Two tablespoons for this guy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOlive oil and flax oil okay to eat with meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou could have 2 tablespoons, most people should only have 1 tablespoon per meat meal if they're going to have oil with it, if you want to have one good, delicious olive oil sauce with one of your meat meals, then you skip the oil for the next 3 or 4 days?\n\n Don't have it for those days.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat if there's a lot of fat in the meat.\n\n Is that good enough or would you still have to have the butter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you have a lot of fat in the meat, that will be fine, but most places you can't get good fat these days, they trim it off and throw it away?\n\n Boy, do I pig out when I go to Asia cause they have the fat hanging right there, so I'll just buy ropes of it and eat it.\n\n\r\nCuz I don't get cream there.\n\n I get some milk, but I don't get cream there.\n\n I take my butter with.\n\n So, I eat lots of this fat in place of the cream.\n\n So yes, the meat fat will be fine if you have enough meat fat, it should be a lot.\n\n \r\nIf you have your moisturizing/lubrication formula as your butter with it, you will be able to put more muscle and more strength into your body.\n\n So,  moisturizing/lubrication formula is better than just having plain butter.\n\n Cause the moisturizing/lubrication formula digests much quicker than just plain butter.\n\n \r\nWhen I have people who bodybuild, like people know Lucky, we have a lot of potlucks at his place.\n\n  When he came to me at 56 years old, he was on to diet 2 years and he had been real skinny and I mean, he was skinny.\n\n If anybody knows what James Stewart looked like before.\n\n Very skinny.\n\n He 6' 3'' and he was 140 pounds, that skinny.\n\n \r\nLucky was the same way.\n\n So, after 2 years on the diet, he put on about 35, 40 pounds.\n\n It's a pretty good weight, not what I wanted him to put on.\n\n And he came to me and he said, \"I've been skinny all my life.\n\n I want to be a bodybuilder.\n\n Can I bodybuild\".\n\n I said, \"Well, Lucky you're only 60?\n\n You're not dead\".\n\n He's 6' 1''.\n\n So, I said, \"Have two pounds of meat a day, one pound at a time with a whole lubrication formula with each meat meal\".\n\n And in 2.\n\n5 - 3 months, he put 4 inches on his arms, 6 inches on his chest.\n\n Golds gym ,they accused him of using steroids, and he says, \"No, I'm just eating eggs and butter and raw meat\".\n\n And they didn't believe him.\n\n\r\nBut you notice he stopped working out after a year, cuz he was working out so much and not eating properly.\n\n He didn't call me and say, \"I'm getting stiff\".\n\n I would've changed his diet, but he stopped working out, you see he's kept all of that muscle and he stopped working out.\n\n It doesn't deteriorate cause on this diet everything's stable if you eat the butter with the meat, it will last a long time.\n\n It won't dissolve easily.\n\n \r\nEat avocado with the meat, it's not going to last as long.\n\n Eat oils with your meat, the protein, the cells are not gonna last as long.\n\n They will weaken and your muscles will fall.\n\n \r\nSo, I haven't worked out on a workout schedule since 1979.\n\n Do I look like I have a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I don't look like you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhy not.\n\n\r\nBut you don't have that kind of system?\n\n You have a woman system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what happens to women with all this butter and moisturizing formula employment.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends upon the woman?\n\n Let save those questions til I get through the diet.\n\n Write those questions down.\n\n \r\nSo, you have the lubrication/moisturizing formula with your meat, you'll be much more stable.\n\n Your muscle, your glands, everything, your cells will be more stable.\n\n \r\nThen about 30 minutes after your meat meal is when you have your cheese with your honey, you've already got good digestion going: your proteins are partially digested, your fats are partially digested and if you throw a supplemental concentration of minerals from your cheese, easily digestible because the honey becomes the enzymes that are missing in the cheese, which prevents it from digesting.\n\n \r\nSo, when the honey's with the cheese, it provides the enzymes to digest those minerals, so it's your mineral supplement, your mineral concentration.\n\n So, you can rebuild your bones, rebalance your nervous system.\n\n All kinds of problems can repair with that mineral supplement, cheese with the honey.\n\n \r\nThen for the next 2 - 3 hours, sip on milk or the sport formula, stay away from water.\n\n It's just solvent, it just dissolves and leaches all kinds of nutrients out of your body, salts the same way.\n\n \r\nSo, then I have a milkshake and there's milkshake recipes in the book, so I won't mention milkshake.\n\n It's just egg, milk, a little bit of cream, maybe some coconut cream and honey.\n\n Some people, if they wanna speed the digestion up a little bit, they can take a little bit of ginger root, put a little grated ginger root in that and blend it.\n\n \r\nIf you have a hormonal problem and you want to get a little stimulated sexually, you could grate just a little bit of nutmeg in it.\n\n\r\nIf you've got toxicity and everybody does, always have at least a sugar cube size amount of cheese before everything that I told you to eat at a time.\n\n So, cheese before your juice, cheese before your eggs or your meat or both, and that's when you're adding eggs at a particular time.\n\n\r\nYou're having eggs in between meals, you don't need the cheese with it, but it's always helpful about 10 minutes before.\n\n And then cheese before your milkshake, cheese before your next juice, cheese before your fruit meal, cheese before your vegetable juice again, cheese before your meat meal, cheese before a cup or half a cup of milk at a time, always cheese 10 minutes before those things to absorb the poisons, so the poisons do not get into your food.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nHow about midnight.\n\n Middle of the night meal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe're gonna get to that?\n\n\r\nSo, after that second vegetable juice, you have cheese, the vegetable juice 10 minutes after that, let 1 hour - 1.\n\n5 hour pass.\n\n You can suck on a little milk or the sport formula, if you like or not.\n\n \r\nThen have a fruit meal, the fruit meal should always have fat with it, so the sugars don't rush into the body and cause a lot of stickiness in the digestive tract and a lot of problems all over the system,.\n\n The highs and lows of energy, we'll avoid all of that.\n\n\r\nSince coconut cream is your best solvent to dissolve toxicity and your fruit meal is your main detoxification meal, you mainly have coconut cream with a little bit of animal fat, always have animal fat with your coconut cream at that fruit meat.\n\n Because you're gonna have toxins that need to be arrested that the coconut cream can't bind with, so have a little bit of butter, a tiny bit of butter and a small amount of dairy cream, and that will protect your nervous system, your liver, and other areas of your body from excessive sugars.\n\n \r\nIt's always best to eat low sugar foods, unless you're having cramping or a lot of fatigue in your muscles, then you could have watermelon, but I don't suggest you have the very heart of the watermelon, cut a inch core out of that and throw it away, and then you could have a lot of watermelon, but have it with cream and a little bit of coconut cream to get the stiffness and the fatigue out of the muscles.\n\n You're building up with lactic acid and to other byproducts of metabolism, that's what causes stiffness.\n\n \r\nYou could use the vinegar in your vegetable juices, one or two of them to also relieve that, so you don't have to go for the fruit cuz some people get depressed when they have fruit, cuz they have a sugar high and a sugar low.\n\n Why get depressed.\n\n Who wants depression?\n\n Who likes depression?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nPsychiatrists?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\n*Laughs* Cause they make money from it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's only about 10% of the depression that goes on is eating too much fruit, high sugar fruit.\n\n \r\n90% of depression comes from a low E coli count.\n\n E coli is the final stage of digestion.\n\n It digests and releases 90% of the B vitamins that are in your food.\n\n E coli eats it, it's shit is our nutrients.\n\n That's how it works.\n\n Parasites, the bacteria, eat these foods and digest them for us.\n\n Their waste is our nutrients, that's how it works.\n\n So, if you have a low E coli bacterial population colonies in the bowel, you're going to have a tendency towards depression.\n\n That's a whole nother subject.\n\n I can get into that next time.\n\n \r\nSo, after you have your fruit meal, you let 2 - 3 hours pass.\n\n Then you can sip on milk, your sport formula, have another piece of cheese and then 10 minutes later, next vegetable juice, if you're having another vegetable meal.\n\n \r\nIf not, wait an hour, hour and a half, have your second and last meat meal.\n\n If you have diabetes, you should break your meat meals into 3, instead of 2.\n\n So, after your second vegetable juice, you'll have a meat meal and then have your fruit meat.\n\n You just lower the amount of meat that you eat at a time and you shrink the time between eating a little bit by half an hour, all the way throughout the day.\n\n\r\nAfter that vegetable juice, you wait an hour, an hour and a half, like I said, you have that cheese again, then the meat meal, your butter or moisturizing lubrication formula with that meat meal, 30 minutes later, you have the cheese with the honey again.\n\n\r\n Then through the evening, if you feel like you're fat or you're not digesting quickly enough, egg every 30 to 60 minutes, egg by itself.\n\n Do you not whip an egg, you just drink it down like Rocky or you poke a hole in one end to suck it out like I do.\n\n That way you don't have to clean a glass every time you're sucking an egg.\n\n \r\nThen before you go to bed, you need to relax the nervous system, make sure you sleep properly, so a half to a whole cup of milk, little extra cream in it with a little honey, warm milk is better for relaxing and sleeping.\n\n \r\nPut the same amount at your bedside, so when you awaken during the night, you drink it.\n\n You do not wanna go 5 hours without eating.\n\n You can make a milkshake and have half of it before you to sleep, and half of it during the night if you like.\n\n \r\nIf you're a hyperactive person, don't wake up after 5 hours and drink and eat, you won't go back to sleep, set your alarm for 3 hours, wake then eat.\n\n You'll go back to sleep, very few people have energy after three hours sleep.\n\n I have it, that's fine cause I only sleep about 3 - 3.\n\n5 hours a night, sometimes 4 and 5, but most of the time 3.\n\n5 - 4.\n\n\r\nSo, I never sleep.\n\n I'm always eating, always eating.\n\n Now you see me sucking on this here and there.\n\n I'm always eating and it regulates the body better.\n\n In another 14 years when I've done my 40 years to get my body completely healthy, I might be like the Samburu, Masaai, Aborigines' and the Eskimos where I can go a day without eating, and if I'm eating my own cells, I won't get toxic.\n\n\r\nBut right now, everybody that eats their own red blood cells are causing anemia and mass toxicity.\n\n There you have it.\n\n What time is it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n10 past 5?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe did it.\n\n Okay folks.\n\n We'll have one more on the 24th of August.\n\n I will be having my potluck in my place in Malibu.\n\n I usually have it in September, but I've got so much touring to do in September that I have to do at the end of August.\n\n\r\nI'm going to five different places.\n\n You're gonna get emails, so you'll know.\n\n Okay folks.\n\n Thanks for coming.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Cut&pain On Foot \n \n**[2008],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI also feel it in my bone, the pain and also the side of my foot, it's like cut in the side and blisters right here and it's painful to step on it\n\n And my mother with her callous, I wanna know, coconut oil is the answer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I don't see your mother's legs, but I see yours?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe toes curl like this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou wanna listen to me.\n\n For you you need vinegar?\n\n You're caking up, you're clotted.\n\n You're clotted in your veins, all in your legs, all over the body.\n\n You need some vinegar.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI better call you tomorrow cause I don't understand what you mean.\n\n\r\nFor the curled toes, just coconut oil for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Usually when you have curled toes that means you're not getting enough protein, the tendons are buckling up.\n\n So, she needs to eat meat, eat raw meat.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, she needs to eat raw meat.\n\n But I mean, for the pain?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor the pain, pain formula?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nPut it on her toes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, drink the pain formula?\n\n For that kind of pain, you could put coconut cream and vinegar on the feet to help dissolve some the crystal.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCoconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, coconut cream?\n\n Just remember, oil smothers the skin.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCoconut cream and how much vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI said two tablespoons of coconut cream, one teaspoon of vinegar?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Detoxing At Night \n \n**[2008],[Scott]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the last couple of weeks, just every time when I go to sleep, all of a sudden I start  detoxing throughout my body, through my skin, and it keeps me up\n\n My feet, you just scratch something and then it'll move to another foot and it'll go all up and down the feet, arms, back.\n\n\r\nNothing I could really locate for one thing.\n\n Or sometimes it feels like bumps, like hives are coming up and then it's gone and I'll get to sleep.\n\n And there's to be none, except tearing yourself apart scratching yourself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat he asked was, he's got a condition where during the night he itches a lot, things come out the skin.\n\n Remember, your skin is the main detoxification center for the whole body.\n\n If you were on an ideal diet, you wouldn't be putting out waste products.\n\n Everything that you have that you eliminate from the body, you could always recycle.\n\n\r\nIt is supposed to be that nontoxic.\n\n You could eat your own waste and recover more of the nutrients.\n\n In India because there are heavy vegetarians there, they drink their own urine to recycle their proteins.\n\n Your astronauts, what do you think they drink.\n\n They drink their urine, goes through a filter and they drink their urine?\n\n\r\nThat's how they get their water and fluids and nutrient, extra nutrients.\n\n So, when you're on a healthy diet and you've been raised on a healthy diet, you will have very little waste and any toxic waste that will come out, comes out the skin: not the bowels and not the urine, not the kidneys, not the bladder, not the urethra, comes out the skin.\n\n\r\nSo, everybody's gonna do their major amount of detoxification through the skin.\n\n A lot of health practitioners call the skin the major bowel.\n\n Because the bowel, I don't want you to think that the bowel is a detoxification area specified by the body.\n\n It isn't, it is no more of a detoxifier than your tear ducts or your ear wax or your mucus membranes.\n\n\r\nIt is not supposed to be a dump zone of toxicity, your skin is that area.\n\n So, when you have a major amount of it itching, usually it's a fungus that's coming out through the skin.\n\n Now a lot of times because of the vegetable oils that we've consumed, especially the hydrogenated vegetable oils that are the same molecular structure of plastic, fungus, molds break those down and they will crystallize, cause heavy dryness when coming through the skin.\n\n \r\nBest thing to do is put coconut cream on your skin.\n\n If you're blistering along with it, you put lime juice and then coconut cream with a tiny bit of honey in the ratio of honey to coconut cream is about 20 - 1.\n\n 20 coconut cream to 1 honey.\n\n Very small amount of honey, a drop per tablespoon.\n\n\r\nHe said when he wakes in the morning, it's all over.\n\n The nervous system mainly detoxifies at night.\n\n As soon as the sun goes down, it's full on by midnight and it's over by 5:00AM.\n\n So, if you can't sleep at night, you're going through a heavy detox.\n\n Don't try, you'll just be frustrated.\n\n Get up and do something constructive.\n\n If you're itching, put some lime juice or just coconut cream and honey on, and then do something.\n\n Read, do some work, do something, even do something creative.\n\n Write poetry, whatever it is.\n\n If you've got people in the house, put ear plugs in so you can sing, anything.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Dry Lips \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI keep my lips together and my teeth together and I draw it through\n\n I just wish I had a good, healthy nipple.\n\n I wouldn't have to do it that way.\n\n My mother went dry at two weeks old.\n\n I was two weeks old, so I didn't get to suck much.\n\n I wanna suck now.\n\n**[Scott]**\n\r\nSo, sip juice as well.\n\n You don't gulp juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't gulp juice either?\n\n Everything assimilates much better: I drink less, I piss less, I don't get as dry mouth.\n\n I used to have put cream like coconut cream or butter or primal facial body care cream on my lips all day long.\n\n Since I started sucking, I rarely put it on my lips anymore.\n\n\r\nSo, marvelous with the change, just in that little bitty technique.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Fasting \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, how come when I did the juice fasting in January for a week in England I felt really good afterwards and all the stiffness and aching went away for the first time in years\n\n Like, I felt so much better,  I could do more exercise, but then about four weeks later, I seemed to go into a massive detox?\n\n And since then, I haven't felt well at all.\n\n I've felt really ill ever since.\n\n So, why the initial feeling.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen you fast, like juice feast isn't really a fast?\n\n People will juice feast, there's a tiny bit of protein, but not much in juice.\n\n You can get about 2% of the protein out of it, so it's not much.\n\n\r\nSo, it's not starvation like with water, which completely leaches everything, causes lots of problems.\n\n Cuz water is solvent, it's not a nutrient, it dissolves rock plants eat.\n\n We're not supposed to drink water, it leeches and tears the body apart.\n\n \r\nBut if you drink juices, go on a juice feast for let's 5 five to 10 days, you will start cleaning things out of the body, but your body's going to eat itself to take care of that.\n\n And guess what.\n\n It's not gonna eat the toxic shit?\n\n\r\nIt's gonna eat the healthier cells.\n\n So, then when you stop that you're gonna feel good for 3, 4, 5, 7 weeks, and all of a sudden you're going to have all kinds of other problems because now you've got a concentration of toxic cells all over the body that you will have to detox that are loose because you've eaten around the good cells, cuz the body isn't going to eat the toxic cells to get the proteins because they're too toxic.\n\n\r\nSo, it'll throw you into a heavier detox following it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Frozen Sholder and Burstitis \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes, frozen shoulder or bursitis?\n\n Are they similar.\n\n Are they same?\n\n Do you have any?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA frozen shoulder and bursitis?\n\n A frozen shoulders when minerals build up and circulation is blocked.\n\n Vinegar with vegetable juice is very good for removing that.\n\n For someone your size, you could use 1.\n\n5 teaspoons twice daily, morning, and about 5:00PM.\n\n And the best way to take that vinegar is to take about drink about two to three ounces of your vegetable juice.\n\n Then mix your vinegar with just a small amount, like one to two ounces of the juice, drink that, and then drink the rest of the juice.\n\n\r\nIf you have bursitis, bursitis are little bitty sacks of fluid that are very concentrated, in hormones, like cortisone.\n\n The little bursas, they exist in all near almost all the major joints.\n\n When they get inflamed, they're extremely painful, excruciatingly painful.\n\n The best way to resolve bursitis is with the moisturizing/lubrication formula spaced throughout the day, drinking a couple tablespoons, every couple of hours with an egg just by itself even.\n\n Cheese or egg,\r\nBut the frozen shoulder is a mineral caking buildup, can be from lactic acid, uric acid mineral crystals, doesn't matter.\n\n You're just not cleaning out the joints.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould it be the same or is there a difference between, like if you can't lift your arm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you have a bursitis, you're gonna have an inflamed bursa, which is right here, and it will be in so much pain.\n\n They're different, completely different.\n\n One takes care of the buildup is vinegar.\n\n The bursa is moisturizing/lubrication formula.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Headaches \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI get headaches in the back of my head\n\n I haven't found any of your remedies to help much.\n\n I took the Fiorinal a long time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I've been experimenting with people who have the neck problems that have brain stem headache, and it's worked, I would say about 70% of the time.\n\n So, you can try it, it might work for you, but these were people that weren't relieved with my headache formulas.\n\n So, that's 70% more people that are helped.\n\n \r\nAnd what you do is mix coconut cream, like two tablespoons of coconut cream with a teaspoon of vinegar, mix that together, and you rub that into your neck twice daily.\n\n\r\nAnd it starts breaking down the congestion that you have in the neck, the crystallizations that don't allow the proper circulation cuz they'll harden, and then the blood will flow into the brain and the brain stem, but won't flow out.\n\n When you're doing that twice a day, even three times a day, it relieves that flow, so the blood will flow out of the brain as well as in, so that helps.\n\n\r\nYou have two tablespoons of coconut cream, one teaspoon of vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs coconut cream the same as coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, coconut cream, and coconut oil are two different things?\n\n Coconut oil only has your oil soluble fats, coconut cream has your water and fat soluble vitamins and enzymes and fats, big difference.\n\n \r\nIt has vitamin a, it has vitamin D, but vitamin a is mainly water soluble.\n\n You have oil soluble vitamin a, but most of your vitamin a is water soluble, like from carotene in carrot juice.\n\n So, there are a lot of vitamins, you have B vitamins that are fat and water soluble, and you'll have a lot more of all of them in the coconut cream, and coconut oil is very specific.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, they're not substitutes obviously.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNever?\n\n I can put on coconut oil and I'll turn black if I'm in the sun.\n\n If I use coconut cream because of the water soluble nutrients and, and vitamins in there, it will be a sun block, so I won't take in as much sun.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Healign Insinct Vs Eatign Schedule \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe question over here was that if you just follow your instincts and eat what you want to eat, how well is the healing\n\n I found it's about 30% to 50% only?\n\n If you address my particular structure of eating cycles Like schedule eating one and two on page 40 and 41 of the recipe book.\n\n\r\nIf you follow those, you will heal optimally and quickly.\n\n If you're just eating what you want when you want and not addressing the body's changes on the normal time schedule of the day, it's much harder on the body to do what you want to do taste wise.\n\n So if you follow the specific suggestions for the dietary plans that I have in the Recipe Book, you'll heal a lot quicker, about 50% or more quicker, and you'll stay more focused and clear of mind.\n\n\r\nAnd in the workshop I gave everybody that people have attended, I lay out why you eat what and at what particular time.\n\n If we have time, I'll go over that at the end.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) How To Get Cream, Butter Or Milk and Shippnig Butter \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFind somebody who will raise some cows or goats for you and take care of them\n\n \r\nShe lives on an island in the far east, so she's concerned that she can't get butter and cream or milk.\n\n\r\nYou could make a big run to Paris like every three months and store up on butter, that's what a lot of my clients in London do, and in England.\n\n They go over to Paris and get 30 pounds of butter for three months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOr sent from here.\n\n I live in London, I get mine sent.\n\n You can find someone willing to send it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt isn't more expensive to fly from here than Paris to London.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't know, but I get various things sent the same time?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nParis has very good cuz most of their butter and cream comes from the surrounding farms way outside of Paris.\n\n\r\nSome of those farmers that I dealt with when I was living in Paris, they traveled 250 miles to come to the farmer's markets in Paris.\n\n So, it was very good there, and also they now supply the health food stores throughout Paris, so you can get that there, but they will ship it from here.\n\n \r\nI've got farmers that will ship to Aruba.\n\n Antigua, London.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes the milk last.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, the milk won't last, it'll be curdled by the time you get that, aut at least the butter and cream?\n\n But like I said, if you can make a connection in Paris, it'd be cheaper for them to send it for Paris than it would the States and probably get there better.\n\n\r\nAruba, that's way down there next to Venezuela.\n\n I have a product list, and you can go on Jim's website and get it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) How To Regain Health After Detox \n \n**[2008],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, what do you do to regain energy, especially as you've just gotten off of a detox\n\n Is there any quick way to regain strength and vitality?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm going to repeat the question?\n\n He's just come off of the detox, the losing of the weight.\n\n The point of that is you gain weight, absorbs the toxins, and then you dump the toxins with the weight, the fat that's absorbed those toxins.\n\n So, he's just come off of a weight reduction.\n\n You've lost about what 25 pounds, 20 pounds.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nI would say I lost about 20?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe took off about 20 pounds, so he wants to know how he can get the energy back quicker.\n\n If you want quick energy, things that don't take a lot of time in digestion, eggs is the only thing.\n\n Eggs, they digest in about 27 minutes, 13 to 27 minutes.\n\n So, that protein, all that fat is readily available.\n\n\r\nIt only takes about three to five inches of the small intestine to absorb that.\n\n So, quick energy.\n\n If I'm getting a little sleepy or tired, I'll take just an egg and suck it down, and within 10, 15 minutes my mind is clear, gives a lot of energy.\n\n \r\nAnytime you come off of  a weight loss program you're going to have a little trouble digesting, cuz you're not used to digesting the complex foods.\n\n Especially meat, meat takes 19 to 22 hours to digest, even 24 hours to digest, so that's a little long.\n\n Milk relaxes the body, so that's not going to give you much energy.\n\n So, eating eggs, a lot of eggs will help propel it, but remember eating eggs alone causes massive weight loss.\n\n\r\nSo, you're gonna have to have maybe a tablespoon of lubrication formula with a little bit of cheese to give you minerals, 10 minutes later an egg, and you do that 45 minutes, you'll keep your energy level up and then have a big meat meal at night.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Lactic Acid, Uric Acid Crystals Muscle Cramps \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMuscle cramping says lactic acid build in the muscle\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLactic acid, uric acid, or mineral crystals.\n\n Could be three things: lactic acid, uric acid crystals, or mineral crystals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I had mentioned that I was having some of that sometimes, usually after eating.\n\n Is that correct.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can happen right after eating because your body robs the bloodstream of a lot of nutrients to go and start filtering through the digestive tract?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the remedy for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVinegar or whey?\n\n\r\nShe asked, she has muscle cramps after eating.\n\n Now, she's on a specific diet because she's recovering from multiple cancers.\n\n So, her body is a little bit more strained with toxicity.\n\n So, when she eats, her food will leave the regular blood flow from the muscles and the rest of the body to go into the digestive tract to help her digest.\n\n\r\nWhen that happens, a lot of the uric acid metabolism that we have just from moving about, you have waste products, which is lactic and uric acids and mineral crystals, and if they settle in the muscle, they can cause cramping.\n\n \r\nTo help relieve those, you can have raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar or whey and that'll help remove that.\n\n Sometimes watermelon can do it with the high potassium, pineapple can do it, but make sure you have enough fat with the fruits, so you don't get too sugared because when you eat a lot of fruits, it causes the blood, the lymphatic and the neurological system gets sticky with advanced glycation end products.\n\n Your mind won't function as well, you'll lose clarity, you'll lose thoughts.\n\n You'll lose train of thoughts.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Lose Weight In The Summer \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou need that fat to keep warm, you need to be stable\n\n So, you're gonna lose a lot of weight, you should do it in the summertime.\n\n Like I said, eggs are full of protein and fats, digest very rapidly.\n\n They can help you lose weight quickly, both water and fat weight.\n\n Don't take advantage of it though, don't get too thin.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Lots Of Eggs To Lose Weight \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow, the weight loss program in the book says little golf ball sizes of meat throughout the day to lose the weight slowly, gradually\n\n If you are very large, which nobody here is.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJohn Reis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJohn res is not very large.\n\n Nobody's too fat here.\n\n You can eat eggs to lose weight quickly lots of eggs without doing the meat, but you'll always reduce the size of your liver and everything and your pancreas if you don't eat the meat and you're just eating eggs.\n\n So, it's good to eat the small amounts of meat like I suggest in the weight loss program in the book,\r\nYou have just a little bit of cheese, like a sugar cube size amount of cheese with a tablespoon of moisturizing/lubrication formula.\n\n A lot of you know, or most of you know that for men, it's the lubrication formula, for women it's the moisturizing formula.\n\n It's the same thing.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you do that seven days a week.\n\n What you just said?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a good idea?\n\n And then once you build up, like do a heavy meat meal in the evening, like at least half of a pound, when you're getting back out of the weight loss program.\n\n Now some people, they don't have any trouble with an energy level once they go back to the regular diet, some people do have trouble.\n\n\r\nSo, it's up to you and what your system.\n\n Just remember this diet always fluctuates as per your particular physiology.\n\n You have to adjust it according to what's happening in your body, and you do that by looking at the symptoms, you look in the We Want To Live book and see what symptoms you have and you do the things that I suggest in there.\n\n\r\nSo, you alter your diet accordingly, the different fruits that you have according to symptoms will change.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Lympatic Baths \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLymphatic baths are taking an hour to an hour and a half bath at 101° to 103° to melt down the lymph\n\n You got a lymph glands and lymph nodes, most of your lymph glands are here, all around in here, here and here.\n\n These are your main lymph gland networks.\n\n You have lymph glands all over in small amounts, everywhere else.\n\n \r\nAnd a lot of little bitty lymph nodes all over.\n\n The body uses those to clean waste products out of the body.\n\n When we've been on a lot of margarine and vegetable oils in our lifetime, that hardens in the lymphatic system.\n\n So, that hour to an hour and a half baht will melt just a little layer at a time.\n\n So, it's like having a cold stick of butter in a glass and little by little, it melts as the heat works in.\n\n That's the way it does in the lymphatic system.\n\n \r\nYou'd have the pineapple, the coconut cream, the little bit of butter, the little bit of dairy cream with that pineapple, and coconut cream mixture right before you get into the bath.\n\n**[This was changed to have the mixture earlier in the day a few hours before the bath],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have that every day if you do 30 minutes baths every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n No, it's only for the long baths.\n\n\r\nYou're jumping the gun, let me get to those answers.\n\n \r\nSo, when that melts at that high temperature, like an herbivore, an animal that eats vegetable oils has a body temperature, 101° - °.\n\n It will keep vegetable oils thin and fluid.\n\n \r\nIn the human body at 98.\n\n6° and lower, vegetable oils harden and crystallize.\n\n When it gets jammed in the lymphatic system, like hard wax and crystals, it will not dissolve, unless we raise the body temperature, 101° - 103° degrees for an hour to an hour and a half.\n\n \r\nAny hotter than that, you're gonna waste.\n\n Now in the first print of my book there was a typo, it said 110° instead of 101°.\n\n So, people were cooking.\n\n So, it was years before I noticed that, like seven years before somebody said something.\n\n And every time I read it, I read 101°instead of 110°.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you got to get a thermometer and actually measure the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's good?\n\n I use a mouth thermometer, stick that in water and test it.\n\n\r\nSo, when you get out of the bath, after an hour to an hour and a half, it will be just a thin layer, melted and flowing.\n\n So, you get up and take a walk, you bundle up, stay hot.\n\n If it's hot like this, you still bundle like it's snowing outdoors and you take a slow, easy 45 minute walk.\n\n \r\nSo, what that does is that rushes the pineapple coconut cream mixture into that lymphatic system, so that when you cool down it will already have dissolved and prevented from thickening again.\n\n So, layer by layer through many years takes care of it.\n\n \r\nBut just to give you an example of how it works, I had a patient who was 68 years old, who was dying of prostate cancer and complete failure of the thyroid.\n\n Put him on the diet, he was on the diet for about two years.\n\n Functioning normally, but still in retirement.\n\n I finally talked him into taking the hot baths.\n\n So, he built a hot tub in his backyard in Bangkok, and he started taking the bath every day instead of two times a week.\n\n But because he was retired, he could sleep a lot and deal with that toxicity.\n\n\r\nIf you need to function, you don't want to do it every day, you do it every three to four days only.\n\n So, in three months of doing it every day, he completely became a new man.\n\n Everything was flowing properly, he started an international company and now he is working 14, 16 hours a day and 72 years old.\n\n 73 now.\n\n \r\nSo, big difference.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that formula in your book.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe formulas in the book?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the name of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLymphatic congestion formula, under lymphatic baths?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nIt's a good time to dry off after the bath before you walk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you get out of the bath?\n\n You keep the room hot wherever you are.\n\n You pad yourself dry, take about 10 minutes, cuz you're gonna be dripping and then put on long underwear and then heavy clothes on top of that, so you perspire into the long underwear.\n\n \r\n[To my knowledge, these walks were deemed not necessary.\n\n They are important, but many people couldn't do them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if you don't take a walk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're just going to go back to where you were before?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's not gonna actually get that layer out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust gonna thin it and then that's it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, like the guy in Bangkok, you could do it every day if you wanted to.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you have time to rest and recuperate?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou just have more detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, he did a lot more detoxifying?\n\n After his walk he did nothing, but sleep for four hours and it was up eating for several hours and then back to sleep again.\n\n\r\nWaking, eating, going to sleep, waking, eating, going to sleep for three months that way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow about riding bikes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine, but you don't wanna do something vigorous?\n\n You've already been in a hot bath.\n\n You don't want these exhaust yourself.\n\n It's supposed to be a mild slow walk, just to keep the circulation pushing, not speeding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about Tai Chi.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can do Tai Chi?\n\n Yeah, it's fine.\n\n As long as it's a constant movement, it'd be fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, if the person's used to like a higher level of exercise.\n\n How about a bath shorter than 45 minutes, 15 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's the amount of flow through?\n\n The lymph system is not the bloodstream.\n\n Rushing the bloodstream through isn't gonna make the lymph go faster.\n\n The lymph has its own slow movement no matter what you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, so slow cardio for a half an hour.\n\n\r\nThe nervous system will flow faster, the blood will flow faster, but the lymph system never flows fast unless you're really hot?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Lymph Baths On Weight Loss and Only Take If Overweight \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't suggest you do these lymphatic baths on the weight loss\n\n As long as you have the weight.\n\n You have enough weight, you can do it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut I'm on the weight loss.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's probably okay.\n\n With the amount of weight that you have, it's probably fine.\n\n\r\nI don't suggest anybody do long, hot baths, unless you are at least 15 to 20 pounds overweight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen I was on cooked food, before I ever found this diet, I would be able to sit in a hot tub forever and be fine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut you dried out like crazy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know, well I didn't know, but now I can't even do that.\n\n I don't have all that cooked fat in my body here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't have enough weight.\n\n You're not fat enough anymore.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou don't see me in the winter.\n\n I don't want it in the summer.\n\n I want be in a bathing suit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine.\n\n Summer's the time to be thinner.\n\n Well, I'm on a thin side, I'm only a 35 waist.\n\n I got two more inches to go get up to 37.\n\n When I'm in Asia and I go without a lot of milk, I go down to 30 inch waist.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Milk Gulping \n \n**[2008],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, you've said a few times don't gulp your milk, sip it\n\n Why.\n\n Because I love gulping milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHis question is he likes to gulp his milk and I say don't gulp milk, and he wants to know why, because he likes to gulp his milk.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAnd I sip it thinking Aajonus says, but every time I go, why though.\n\n So, now I get to ask you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat happens when you gulp any fluid.\n\n The H2O rushes from the nutrients and goes to the kidneys?\n\n You throw it off, you don't get to absorb it.\n\n When you suckle like a baby, you get lots of extra enzymes in the mouth.\n\n Those go into the milk, it's easily.\n\n digestible, even in the juices.\n\n They will be absorbed and distributed evenly and nicely, when you gulp, rushes to the kidney, you lose a lot of nutrients that way.\n\n \r\nI stopped gulping no matter what, I just don't gulp anymore.\n\n I cut my food down probably $60 a week just by doing that.\n\n Because I gain more weight now and I don't have to drink as much milk or eat as much.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nLike sometimes I'm really, really thirsty.\n\n Like I'm an outside in the sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you take one of those baby bottles with you and you suck on it all day like a sports person.\n\n You see tennis players out, they'll be sucking on it all day.\n\n Don't go hours without drinking, sip all the time.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWell, if you come back, as long as you sip it, like take a sip, let it go through slowly, then you can follow it by another sip.\n\n It's not the quantity, it's just the fact that it goes down slowly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt goes down slowly, is able to it enough time to assimilate.\n\n So, that takes time.\n\n Let's say you take a sip every minute.\n\n You can handle that.\n\n But  most people just go too long.\n\n\r\nSo, it's good to sip every 10,15 minutes.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nBut a sip every 15 seconds, wouldn't be okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt wouldn't assimilate as well?\n\n It's gonna rush to the kidneys.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou want a minute in between sips.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Oil On Face Before Sleep \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you put oil on your face thickly and go to sleep at night, you're not gonna sleep well cuz your skin has to breathe\n\n If you put honey on your face completely, you're gonna block it from breathing.\n\n You're not going to sleep well.\n\n That is how you find out about how blocking oil and the complete layer of honey can be to the skin does not allow it to breathe.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust one thing.\n\n Is it also good for the callous.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSame thing, callous you put straight vinegar on?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, for the clogged veins on the legs, would do it topically, not internally/\r\n\n\r\nYou do it topically and internally.\n\n You have the vinegar with your vegetable juice.\n\n If you get hard palpitations from that, you also have to mix an egg with that vinegar and vegetable juice.\n\n\r\nSo, you need the protein with it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Organic Pastures, Milk In Plastic \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[David]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I'm drinking a lot of curdled milk.\n\n I'm pretty much exclusively drinking milk that's curdled, that's yogurt and sometimes turns to cottage cheese.\n\n Cause I buy a lot of past expiration Organic Pastures.\n\n What kind of a substance, if I'm drinking so much yogurt to milk and even cottage milk that is sort of cottage cheese.\n\n\r\nAm I getting my daily cheese?\n\n Is the substance changing significantly from the actual milk?\n\n And also since it's Organic Pastures, is there anything wrong with Organic Pastures?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I don't like that Organic pastures put their stuff in plastic?\n\n That's what I don't like.\n\n**[David]**\n\r\nThat's the only problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a big problem?\n\n He denies it, but he doesn't give a shit.\n\n He's out to make money.\n\n He stopped using the bottles because he could make more money by using plastic and not having recycle it.\n\n**[David]**\n\r\nBut that plastic on the website, he asked stuff about he's pretty high in.\n\n Thinks it's really the best plastic there is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet me tell you, he gets that information from the plastic companies.\n\n The guys selling it.\n\n When I've done tests on milk that have come from not his milk, cuz it cost me about $2,000 for a test.\n\n Um, but when I did tests on raw milk that came in plastic, there was always some plastic residues in there.\n\n**[David]**\n\r\nBut are there better plastics and worse plastics.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOf course?\n\n**[David]**\n\r\nWell, the stuff Amos is using is still the cheap stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI get my stuff in glass.\n\n I buy his glass.\n\n I pay a lot of money for it, but I get it in glass.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, you mean it's not good to transfer it from the plastic to the glass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you wanna get it outta plastic as soon as possible?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, we don't buy the plastic if you get the two quarts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI prefer not having any plastic residues in my milk?\n\n I haven't done any tests because it's such a small amount, that even a small amount could become accumulative, but it's so hard to test for those trace amounts in the feces to determine, yes, it came from the milk.\n\n\r\nSomebody would have to be on a pure milk diet from plastic for me to be able to determine how much is passed out.\n\n But then other foods that would be hard to evaluate on how much plastic does damage.\n\n But back to your first question, which is milk in its different forms, always have different functions.\n\n\r\nNow, if I I've been on this raw diet so long, I am so clean.\n\n**[Goes on to say he doesn't drink much clabbered milk because it bloats him and he doesn't have toxic fats to break down]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Repeat Eat Butter With Meat \n \n \n \n \n### (25) Repeat Hdyartion Formula Recipe \n \n \n \n \n### (26) Sinus Problems, How Long To Heal and Mucus \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWith sinus health\n\n How long does it take to clear it up or does it get worse before gets better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends upon the individual and whether you've had a lot of medication?\n\n People who've had inhalers and cortisone, something like that.\n\n They take them seven or eight years, if you're young enough, like you are.\n\n Otherwise, it could take 12, 20 years if you're an older person.\n\n If you're an old geyser like me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI haven't had much medication.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou haven't had much medication, usually two years, two and a half years.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat was the question that he asked.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe asked if you've had a history of sinus problems, how long on the diet does it take to relieve that?\n\n That doesn't mean after two and a half years you're not gonna go through occasional detoxification, because the brain dumps its major toxicity out the sinuses, the nose and the salivary glands, the gums and the tongue?\n\n So, you're constantly going to be dumped.\n\n So, you're going to have constant irritation to the sinuses, but it's not going to be necessarily from a pure mucus factor.\n\n \r\nMost people have allergies because they don't produce the proper kind of mucus to seal off the toxins from getting in and irritating the mucus membranes.\n\n See the mucus is layers.\n\n It's like material, they'll be woven, the fibers are all woven into a mesh.\n\n The better the protein and fat level, the higher the protein concentration, the tighter the mesh gets.\n\n Layer upon layer as your mucus gets thick enough, no particles can penetrate and irritate the mucus membranes.\n\n So, there will be no allergies, as long as it's thick.\n\n \r\nIf something very toxic like mercury, aluminum or formaldehyde from vaccine is going to the brain, and you're dumping that out the sinuses, it is going to irritate the sinuses as it passes through.\n\n The more mucus you have there to absorb it and to grab it the less you will have irritation to the mucus membranes, but you are going to have some, and sometimes it's gonna be nasty, even cause nosebleeds.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes milk cause mucus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's a lot of fiction about milk causing a lot of mucus?\n\n Raw milk does not cause a lot of mucus.\n\n If you want to build a lot of mucus, you have to make milkshakes, egg and milk together with some extra cream will make good mucus, a lot of mucus and having a lot of mucus is important for the whole body.\n\n\r\nThose people who saw me drink this a minute ago.\n\n You saw I didn't hold it up and pour it, I sucked.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Skin Issues \n \n**[2008],[Scott]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis happened periodically, right\n\n So, it's just something that I'm just gonna have to ride with or is there something?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to ride?\n\n You see these white scars that I have and all these bumps.\n\n A year and a half ago, I went through a major one and I have all this little white scarring?\n\n\r\nI mean, they were coming out and huge and some of them even came out with large insects.\n\n Morgellons disease.\n\n A lot of people were getting nuts from a lot of the chemtrails and I used to sleep outdoors.\n\n I stopped sleeping outdoors because I noticed that when I stopped sleeping outdoors at night, I stopped having that much skin detox and stopped having that kind of bacterial detoxification.\n\n\r\nCuz I was sleeping under it at night, now I sleep inside because our government is insane.\n\n**[Scott]**\n\r\nYes, I am sleeping outside.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you're going to continue collecting it as I did.\n\n You're gonna detox indefinitely since your skin.\n\n As long as they're dropping the chemtrails.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you had insects coming out your skin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, with

WHITENING TEETH \n \n \n \n \n### (40) Skipped Whole Eggs \n \n \n \n \n### (41) Speider Veins From Dead Cells \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAll right\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat can help reduce the appearance of veins and capillaries on the legs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShe asked about the appearance of veins and capillaries, varicose veins, thrombosis, all of those are involved and that's when you don't have a lot of live cells in those veins, your body's starting to collect dead cells in the veins?\n\n\r\nAnd you may have blockages in your connective tissue.\n\n So, the capillaries will come very close, go right into the very top layers of skin, which is not normal.\n\n And the veins will get to where the capillaries are to allow more blood circulation in there, not normal, but that's what happens when you start clogging the veinous tissue and the arterial tissue with dead cells.\n\n \r\nFirst of all, you have to clear the plaque that usually occurs on the vein and arterial walls.\n\n Vinegar is the only thing that does it quickly, a good raw diet with lots of raw fats will take it away gradually when it's eating like coconut cream and pineapple is a good cleanser of those veins.\n\n\r\nBut if you're afraid of a heart attack or a brain aneurysm, you know people who have had strokes, the vinegar is the only way you're gonna do it quickly.\n\n Once you have a lot of vinegar though, you're gonna demineralize the body.\n\n So, you have to eat tons of cheese to make up for that loss, for that imbalance of minerals.\n\n\r\nAnd remember raw unsalted cheese eaten without honey goes to the body, pulls out the toxicity and moves out the bowels, you cannot digest it.\n\n I've done probably about 20 some tests, and I found that unless somebody eats honey directly with the cheese, you do not absorb the minerals, but when you do eat honey directly with the cheese, it's your best mineral supplement.\n\n\r\nAll of those minerals are from dairy and they are absorbed very readily and very quickly when you have a little bit of honey with the cheese, and it's a very little amount of honey in ratio to the cheese.\n\n So, it's 3 - 1 cheese to honey.\n\n It can even be less, it can be 6 - 1.\n\n So, it's one tablespoon of cheese to one teaspoon of honey or less, can be one tablespoon of cheese, a half a teaspoon of honey.\n\n \r\nIt's better to air on the lower side of honey.\n\n If you eat too much honey with the cheese, it's going to become a fuel for energy, rather than for rebuilding the bones and the rest of the body, stabilizing the nervous system.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Sperm For Wrinkles, Bone Marrow and Royal Jelly \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, it depends\n\n The papaya was to get rid of scar tissue and wrinkles.\n\n \r\nWhat works the best I found is sperm works the best to get rid of wrinkles.\n\n For some reason it works very quickly, it thins the skin.\n\n \r\nBone marrow will do the same thing, but not as quickly.\n\n If you've got the fresh bone never refrigerated, it would probably work just like sperm does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'd take away wrinkles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, have fun with your boyfriend.\n\n\r\nMoisturizing formula works too, cuz it has the Royal jelly in it.\n\n And that's another, Royal jelly also has stem cells, but it's frozen when it comes from China, almost all Royal jelly comes from China.\n\n So, it's all frozen.\n\n Do not refreeze it, that damages the stem cells, keep it in the refrigerator.\n\n A lot of people will tell you to freeze it, once it's thawed, it will damage it.\n\n It won't work again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat James gets from Rawsome was frozen too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's all frozen, he gets that from China?\n\n John gets it from China, sells it to him.\n\n So, it's already been frozen.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou said the moisturizing formula has Royal jelly in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDid you mean the skin formula.\n\n I didn't know?\n\n it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPrimal Facial Body Care Cream.\n\n That's what I meant to say, the Primal Facial Body Care Cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're not doing saliva and honey on the skin anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat works too, but sperm works the quickest?\n\n Royal jelly kind of stings the skin a little bit and can cause too much detoxification, too much abrasion, so you have to be very careful how you use royal jelly.\n\n Don't use it straight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you mix it with bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can mix it with bone marrow?\n\n You can mix it with some Primal Facial Body Care Cream, more concentrations that I called for in the recipe.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Types Of Meat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes, I do?\n\n I noticed you changed your emphasis on various things, before you used to be big on red meat and then red meat with butter was your big thing.\n\n Now you seem to change.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends upon the person.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, now you're saying any meat is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny meat is okay depending upon what is right for your body.\n\n\r\nIf you're anemic, you're gonna need more red meat.\n\n However, if you're anemic and have a lot of activity rings in the eye, which means you produce a lot of hormones for physical activity.\n\n You should not eat much red meat because the red meat's going to give you more adrenaline, more testosterone, more estrogen for physical energy.\n\n\r\nIf you do that and you don't exercise enough, you're going to be in anxiety.\n\n Anxiety is not exercising enough for the amount of hormones that you have in your body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n You used to be big on lemon juice with the green juice now it's vinegar.\n\n Are these just sort of updates.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no?\n\n That was just particular people that I gave the lemon juice with.\n\n\r\nIf people had a lot of blockages and damage to their intestines and liver, I suggested lemon juice with their juice, but that was only those people.\n\n Sometimes if they had impacted intestines and very dark intestines from the irises.\n\n I had them have pineapple with her vegetable juice.\n\n\r\nSo, it depended upon the person.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Will Body Detox On Its Own \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot that I don't want to do like everything that you prescribe, but is it true that the body is smart enough to just when you start raising the levels of the raw fats and everything that it will start detoxing on its own just how it's supposed to naturally, or do we always have to stimulate it by eating certain things in certain orders and all of that\n\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShe asked a rather complex questions, gonna take a little bit of a complex answer?\n\n She asked when you go on the diet and you're eating the fats, will you automatically detox without having to do the particulars that I address in the book for detoxing certain areas of the body.\n\n \r\nYes, your body will always address what it feels is most important, depending upon the fat that you're eating.\n\n If you eat butter and cream, you're gonna do less detoxification and more building.\n\n If you're eating a pressed oil, avocado, you're going to detoxify more.\n\n\r\nIf you have a particular problem and you're suffering from it, it may not be the worst problem you have in your body.\n\n So, your body may ignore that and go to something that it is more important.\n\n If you wanna get rid of the symptom though, you're going to have to address that area with a specific food that I have mentioned in the remedy section of We Want To Live\r\nNow, the cream stabilizes the nervous system.\n\n It's the only fat that will immediately address the nervous system, it helps calm it.\n\n Butter helps every part of your body, but not specifically the nervous system.\n\n There are several varieties of cholesterols, about 28 of them that address the nervous system and 90% of those 28, so about 26 can only be addressed through cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSay that last sentence again, please.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are 26 cholesterols that could only be made in its wholesome structure from raw cream and having a little butter with it helps increase the ability to soothe and protect the brain.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

It helps the skin properly, it'll feed the skin, helps perspire more.\n\n Clay has a little bit of oils and it will work to an extent, just depends on what kind of clay your using.\n\n French green clay is okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, in a situation like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPut some coconut in it?\n\n Coconut mixed with the clay.\n\n About how much.\n\n Coconut?\n\n Coconut cream?\n\n I'd say four tablespoons for a bath.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Coconut Milk \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the coconut, talking about coconut milk, right\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut milk, yeah,\r\n\n\r\nOkay?\n\n The coconut milk in my experiments have been a little funny.\n\n You get the Thailand or the Chinese coconut that tastes very funny.\n\n There's some kind of a chemical in it and it causes cramping in the tissues in some positions, it has a high alkaloid reaction, so those are not good.\n\n\r\nIf you get Mexican, Costa Rican, any of the South American or any of the islands that stay away from the Thailand coconuts with Chinese coconuts, they're putting something in the fields.\n\n They're doing something where it's not making it very good, it's causing a pancreatic problem.\n\n Diabetic type reactions to some people.\n\n\r\nSo, don't advise that one.\n\n But otherwise you could drink the coconut milk and it's fine.\n\n\r\nThe water is the milk.\n\n The cream is the what we juice from the meat.\n\n**[When he says coconut milk I think he means coconut water]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Heated Honey \n \n \n \n \n### (4) Hepatitis Is Last Ditch Effort To Save Liver, Raw Meat Helps, Dont Be Skinny \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd hepatitis is always the very last ditch savior for the liver\n\n Any of the hepatitis, whether it's viral or bacterial, that goes in there to break up the extreme toxicity in the liver.\n\n And if you have hepatitis and your eating properly lots of red raw meat, you'll reverse that liver condition faster than any other way.\n\n\r\nSo, the hepatitis is almost like a parasite, it will work that quickly.\n\n Consume or dissolve that much toxic liver tissue.\n\n So, it's a good thing to have hepatitis, bodyis trying to save the liver.\n\n That means you've got very toxic, very young.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI wonder if I passed any of that onto him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, he's got a weak condition.\n\n Anytime anybody has a bad liver, the liver breaks down fats, to digest fats and if you don't have the good liver, you're going to be weaker.\n\n The body will absorb the poisons, poisons will go intercellular, instead of inter-lipid, instead of entering the fat, it will enter the cell, damage the RNA and DNA, and all the other structures within the cell.\n\n\r\nAnd that what poisons the body.\n\n That's why I say don't be skinny, skinny people are the ones who have the worst condition later on.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you have an unhealthy liver and you are, say, in the ocean, and a sewage spill comes along or something, could you contract hepatitis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) La Hot Springs \n \n**[2003],[Suzanne]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe only one I have access to circumstances is the Beverly Hot Springs in Los Angeles\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you know, the well, they get it right out of the ground in LA and that LA River goes through there pretty polluted, and it has radioactive material and it's everything, so it's not the best.\n\n \r\nI stopped going there when I started getting your reactions in the 70s, it's best to go out to Glen Ivy.\n\n Marietta Hot Spring, but they haven't been open for a while.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Mercury Injections Detox \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor peritonitis they gave me 12 shots in this arm, about 2/3 of them were penicillin, so there's lots of thimerosal, so it's stored in my bursas and this joint, and that was part of my blood and bone cancer, this was the worst arm\n\n Well, then at the end of April of this last year, it started detoxifying, this was the day before I had to drive up to Nevada City to do a lecture and workshop and see patients for five days, and then I had to go directly from there to San Francisco to do the same thing.\n\n By the time I hit Sacramento, I was in so much pain that I had to buy a sling, keep my arm in, and I could only stand or sit without excruciating pain with my arm in the sling.\n\n\r\nSo, that night and every other night, I had sleep in a bathtub with milk and vinegar and the sea salt in it to make my body buoyant enough to where my arm would float without pain.\n\n \r\nSix weeks after that, a whole scab opened up.\n\n Now what happened was after five days, my hand turned black.\n\n It was a charcoal gray after getting out of the bathtub tub for about six hours, sleeping in it.\n\n\r\nSmelled just like mercury.\n\n So I knew it was the thimerosal from all the penicillin that I had got when I was 12.\n\n \r\nIn the bathtub I kept dreaming of being back there as that child at 12 years old being injected and all that pain that I had in my arm was identical.\n\n\r\nSix weeks after that, a whole scab appeared here, and then about six weeks after that, a tumor appeared.\n\n It got twice as big as it is now and then it took some fecal matter from a deer and put it on it, and it stopped it right away.\n\n Sorry.\n\n I did that because then the detoxification started doing the elbow and hand, so there's more pain, I should've just let it run its course.\n\n But the bacteria works very quickly though, is my point here.\n\n Put the fecal matter on this and it turned it into a wart and I only put it on twice.\n\n Bacteria will work that quickly with the tumor.\n\n Bacteria is very important for the body, so even the salt water can destroy the bacteria.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Oils, Coconut Cream \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a friend who's working with a young similar son\n\n He has brain surgery.\n\n\r\nHe's looking into the raw food diet.\n\n He was talking about raw oils.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you don't wanna use oil to regenerate brain tissue, it'll do just the opposite.\n\n Oils are 90% solvent reactive.\n\n That means they act like soaps, act like the dissolution compounds that dissolve toxicity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMaybe I'm sayin wrong.\n\n\r\nI'm asking you, I'm hearing this secondhand that there are raw oils that are like raw foods, but maybe they're not, like coconut oil is what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut is the closest to an animal fat, but it's still 40% - 60% solid reactive?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you really wanna go for raw butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRaw butter, raw cream?\n\n Raw creams a little bit more important.\n\n\r\nLots of raw eggs, lots of meat.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Pharmaceutical Industry Loves To Blame Bacteria \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nPeople don't get hepatitis from getting in the ocean\n\n Medical profession loves to blame anything natural, bacteria.\n\n Their theory is the bacteria theory, bacteria is responsible for all disease.\n\n \r\nBacteria is just the response of disease.\n\n Bacteria's there to help get rid of the toxicity.\n\n Just like vultures and crows eat decaying flesh.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, how about like surfers that contract hepatitis from surfing in a sewage spill area or something.\n\n Would you say that they already had a toxic liver.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey already had a toxic liver, yeah?\n\n You don't contract hepatitis from sewage.\n\n Like I say, doctors and medical profession love to blame that, but there's no scientific proof of that.\n\n\r\nThey've taken animals and put 'em in solutions like that, and they've never got hepatitis.\n\n So, the medical profession gets away with saying a lot of bs, nobody holds them to it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Poison Oak For Poison Ivy, Menstraution Depressed From Alkaloid Detox Causes Lack Of Bacteria = Eat High Meat \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nShe asked, what you use for poison ivy\n\n Poison oak, that's in the book.\n\n \r\nYou mean like PMS symptoms.\n\n  \r\nWell, most of the time when the body's getting ready to go into menstruation, you're gonna throw off a lot of hormones?\n\n And with that, there's a lot of red blood cell loss.\n\n So, the whole fat level gets very low, so does the bacterial level because along with those toxic hormones from neurological impulses, psychological trauma, when that's detoxifying, there's always alkaloids along with it.\n\n\r\nAnd the alkaloids are like an antibiotic and they will destroy bacteria.\n\n So, the bacterial level gets low, then the body has to do everything with solvents intact.\n\n It has to do everything on its own and if you were given a whole weeks work to do in two days, you wouldn't like it either.\n\n \r\nSo, the body gets depressed and you get it depressed along with it.\n\n The bacteria helps you break down these compounds, so then the body feels lighter.\n\n That's why when people eat the high meat, they get silly.\n\n 99% of everybody who eats the high meat gets high within about 10 - 20 minutes, they start giggling, and start feeling good because the body all of a sudden has a lot of help, has all those bacteria to deal with these, this degenerative matter that's in your body.\n\n\r\nSo, eat high meat, lots of high meat, and make sure you eat lots of moisturizing formulas during those periods, so you have enough bacteria and fats in the blood, and that'll mitigate those problems.\n\n You might even have two moisturizing formulas a day, one with each meat meal or make a large one and have half of it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Protein Allows Fat To Be Used Vice Versa, Fruit With Fruit = Detox \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe have one with the meat meal and another with meat meal\n\n That way you'll utilize the fats a lot better.\n\n Protein allows the fats to be utilized properly.\n\n Fats can't be utilized without protein, and protein cannot be utilized without fat, so that's why I want to put them together.\n\n That's why I advise having most of your fat at that meal.\n\n\r\nWhenever you have a fat with a fruit, it will be for detoxification, not for building or strengthening.\n\n Know that when you put fat, no matter what kind of fat it is, you put it with a fruit or a vegetable juice, and it will cause detoxification.\n\n\r\nAs far as trying to hydrate yourself, with all that fasting that takes years to rehydrate or relubricate every cell.\n\n You were at such an extreme point, it's not going be a awhile before you feel balanced.\n\n You just have to make it through.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about tomatoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTomatoes and a little cream would be little bit better?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm thinking the small cherry tomatoes, just pop them in.\n\n They're easier to eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can eat 'em all day long if you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust put it on or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can blend it together or drink a sip of cream, then eat some tomato?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Protein and Fruit For Energy \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you mix fruit with red meat, it usually turns it into a detoxifier or a fuel, instead of for regenerating cells\n\n Those people don't like too much meat, so if they eat it, then why waste it as fuel when you can regenerate cells when you can get it to make it younger and more vital and stronger.\n\n use your fat to burn as fuel.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Salad In Morning, Herbivores, Eggs \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike 7:00 AM and what I've generally been getting is salad, the romaine lettuce and tomatoes with lemon\n\n But then I have according to the book, nce I eat a Salad, I shouldn't eat for five hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it has to get far enough.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n First of all, I'd like to know a little bit more about that because I'm coming out of that meeting and the only time I'm gonna have to eat is then.\n\n So, I'm asking myself whether I should eat at a two or three hour point, and if I do choose to eat then,what kind of damage am I doing rather than if I wait to five hours.\n\n\r\nThat's the first part of my question.\n\n \r\nThe second part of the question.\n\n What kind of a salad can I start eating at these 7:00 AM breakfast meetings where I can not have to go to the five hour thing.\n\n I'm thinking like avocado, tomato, onion?\n\n How much farther can I go like, cucumber with no skin or is that getting the five hour.\n\n Green onions, regular onions?\n\n Can you gimme some insight on how I can create this salad.\n\n Just more information about the five hour thing and what I'm pushing and what I'm doing if I'm eating before the five period?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSee this leaf here on this stock.\n\n\r\nWe're not made to eat this stuff?\n\n It takes a vegetarian animal 48 hours to pass it through the system.\n\n They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule, but then you still look at cow and deer shit and it's still full of fiber.\n\n Not even they do it well.\n\n\r\nSo, what happens is it slows everything down and also over alkalinizes the intestines, and the intestines have to be acid in order to digest animal product.\n\n If they start mixing it and acid foods catch up with it, they neutralize each other and neither of them digest properly.\n\n That's why you want to make sure that if you have a salad, it's the last thing before you go to bed, so you wake up five hours later, down an egg or some milk that's not gonna catch up with it, and make sure your meat's eight hours later or something, so it won't catch up with it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, meat has to be eight hours after a salad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShould be eight hours?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAvocado and tomato, is that not a salad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's not a salad?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat else can I add to that to make it not a salad.\n\n Onion?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnion is a cellulose nd you can have small amounts of it, even with meat?\n\n But it's still fiber.\n\n If it's a little bit, it's okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI can have as many tomatoes and avocados.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there anything else I can add to that at all.\n\n A little bit of cilantro or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot much?\n\n \r\nAnd if you do that, if you do have a salad, then just down a lot of eggs about three hours later.\n\n Eggs are going to absorb even a few minutes after they leave the duodenum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut no earlier than three or four hours after the salad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTwo and a half hours, four eggs?\n\n\r\nYou can eat eggs two and a half hours after eating a salad, you don't have to worry about it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI can eat as many eggs as I want to, but no meat for eight hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n How about milk and butter?\n\n Same thing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on how much you eat?\n\n\r\nButter and fat don't depend upon the intestines for digestion.\n\n Most of that's digested in the liver.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCould I have like my fruit and my butter meal, four, five hours after that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nif your animal meal was conducive to the fruit?\n\n\r\nIf you're having red meat, you don't want citrus with it, unless it's a little bit of pineapple.\n\n If it's fish or some kind of seafood or a foul, then you could have almost any kind of fruit with it as long as there's fat with it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Salt Headaches \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNever had any problems, but I have had migraines my whole life and recently they've gotten better\n\n The only time I haven't had 'em is when I was pregnant and nursing.\n\n But I was reading about what you said about hepatitis and pineapple and what you said about the migraines and not having to eat the dairy, and having honey every five minutes.\n\n I'm wondering if the migraines, if you think the hepatitis is connected to migraines.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot unless you're eating a lot of fats that can't be digested.\n\n That can cause high blood pressure from blood toxicity, which causes a headache.\n\n\r\nThat's a toxic headache, but it's mostly salt.\n\n Some people are very allergic to salt.\n\n They have a one grain of salt in a meal, that's enough to set off a migraine.\n\n I'm trying to tell my father that for years, and then when he went to the doctor and the doctor, he started having a heart arrhythmia, doctor said, \"Well, stop counting and stop eating salt\"/\r\nStopped eating salt and his migraines went away, waited until he was 67.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven with Celtic salt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven Celtic salt, any kind of salt?\n\n A salt is a sodium concentration and the sodium is not bioactive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about in swimming.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSodium doesn't absorb through the skin easily?\n\n Not unless bioactive with enzymes.\n\n There's not a lot of enzymes in sulfur.\n\n\r\nWell, it destroys bacteria and you need lots of bacteria when you have cancer.\n\n It isn't that you absorb the salt, but the salt will destroy the bacteria all the way to the connective tissue.\n\n \r\nNow, it won't get to the lymph system.\n\n The people who have skin cancer, melanoma, lymphatic cancer, they need that bacteria.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Stay On Raw Diet \n \n \n \n \n"

month.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean, you do have to lose your weight somehow with energy, that's a fact.\n\n You take in food, how do you use it then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI just eat lots of eggs?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou eat a three pound of meat a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I eat 1 - 3 pounds a day.\n\n I average two pounds a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how many eggs do you eat a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf I'm on a weight loss, only about 1/2 - 1 pound of meat a day and I'll eat up to 30 eggs a day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOn the weight loss.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot the weight up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, let me tell you?\n\n Eggs will take the weight off quickly.\n\n \r\nI made that diet to let people come down slowly.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nReally slowly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* then bring down the meat and eat more eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Heart Scan , Sugar Test, Physical Tests \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs your strength good\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Yeah?\n\n Tthree years ago I went through testing in St.\n\n Louis at Washington University Medical School.\n\n And there was a team of cardiologists which were examining raw fooders who had had to be least raw footers for five years and they wanted to take a look at me cause of the high fat diet, their cardiologist, thinking fat, this guy's gonna have plaque all over his heart, arteries, everything.\n\n And you figure, when I was 15.\n\n5, I started with the angina, which is an older person's disease, but they have plaqued arteries and heart and they have to constant heart attacks.\n\n\r\nAnd I probably had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15.\n\n5 til I was 22, and 50 of them caused me to pass out.\n\n So that was like 8 or 9 a year that it caused me to pass out, which isn't so many, but I never died and only a few times did I get taken to the hospital.\n\n But I was out of it by the time I got there and was examined out of the heart attack.\n\n\r\nSo, there was no need to revive me.\n\n And that's probably just cause people are older when it happens, it's harder for them to recover.\n\n So, here I was at this University of Washington's medical school, they have a sonogram, that's how they tell the plaque and usually it takes 'em about 10 minutes, 7 -10 minutes, and they're satisfied.\n\n\r\nThey stayed on me for almost 25 minutes.\n\n Looking, looking, looking, look, look, look looking.\n\n Couldn't find any.\n\n They just found some here and the choroidal artery, but that was heavily plaqued when I was 15 years old.\n\n So, there was hardly any, there was just a little bit in that artery, plaque.\n\n Will probably go away in the next 10 years.\n\n\r\nThey were so impressed cause I'd been a juvenile diabetic and they say juvenile diabetics never heal, so the pancreas is dead and that is it.\n\n They gave me a sugar glucose tolerance test, and it's the first time I had had sugar since 72 or 73.\n\n So man, I was just buzzing.\n\n I mean, I tried to write something and the blood pressure had my hand moving so much I couldn't keep standing and they'd take the blood every half hour and test it to see your sugar level.\n\n\r\nAnd usually around the fifth test, which is three hours later, 2.\n\n5 hours later, it's usually around 102 - 104, and then the stops.\n\n Mine went all the way down to 54.\n\n They said I had the strongest, healthiest pancreas that they've seen.\n\n \r\nRight after that kinda sugar because they measured the insulin too, so the insulin was high.\n\n See in diabetics, there's no insulin.\n\n So, the sugar level is high because there's no insulin.\n\n Mine dropped with insulin, ripped it out.\n\n Controlled the toxic sugar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat kind of sugar did they use.\n\n Cookie or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n They give it to you in a liquid, its a syrup.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you converted that into the whole box of Oreo cookies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'd probably be what's equivalent into a package and a half Oreo cookies?\n\n \r\nLet's say a box of sugar cubes that is about like this.\n\n\r\nProbably about 15 sugar cubes of sugar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's not a normal amount sugar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the way they test it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm surprised you would let them give you that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wanted to see, I wanted to know.\n\n I did not let them x-ray me though, they wanted to X-ray me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat did they want to x-ray.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMy chest, heart and all of that bones?\n\n \r\nHe was so impressed cause the head of the cardiology division of that university in that medical school is a famous world renowned sports cardiologist for the US Olympics team and athletes all over the world.\n\n So, he was really impressed.\n\n He says, \"Can we do some more tests on you\".\n\n And he says, \"You've only agreed to do these\"?\n\n And I said, \"Sure, do some more tests, what you wanna do\".\n\n And they said, \"Well, one thing you have to the gym and see how you perform\"?\n\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I haven't performed since 1970.\n\n Haven't done any exercise and lifted any weights, done anything like that since 1979, but let's go do it\".\n\n He said, \"Okay, we'll take it easy\".\n\n I don't know how much of a test it's gonna be if you take it easy, you know.\n\n \r\nSo, we went up to this top floor, and they had an indoor track and they had all of these electrode machines where you hook yourself up and through a radio wave that sends it back to the machine so they can register everything?\n\n Heart, the brain, the pulse, everything.\n\n So, they wired me up, they glued all the the electrodes to me and I had to sign another lease.\n\n \r\nFirst they put me on the leg press, see how much weight I put, they started me off of 40 pounds.\n\n I said, \"Why don't we start with 90\".\n\n \"No, no, no, no?\n\n We got to do this right.\n\n You know, I'm not gonna get sued because you get hurt\".\n\n Said, \"Okay, just wasting a lot of time\", he went up 20 pounds each time, so he got up to about 260 pounds with the legs and then I went *struggle* and he said, \"Okay, that's enough\", but it took 260 for me to start showing strain, I probably could have done about 320, something like that with heavy strain.\n\n \r\nSo, then it was the bench press.\n\n So, I got up to 190 before I was like this *struggle*.\n\n And he said, \"Okay, that's enough\".\n\n So as soon as I show a good sign of pushing hard, then he stopped the exercise.\n\n \r\nSo, I got up to 190 and then he put me on the track.\n\n So, I did five minutes on the track, but every time I did an exercise, my heart was regular within three minutes.\n\n It was on the high side of normal after a 90 seconds.\n\n He said, \"I've never seen anything like this before.\n\n I have people who workout, three, four days a week that can't do what you\", he says \"You're no youngster\".\n\n\r\nI was in my mid fifties when those tests were done.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Property \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThailand, also to satisfy me, 10% of the patient basis will be completely free and they will be the poor people at Thailand\n\n\r\nThere will be some kind of work exchange for some people, I'm gonna arrange for all types of ways to get people in.\n\n But your normal therapists and everything like that have to be Thai.\n\n It has to be so many in order to do it in Thailand, a great percentage of the workforce has to be Thai.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe way the system hits here in this country is so heartbreakingly, young people and they can't afford different things to heal themselves.\n\n They have through whatever the insurance will give them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n In Aruba, now that I have my PhD, my clients there are arranging there with the government, they've already set it up.\n\n When the health center gets open, they have their own health system there, and it's for everybody and it's free, it's like in Canada, so they will fly the people to the health centre in Costa Rica and pay for it completey.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTheir own people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, in Aruba?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf people going from America or from another country they have to pay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's going to change?\n\n It's just like Campbell Insurance Company, they ensure certain firms, certain workforces, they paid my bill even when I wasn't a PhD.\n\n\r\nThey paid, the cost of coming in to consult from the work.\n\n \r\nThat insurance company pays alternative therapy cause they know they work.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you belong to them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I don't?\n\n I have patients.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Algae and Plankto, Why Fish Have Mercury \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou have to understand that plankton and algae, they're plants, they eat rock\n\n So, whatever's in the rock, they eat it and make it something good and we could eat them and do fine cuz planktons a cross between a fish and a plant, so they can handle it.\n\n\r\nYou know, the theory is because plankton eat so much mercury that the animals who eat them, like the swordfish, is a highly toxic animal, but it isn't.\n\n Swordfish can move so fast because they know how to utilize the mercury favorably.\n\n \r\nIt isn't like the mercury they use in injections and it's like, science says, \"Well, we've made this radiation.\n\n The radiation that you get is just like the sun\".\n\n No way it's anywhere near like the sun, isn't produced the same way at all.\n\n And the arrogance to say that same quality as the sun is ludicrous.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Brewery Grains \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe eggs that I buy, I talk to the farmer on how he feeds the chickens, and he said part of the feed that he gives is scraps around the farm\n\n But a lot of the feed is what's left over after the breweries run water through grains to make beer.\n\n \r\nIs that bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not great?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt didn't sound too good to me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's not good at all.\n\n We get our eggs from Lily and they run around on 10 acres.\n\n She does feed them some meat byproducts, although she's not supposed to, she does.\n\n She has an area, two acres for the eggs we want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, do you get the same eggs in the stores here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, she feeds them wrong?\n\n They're the same except she doesn't feed them any raw meat scraps.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe don't have good source of eggs down here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou need somebody to run up to Los Angeles weekly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe get it once a month.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you could do it once a week.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Coconut Cream Detox, Lack Of Dairy \n \n**[2006],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen I was in Burma, I drank a bunch of coconut milk after I got outta-\r\n\n\r\nCoconut water\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCoconut milk?\n\n They would take the coconut and they would put it through a grinder.\n\n And you know, they would take all the meat and ground it and that's what they'd give me, and they would do like five or six coconuts, I'd end up with about a quart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCoconut cream, right.\n\n And I had sugar cane juice on the street, same thing.\n\n They just took a sugar cane through like a hand grinder.\n\n And I was eating raw eggs to offset the fact that I had eaten so many fried foods during the meditation retreat I was at.\n\n Mm-hmm.\n\n \r\nI lost about 20 pounds at this retreat, you couldn't eat past noon every day, but was that a good thing to do for my body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Clean out the stuff.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then what happened was I experienced an extreme amount of diarrhea for like two weeks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, you will with that much coconut cream.\n\n My God.\n\n Lucky you didn't go every hour.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n But so that was a good clean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n May have demineralized you to some extent, so eating cheese when you returned would've been the best thing to do.\n\n Lots of cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I started doing butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot after doing that regime and being mineral deficient, you won't digest the fat.\n\n \r\nIf you're going to eat the lubrication formula, you have to eat it with a lot of cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's safe to do that.\n\n You could drink a bunch of coconut cream?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends upon the individual, like I said, it could demineralize the system too fast?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if you ate cheese with it to keep the minerals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHave you made a coconut cream cheesecake.\n\n It's very nice?\n\n \r\nDepends how hungry you are.\n\n I've been so hungry I downed a pint, of course I had diarrhea for two days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think 3 oz (6 tbsp) is enough for me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, me too most of the time, but when I'm in Asia and I can't get dairy, I'll consume at least a cup of it a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it a good substitute for the dairy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot really?\n\n It's not building, it's cleansing, but it's a fat that I have to have.\n\n I eat so many more eggs, sometimes I eat up to 40 a day.\n\n\r\nI still eat meat there.\n\n I can get lots of meat.\n\n It's just that I'm so used to having so much dairy fat, cream and the butter, heaven.\n\n And it just stabilizes my body, really grounds me.\n\n And then when I'm there in Asia for seven weeks at a time, and by the fifth week, I start downing that coconut cream more often.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Coconut Cream Rips Up Metals \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCan you buy the jars full of the virgin coconut\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf ou take one of those jar lids that are metal and you put coconut cream on it, within about an hour it turns gray, starts ripping the metals up?\n\n You put that oil on it, it could take a week.\n\n\r\nSo, coconut cream that does it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt pulls out more toxicity is what you're saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMetal toxicity?\n\n Well, it pulls out anything.\n\n It can dissolve lymphatic plaque.\n\n It can dissolve in almost anything.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Coconut Machine \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n I bought to make coconut cream in Thailand arrives tomorrow at the lot\n\n So, I'm gonna train people how to use it cause they trained me in Thailand.\n\n So, these machines are great.\n\n It's like the Greenstar Gold that's about 4.\n\n5 feet long.\n\n It's stainless steel.\n\n\r\nIt's about this high off the ground.\n\n So, you could do 50 gallons an hour.\n\n 50 gallons an hour.\n\n They're so fast.\n\n I bought three machines, one to take the shell off the coconut.\n\n Those guys can do a de-shell a coconut in three seconds, three seconds.\n\n\r\nIt takes me about 20 seconds.\n\n I've only just learned how to use the machine, but 20 seconds is very quickly to get the whole shell off.\n\n Then there's a machine to take the broken pieces, then we break it, the coconut and put it in the machine that grates it, and then we put the grated coconut through the juicer.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Coconut Oil 1 Tbsp A Day \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you recommend eating that for us\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne tablespoon a day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou do recommend it though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's oil?\n\n If you're having coconut cream, you don't need it.\n\n because you're gonna get oil already in the coconut cream.\n\n But it's all alternative to eating, let's say, olive oil.\n\n Definitely better alternative than flax oil.\n\n**[Feel free to listen to the rest, but I didn't feel it was worth transcribing]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Coconuts Are Often Bad \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike 2/3 are bad\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's only cuz you're getting ones that are already out.\n\n When you get fresh bags in, it's usually 8-9/10 good.\n\n \r\nIt's just that when they're in the stores, the Mexicans and all the people who know how to choose coconuts and use coconuts a lot, they get the first pick and they know the good ones, so you get left out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI heard they soaked them in mold retardent before they ship them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSome of them, yeah.\n\n If you see real white skin outside, yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes it matter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut if they're light brown, they're not?\n\n\r\nWell, it doesn't really get to the heart of the coconut.\n\n \r\nThey can be light brown and dark brown.\n\n No.\n\n If they still have hair on them.\n\n If the hair's off, they'll always turn dark brown.\n\n Medium to dark brown.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHave you seen the ones at Henrys, they're packaged fantastic and they're very, very dark and they're scored around.\n\n Have you seen those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey don't soak those in mold retardent?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou don't think it matters.\n\n You would still use them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, we've got a good source of coconuts?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you have a good source.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause James Stewart, who runs our co-op, that's what he did for 30 years, was buy and sell produce, so he knows every contact there is, organic produce?\n\n \r\nHe's one of the first ones started organic produce business way back in the early 70s.\n\n\r\nI tell him what I know about being in the fields, what's going on out there, between the two of us, we get the best stuff.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe'll be having coconut, he'll make it every week.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, every week?\n\n Make it every week.\n\n\r\nKeep it in glass.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you'll make it and we'll be able to buy it from you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I'm not gonna make it.\n\n I just bought the machinery and I'm gonna train them how to use it and make it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cooked Fat Swollen Tissue, Aajonsu Bdy Shrinking, Cooked Fooders Losing Height \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI've noticed since I've been on this diet my bags under my eyes have swelled up\n\n.\n\n.\n\n swelling on the diet.\n\n**[skip to 00:36 on audio],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nNo, it usually decreases over time for most people.\n\n However, if yours had been very thin and starting to cirrhos, which means harden, then more fluid would be brought into that area to try to keep it from hardening together.\n\n So, you'd have more circulation.\n\n So, it could be just temporary, could take six, seven years.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's pretty temporary when we figure it takes 40 years to clean the body completely.\n\n I'm only 34 years into the raw diet.\n\n But that was the eating meat for 34 eating years since 76.\n\n It was 30 years of eating raw meat and I didn't start eating it on a daily basis until 82.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, it's 26 years of eating meat on a daily basis, but in the last three years, my bones have gotten small, but more dense, no osteoporosis, nothing like that.\n\n It's a trunk.\n\n When you eat cooked fats, cooked foods, the fat molecule swell from 10x - 50x their normal size.\n\n  \r\n\r\nA good example I like to use is John Travolta.\n\n Remember how tall and lanky and thin he was when was 30 years old that.\n\n Well, you see him just slightly starting to get bigger by the time he's 30 and then after that to his 30s and 40s, tremendous swelling.\n\n I mean, this guy used to be tall and lanky and now he's huge and thick in his bones eating all that cooked food.\n\n It does that to a lot of men.\n\n \r\n\r\nTake a look at Russell Crowe.\n\n Same way, very slender.\n\n Remember he was that nude robot in one film and then you see him in the gladiator the other film and he's huge and you see all these actors going from very thin to really swollen bodies as they get older.\n\n Mine is doing the reverse because I'm not contaminating it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I've gone from, you know, my body fat I used to like to keep it minimum 27% body fat, and that's what most women have, not men.\n\n And most athletic men have body fat about 7%, and I used to keep 27% minimum for me, and that's what I like.\n\n Now, I don't need as much fat, so I'm about 22% body fat.\n\n Do I look like I'm 22% body fat.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI've got abs that are cut?\n\n It looks like I have 7% body fat in the people who eat cooked foods, but I have 22% body fat.\n\n Three weeks ago, I was 20% body fat.\n\n That was a little slimmer, but my waist is now 29\" - 30\" waist.\n\n When I had blown up from everything, it went up to 37\" - 38\" waist.\n\n My chest, it swelled up to 40\" - 41\".\n\n It's back down on the 36\".\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it's taken me 34 years to get to this point to be where I was when I was 16 years old.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHave you shortened in height.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot at all?\n\n Havn't shortened a bit.\n\n Exactly.\n\n 5' 7\" 3/4, exactly where it was at 16 years old.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's good.\n\n I was wondering when you said you both got smaller.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Not in height, but it's just width.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd all my brothers have shrunk.\n\n My dad went from 5' 6\" - 5' 4\", he is 5' 3\" something.\n\n And my youngest brother who was 6' is down to 5' 10\".\n\n He's three years younger than I am, so he'll be 56 this year or he's just 56 in January.\n\n He's three years younger than I and he's already dropped almost 2\" \r\n\r\nNo, no, no.\n\n You started wearing down the cartilage.\n\n My cartilage isn't wearing.\n\n Everywhere, vertebrates, everything.\n\n All the cartilage whittles and people just start droppings, whittles away.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (12) Dairy Importance \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI just wanna ask about dairy, there has been a number of people, I don't take a lot of names of the Yahoo site, but a lot are going off dairy on this site\n\n**[stopping drinking dairy],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n\r\nYou have to understand that from my talking to the people that run that site, they get a lot of people who are really vegetarians that feel that dairy is wrong, and they get on the internet and start telling people stories.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know, it's just stupid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd it's not nice.\n\n They have their agenda, which is to stop the people from eating dairy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you do believe that theory is really important in this diet for the minerasl, for the fat, for what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor everything?\n\n It stabilizes people.\n\n I mean, I've tried diet with just eggs and meat and the amount of stability is impossible to reach.\n\n The butter is so important for the whole system, stabilizing it and keeping it from getting disease.\n\n And then the cream is so for settling the nervous system and without the milk to supply yourself to so many minerals so quickly.\n\n\r\nCheese is a great absorber.\n\n I mean, such a wonderful tool.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, somebody else not here, but I had here, someone said to me that I was making all my milk mainly soured, letting it sit, that you lack some, I don't know what it was said at the time.\n\n You'd lack something if you turn all your milk into acidity with the sour, I should be drinking some non sour, is that correct.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's correct?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I should have what.\n\n Half of it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, not necessarily half, you just need some minerals that will not be absorbed as fully?\n\n So, I will take some fresh milk, I'll put it in a bowl of warm water, hot water, and I burned my hand in the hot water for about four seconds.\n\n I'll let it warm and then I'll do warm up and I'll let that sit for an hour in the warm water and stirs cool, but not cold.\n\n And then I'll do it again for another hour and then I'll drink that warm, I'll drink that milk warm.\n\n \r\nAnd I may drink a quart on one or two days a week.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do you drink it warm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCold milk shrinks the stomach, you don't secrete hydrochloric acid; casein and milk sugar will not digest properly, it gets into the blood when it enters the duodenum undigested?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy do you do it twice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause I like the bacteria to build up a little bit, but bacteria start doesn't start building up until it reaches a certain temperature?\n\n So, I wanted a couple of hours, at least with the bacteria building.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut we are already having our soured milk anyways.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I'm talking about fresh milk right out of the refrigerator.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Dentist \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, he's been around the field a long time and when I first introduced him to this, he went online, he and spent a month researching natural stuff\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor you.\n\n Are ou talking about the food or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHis dentistry?\n\n \r\nHe'll do anything I say, if I don't want x-rays, if I don't want Novacane.\n\n I had a tooth over here, it's missing and the cap fell off of it and I thought, I'd been on the diet for raw food for 24 years and I was eating a lot of dairy, cheese, and I thought I'd be able to remineralize that tooth and the cap came off it, it just rotted.\n\n It kept breaking off and everything and then there was just that stub in there and I said, \"I want to get it pulled, I just want you to go ahead and pull it\".\n\n And I said, \"What you need to do is you need to cut around the tooth\".\n\n So, he says, \"I have this tool which goes in and I slide it in and then turn it around and it cuts all the flesh around the tooth\", and I said, \"That's what I want\".\n\n So, he said, \"You want me to use the minimum of Novocane\".\n\n I said, \"I don't want you to use any Novacane, just get in there and do it\"?\n\n He shuttered, he went to his father, an older man, probably, probably 65, 66 years old, not much older than I am, and he shuttered too.\n\n\r\nHe said, \"No, you're not gonna do that, are you\".\n\n He said, \"Yeah\"?\n\n So he went in there, pushed in.\n\n I said, \"Now what I want you to do is I want you to push it in, gimme a few , seconds to mitigate that pain.\n\n Let that pain wave pass, and then twist, and then let that wave pass and then yank it out\".\n\n \r\nSo, he did exactly that and the thing we didn't know is that the nerve that went all the way up into here had become fibroid, so it was a whole balloon.\n\n So, when we pulled that out, it was harder getting that out than the tooth.\n\n So, it made this big pop sound and the blood went across the room, and he was expecting to go in there and find my mouth full of blood, but it just had that one squirt and my body clotted just like that, stopped it instantly.\n\n No bleeding beyond that spurt out.\n\n But I had this huge sack that had fibroided from that tooth and he was impressed.\n\n\r\nHe'll do anything that I want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOn a scale of 1-10, what was the pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've gone through so much pain, this is just another one?\n\n It was very brief because when he pushed it in, that was probably a good three seconds of tremendous pain, like you hit a nerve, but then it stopped.\n\n So, it took about 45 seconds to mellow out, to just drop numb.\n\n Then the next one, the same thing, just twist it around, that probably didn't take more than three to five seconds.\n\n It took me about another minute to let minute to let that wave and pain and everything subside and throbbing and blood pressure.\n\n \r\nYou could feel it pounding with every heartbeat and then the pulling of it, I think that was probably the most pain cause he had to pull that fibroid tissue through that socket.\n\n It was only so big.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Did Dairy Make Western Cultures Stronger, Mongolians Blood With Milk \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you think that had a lot to do with Western history developing with the consumption of dairy product in the west\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI think it developed mainly because, except in Africa, the dairy was produced in very cold climates where there wasn't a lot of food in the winter, lot of things went into hibernation, so dairy was always available and cows didn't freeze?\n\n You'd milk them twice a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou think that the dairy made the Western culture stronger in some ways.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, definitely?\n\n Absolutely.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's how Genghis Khan conquered the largest portion of the world.\n\n Mongolians were a meat, dairy society, no vegetable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey also bled their horses so they wouldn't have to carry food like the Maasai.\n\n They didn't do it to the cows, they did it to the bulls.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nNot enough to hurt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey'll bleed the bowls for five days.\n\n Blood milk, equal portion taste delicious.\n\n If you've ever had blood, it coagulates pretty quickly, gets thick and it tastes metallic a little bit and it's really fresh and liquid and drinking it right out of the bleeding animal.\n\n It's easy, it's okay, but once it sits in a glass for five minutes, it becomes unappealing to me.\n\n\r\nBut when you mix it right away with milk, it's like ice cream.\n\n It has no relationship to the taste that it has on its own.\n\n The Maasai are the tallest, strongest, healthiest, smartest tribe in the world, and they're the only ones that on a daily basis for three months a year, and they only drink the blood and the milk together during the times that the cows are lactating for the calves and they don't have enough milk for themselves, so they have to supplement it with the blood.\n\n And they're growing spurts on that three months, every day, several times a day, eating the blood and the milk together is giving this height, the average height there is 7 foot tall.\n\n\r\nThe tallest person is 9 foot something, smallest man is like 6\" 3\".\n\n That's a short guy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI heard they don't want to have anything to do with western culture.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they don't.\n\n After Shirley McClain and that whole group for like 28 years, kept bringing donuts and candies and garbage, and the children started getting sick and they saw harming their entire tribe.\n\n \r\nThey went to the government and said we don't want the white man within 20 miles of our villages anymore, don't want them influencing our children, our people, anything like that.\n\n We will agree to go out to hike 20 miles every day and do rituals and sell our art to the white man, but we don't want him within 20 miles of our villages and the government agreed.\n\n\r\nThat's the way it stands today.\n\n The only way you ever get to see a Maasai is if he's left the tribe and got in culture.\n\n Like the one Maasai who was a singer who was quite a famous singer, now he's on David Letterman a couple of months ago, extremely bright, bright young man and you can see how well their brain works, they're so calm.\n\n\r\nBut I had a feeling he left the tribe early and didn't eat entirely because he didn't have the height of the normal Maasai tribe.\n\n He was only about maybe 6' 1\".\n\n\r\nWell, the Pygmies all only ate heavily cooked foods and they didn't eat any dairy.\n\n Strictly meats and insects always heavily cooked and fried.\n\n Everything fried.\n\n They'd take a slab of lard from a wild pig and they would boil that first and then cook the meat in that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Diet Msotly Of Raw Fish, Fish Is Fatty \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDiet predominantly on raw fish\n\n Is that fairly beneficial or is that detrimental.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor the people who in tropical areas, I find it's pretty good?\n\n I can't do it, I've tried it.\n\n It's not enough nourishment for me.\n\n I start getting fatigued, I lose too much weight and I'm just hungry all the time and irritable.\n\n Start getting irritable once I get down to a certain weight, so I can't live on it.\n\n \r\nThere are natives who can, there're lots of Asians who can.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nEven if they don't have the fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFish are full of fat, high fat?\n\n Almost all fish, there is some that are leaner.\n\n\r\nWhenever I buy fish, I buy the fatty section.\n\n I mean really fatty like the tail end of the swordfish.\n\n That's my favorite.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, we don't have to worry about mercury in tuna or anything like that when it's raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe fat of the fish has already dealt with the toxicity, and bound it in fat?\n\n If you cook that fish, you fractionate that bond and that heavy metal does into your system.\n\n\r\nAnd when I did test with swordfish with 12 animals, well 13 counting me, almost 1415, it was broken up into half plus me, eating it raw and half of eating it cooked.\n\n And we took the urine and feces from each animal, had them separate,  so we could see that if there was a ratio high difference between the ones on raw and the ones on cooked, what they had to do with digestion or whatever.\n\n \r\nSo, we checked the urine and the feces, all that was collected in the day for three days after eating the swordfish.\n\n Nothing else was given except for water during that three day period and the lab technician had measured the amount of mercury in the swordfish and how much is in concentration, and then of course how much was given in to each animal and that much mercury.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[sorry it cuts out here]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Dry Sauna \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt burns your skin, so if you're gonna do a sauna, it means getting out every three minutes to rinse off, to make sure it doesn't burn into the skin\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRinse and wipe with the cloth or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr just get in there and rinse with a cloth while you're under the shower, but then you're not be cooling your body every three minutes?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, these saunas don't have a shower in them, just a room was a lot of dry heat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I mean.\n\n Some are still 168° at the end.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And she's been there for I think 20, 30 minutes or something.\n\n \r\nThat's not helping her to detox anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it is, but it's damaging her skin.\n\n She keeps destroying skin cells, she's gonna have very old skin.\n\n She may be cleaner inside, but she's not gonna be cleaner on the surface.\n\n Especially women, vanity.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, overall, she's not much better by doing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, she's better internally, the lymph glands, everything will be better, but her skin won't?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat will it look like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it will age and be dead, it will turn into elephants skin?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWet sauna at the end.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Cause then you've got the high steam burning the sinuses and that'll damage mucus production and the lungs too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nShe's better off in the bathtub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBathtub or a jacuzzi?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Eating Only Keir Compared To Fresh, How Much Water \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI love to take cream in hot water, little hot water and a lot of cream\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour going to demineralize your bones if you do that.\n\n\r\nCream already demineralizes, that's why I had people using cheese with the cream to bring it down to a certain level and you add water to it, you can really demineralize.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you add water to the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean, if you just put a dab of hot water.\n\n\r\nIt's just a little.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet me pour just a little bit of hot water down your throat and see what happens.\n\n You're only gonna burn the esophagus and part of the stomach in your mouth, but how are you going to eat after that.\n\n You're not gonna eat for a couple weeks and then you may die if you won't be able to eat, unless you're gonna intravenously feed you or put the whole tube in your stomach to feed you?\n\n\r\nSame thing happens in the cells, the orifice of the cell is burned solidly shut.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you think it's a good idea to keep your milk warmer when making kefir.\n\n Like if you want a certain type of bacteria?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you want to make it quicker.\n\n I just come back from a trip an dI had no warm fresh milk, cultured milk.\n\n I'll put it in a bowl with warmer water.\n\n I'll put honey in it first cause then they'll thicken quickly, within like 15, 24 hours, I have kefir, thick kefir, if I will heat the milk like that three, four times in a 24 hour period with honey it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI was wondering if there are different types of bacteria where different temperatures might be more beneficial.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere probably are, but they're always the same bacteria, just like between a human being and an eskimo?\n\n Or a human being and a tropical.\n\n\r\nThey're both humans, of course a human Alaskan's gonna tolerate the cold weather more than the tropics.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's the minimum amount of time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor me, it's two hours?\n\n If I put it in hot water, let that sit in that water for an hour and then I reheat the water again and leave it in there for an hour I can drink it.\n\n There's no problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe were talking about amount of sour milk and ordinary milk.\n\n If you had an idea of what would you say, how much of each.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would say with your system, and most people are very toxic, 2/3 sour & 1/3 fresh?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI've been doing 100% sour.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre you eating cheese.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen probably you're not going to have a problem, but still it's better to have a little bit more fresh.\n\n\r\nKefirs already predigested, it's broken down, so you're gonna get a lot more from it.\n\n But there are certain mineral bonds that don't occur in the sour that are in the milk.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, should I do a 50/50.\n\n or two?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'd say 1/3?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\n1/3 regular milk and 2/3 kefir.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\nWhen I did my experiments with eating nothing but kefir, I started getting tremendous gas and diarrhea.\n\n \r\nSo, you haven't taken it to that point.\n\n I can't do it.\n\n I have to eat 1/3 fresh milk, 2/3 kefir.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou probably do take quite a bit more milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n If I'm eating kefir it's 1 quart per day, if I'm drinking milk, it's two quarts.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI'm not drinking that much.\n\n I'm drinking three quarts a week.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I stay away from water.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, I don't drink much water either.\n\n You totally stay away from water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDuring the winter?\n\n probably had a cup of water all week.\n\n\r\nSip here and there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat kind.\n\n\r\nDoes it matter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you should always drink water in glass?\n\n So, it can be Avion if you want flat water, it can be sparkling water, as long as it's naturally sparkling like Gerolsteiner, San Pellegrino.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Egg Fat, Dry Mouth Use Honey, Honey and Butter For Mouth Erinkles \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI mean, I'm like an addict\n\n I'm terrible.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt does just the opposite.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut what does my body want then if it doesn't want that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt needs fat?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm just doing the eggs, 18 eggs a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n18 eggs, those fats burn.\n\n They don't solidify or stay in the body, they burn and remove toxicity.\n\n That's why I say if you eat eggs, people eat 50 eggs a day, they'll lose weight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat else do I need to add.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you need honey with almost everything you eat?\n\n The fat in honey, I found in my experiments, especially on the mouth, relieves dry mouth more than anything.\n\n\r\nYou can put butter in your mouth, put cream in your mouth, you can do all kinds of things, meat fat in your mouth, meat fat is the second best, and that will relieve the dry mouth sensation.\n\n But the dry mouth, like I've said before, when the brain detoxifies all those heavy metals, it does it through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands, most of it.\n\n Some of it through the sinuses.\n\n \r\nWhen it comes out, it creates all that plaque around the teeth.\n\n It also causes all the fats in the face because the everything coming down, all up in the nerves and the teeth and all down the gums, those channels outta the brain are ripping all the fats out and all of the skin and flesh.\n\n\r\nThat's why all tribes who don't eat a lot of fat shrivel at the mouth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, all the eggs are drying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDrawing?\n\n You're not adding any fat, it's gotta be butter, or it's gotta be cream, it has to be coconut cream, things like that.\n\n But if you want to replenish the mouth, the only fats that are absorbed wholly and completely into the cells around the mouth are the fats in the honey.\n\n\r\nSo, use saliva and honey.\n\n I don't know how well you remember I used to have heavy lines a year ago, all up in upper lip, and just in the last year, I've been extremely using the honey/butter, they're almost all gone.\n\n And I never get dry mouth and dry lips again, unless I go my workshop, long day, talk for eight hours and I don't put the honey and saliva on, then my lips will get dry again and start cracking it.\n\n \r\nIf I put that honey and saliva in there, I never get dry mouth and that I don't go for water anymore.\n\n \r\nDry mouth is due to brain detoxification.\n\n All the poisons leave the brain, pull fats out of everywhere it comes out.\n\n It's like a magnet, just takes all the fat up its way out.\n\n\r\nSo, it leaves this whole area dry that's why everybody wrinkles around the mouth heavily and around the eyes cause the tear ducts are constantly flowing it out and then that'll cause dryness around here.\n\n \r\nWell, you remember I had 12 layers of skin here in all those years of being on a bad diet and I started putting the honey and and saliva on the forehead about eight months ago and it's down to about four layers.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEvery night.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I just do it.\n\n I'm not that vein.\n\n I just do it when I feel like.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou do look different.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's very different.\n\n I just do it two times a week.\n\n\r\nHoney and saliva.\n\n Put the saliva on an area first so it's very moist and I put saliva on your finger again, just dip it into the honey put saliva on top of that.\n\n So, you're just putting a very fine layer so it's barely much.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Fried Fat, Stem Cells \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYour fat molecule is very sensitive, when you start frying it, you damage your ability to breed stem cells in the body\n\n \r\nWithout stem cells, you don't grow very well.\n\n If anything's deformed, it will remain deformed.\n\n Everybody knows what stem cells are.\n\n Stem cells are a fatty cell that can become any kind of a cell?\n\n It can become a brain, neuron, or it can become a liver or pancreas, or muscle tissue.\n\n It can become whatever it wants at the time it enters wherever it is.\n\n\r\nIt enters the heart, become a heart cell.\n\n The body needs arteries instead of a heart cell, it will build an arterial cell.\n\n\r\nSuch a small amount once you're over 21 years old, very small.\n\n \r\nThat's why a company one of my patients owns called Thera Vitae take the stem cells from the blood and culture only the stem cells, so you get concentration of them and they inject them in the heart.\n\n\r\nI've talked with the physicians there because, they're in the office, all of them and even consultants, all of them, the doctor, and they inject 30 - 40 injections in a heart during the procedure of injecting and the report that I got about a month ago from the physicians who were responsible for the heart patients before they came to Thera Vitae, said that their observation of their patients who had the stem cell injections that the effects after a year and a half were still working.\n\n It still showed progress in the unusual healing of the heart and surrounding area.\n\n\r\nOne doctor said that a persons pancreas that was  beyond borderline diabetic that it healed his pancreas.\n\n It went into his heart, but after a year it started affecting the other gland.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo they do it into the liver or anything else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey don't do it right now, they're talking about doing more this year, more organs in other parts of the body, they're gonna start that this year, I think in August or July?\n\n But right now, it's strictly heart.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you think that's quite a good thing to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a wonderful thing?\n\n\r\nIt's a persons own cells and bred their own blood.\n\n What we're thinking about doing is getting the people to come to the Primal Diet Health Center first for a few weeks to a month before they have this done, so that blood is really good and rich and healthy and then breeding it in that blood serum should even increase and then those 20% that it doesn't work for, this will probably increase their ability to be able to utilize the stem cells.\n\n \r\nStem cell can become any cell.\n\n\r\nThey're fat cells.\n\n We have fat cells all throughout the blood, white blood cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA stem cell is a fat cell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a type of fat cell?\n\n It's a type of white blood cell, but they are differentiated in that they can become any cell.\n\n\r\nWhite blood cells are called the defenders because fat can absorb toxins without being damaged.\n\n It's like fat people, that's why I say fat is so important to get fat if you want to get well quicker.\n\n Cause the fat can arrest the poisons without going into the cell and damage the RNA and DNA and your vitality.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes everybody have stem cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverybody?\n\n\r\nYou can find a greatest concentration in the bone marrow.\n\n So, just like we breed the red, white blood cells, self cellular division of the red, white blood cells happens in the bone marrow.\n\n \r\nExcept in the fetus, you know, they're all over the fetus.\n\n They seem to be breeding everywhere.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Glycerin \n \n \n \n \n### (21) Gulf Is Polluted, Aajonus Proeprty, Stem Company, Spas \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I said, well, you know, nobody's offering to buy me a- he said, \"How about Costa Rica\"\n\n I said, \"I checked Costa Rica, too expensive\"?\n\n You know the only real estate agency down there is century 21 from America, and they jack the prices up so bad, it's terrible.\n\n \r\nI won't live on the Atlantic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause that's the Gulf and two US nuclear bases dump their nuclear waste there in the Gulf?\n\n Plus you have the Panama Canal, which is very close, and it's all that oil from the tankers.\n\n And some of those tankers are backed up for three weeks to a month, and they're sitting out there spilling all kinds of garbage.\n\n\r\nI don't eat anything from the Gulf.\n\n I won't liver there.\n\n So, it's very expensive.\n\n He said, \"Well, how about I build it for you\".\n\n I said, \"Be my guest\"?\n\n So, he made a call right there to a friend of his in Costa Rica.\n\n Said, \"I need 100 acres.\n\n Get it as soon as you can\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould you have both.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I'd love to have both.\n\n Thailand and Costa Rica.\n\n That'd be perfect cause then all people that are close to Asia and Australia and Europeans would go to Thailand and then all the Americans and South Americans, north or south, could go to Costa Rica.\n\n \r\nThailand is central between China and Australia and I've got a lot of Australians.\n\n In fact, they want me to come in July to Australia is long in Asia.\n\n I'm gonna go to Australia and do a workshop.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich part.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBrisbane?\n\n It's a Gold Coast trail.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd that's where I got the butter and the culture cream butter.\n\n And that's the milk that you only buy, it's Cleopatra's Bath Milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* that's okay.\n\n Doesn't matter what for.\n\n \r\nHelp build a health center in both Thailand and Costa Rica.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow's the progress on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the partners are doing very well with their other company?\n\n They have the stem cell company where they take the stem cells from a person of blood, they have a laboratory in Israel, they take the blood and send it to Israel, to the laboratory, they separate  the stem cells from the blood.\n\n They breed it in your own blood serum when they separate it, so it's all natural and they put it with a courier to take it to Bangkok, it goes to the hospital, and then they inject it in the heart.\n\n \r\nThey got a three year license from the country of Thailand to do experiments on humans because they've been done only on animals and in all animals there was not one case of, of rejection, there was not one case of any side effects.\n\n After two years of doing the tests, the same was for the humans, not one reject cause it's your own stem cells bred in your own blood serum.\n\n\r\nIt completely reversed 80% of the heart disease.\n\n Where it was mitral valve prolapse or bypass, the body actually builds new arteries to bypass its own arteries in three to six months.\n\n So, it was so extraordinary and the test went so well that eight Nobel Prize winners joined the board of that company, plus the King's own cardiologist.\n\n\r\nSo, they gave him a license to go ahead and become commercial as of January, so it was a year early.\n\n But because of that, that put me on hold, my health center on hold, the money for the health center cuz now that they have the license already and they know they're gonna do it, they need 13 million to build the laboratory in Bangkok cause they can't keep trucking it back and forth from Israel to Bangkok by messenger.\n\n Too many things could happen cause you have 24 hours to get it into the person once it leaves the land.\n\n So, it's risking it too much and it's only $36,000 right now.\n\n And open heart surgery is anywhere from, you know, $125,000 - $300,000.\n\n\r\nAnd people are going from othe wheelchair to the tennis court three to six months, so it's pretty amazing.\n\n \r\nAnd Don Ho, anybody know who Don Ho is.\n\n ?\n\n He was famous in the sixties for that song and he's 72 years old who lives in Hawaii, had open heart surgery last year, and it didn't work.\n\n Plus he got a pacemaker, wasn't working.\n\n So, he went to Bangkok and had this done and seven weeks later he was doing full sets back to work.\n\n\r\nSo, that put them on the map.\n\n So, they're making money with it.\n\n And everybody told them, no you're gonna need $32 million - $50 million for this kind of a starter company, and it would take you five years before you would get any money.\n\n And they did it with $3 million for two years.\n\n\r\nSmart people, and they're on the diet.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI was listening to public radio and it looks like SA Institute and a bunch of others that could have a consortium, other company, and they're gonna start this big stem cell research thing in San Diego.\n\n They're all excited about it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're doing different stems cells aren't they.\n\n They're not doing blood stem cells are they?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI'm not sure?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the problem with the fetus stem cells is they were rejected something like 60% of the case just like having a transplant problem there.\n\n But when you have your own stem cells from your own blood and you're breeding your own blood stem cells, there's no rejections, no side effects.\n\n\r\nThey're very happy with that.\n\n\r\nWhat the health centers are going to do is they're gonna provide the Primal Diet food completely.\n\n We're gonna have 100 acres on each one.\n\n One in Thailand, one in Costa Rica.\n\n So, we'll be growing all our own food, herbs, everything year round because the areas I'm picking are tropical enough to grow all year round, all the food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIncluding the meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah?\n\n We'll have cattle, we'll have dairy, we'll have everything.\n\n The farm that my grandparents had was only 50 acres of growing and barns and we about 40 Jersey cow, which supplied all the milk from just about 10 miles west of Chicago all the way to Peoria.\n\n It supplied all the milk for all the towns round all through the early 1900s, late 1800s.\n\n And plus that was 40 acres of corn that we grew to feed the horses cause they Clydesdale horses to pull the wagons to deliver the milk.\n\n \r\nOf course in the 20s they had the delivery trucks, classical things to start delivering it.\n\n But my grandfather, he liked to stick with the horses and the buggy.\n\n He did it all the way up to the 30s with the horse buggy or he didn't get out there himself, helped do it, but it was all milked by hand.\n\n He never went to machine all the way up.\n\n It was about 49 when he stopped producing dairy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you grow up on raw milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was born in 47, they started boiling it?\n\n My grandparents bought the bull.\n\n It was all boiled.\n\n She would boil it right there on the stove.\n\n I don't think she did it with all the cream, she cuts on the cream off, so we're getting cream with our cereals, berries.\n\n She had a great raspberry garden.\n\n\r\nSo, at these primal centers, the diet will be 100% available every day, day and night.\n\n There will be lots of hydrotherapy, outdoor hot baths.\n\n The land that I've chosen, 60% of the land is bordered by Elk River, so we'll be able to use hydro and solar power, should be completely self-sustainable.\n\n\r\nThe river has a great deal of red clay, so we do like they do in Vietnam at one of the spas there, siphon the clay mud into these tubs where people can sit in a warm clay and stay in there for- in Vietnam at that particular spa, they only lets you stay in for 20 minutes.\n\n I would like people to stay in it for an hour - hour and a half, especially if they have lymphatic damage.\n\n\r\nAnd then there'll be swimming pools and there'll be kitchens where people get to learn how to make primal food, how prepare dishes, and lots of therapists, massage therapists.\n\n Anything that I know that has worked.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith Chlorine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n It will be an electrical chlorinator.\n\n So, you just put real sun dried sea salt in the water and the electric coordinator turns it into a non-toxic chlorine with no chloroform vapors.\n\n It's called an electrical coordinator, made for pools.\n\n \r\nAnd they're relatively inexpensive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, they do them in New Zealand everywhere.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n So, I've got friends in Nevada City who have it for their very natural looking swimming pool, I swim there every time.\n\n One time they put too much salt in, it was like swimming in the ocean.\n\n I didn't like that, but that was only once they did that.\n\n I think they went to pour it in and sack broke or something, got too much salt in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n Is there any place that you would go here locally to just swim.\n\n Any type of any kind of spa?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNothing, there really isn't?\n\n Well, the closest thing, it's not that far from here is Deep Creek.\n\n That's in Hesperia, just on the other side of the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\n You go 15 through San Bernardino and you get off at Hesperia and then you ask for- well, you might be able to find directions on the internet to the Bolin Ranch field, and it's about 25 miles east from Hesperia.\n\n\r\nAnd you go to the Bolin Ranch and you pay like $4 for your car, and then you drive in about half a mile and you park your car and you walk two miles into the canyons mountains and follow the trail down and the river from all the melting rain and you snow from the mountains flows down and you get a river.\n\n\r\nSo, you gotta cross the river and the river's probably from here to the sidewalk over there wide and it never gets any higher than this.\n\n Well, it does when the rains first melt, you can get this high and it's pretty cold.\n\n \r\nYou cross the river cold as hell and you get to the other side and there are all these natural hot springs that are coming out of the mountains and all these natural pools, and there are about five of them.\n\n It's all hot springs, so you get to go and they're all places to dive off of these rocks into the cold.\n\n So, you go from the hot to the coal and you get to swim around.\n\n \r\nMen, wear some drawers or something, or keep your penis protected because there are catfish in there and they bite.\n\n I got a bad bite once, immediately bled because catfish have teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShould ate him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLaurie did.\n\n \r\nThis is wild.\n\n If you want to spend the night there, it's illegal.\n\n Don't do it on a weekend because the Rangers come in on horseback and they'll ticket you at $80 and they tell you you have to leave, but $80 is like a good hotel.\n\n\r\nI've never gotten bused for renting night there during the week, but a lot of people get run off on the weekend.\n\n Too crowded on the weekend.\n\n\r\nIt's San Bernardino State Park.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe have lots of hot springs down there.\n\n**[Aajonus],[unclear 18:45 if u wanna try and hear it]**\n\r\nAnd then this place has one, it's called, \n, and it's right there.\n\n I mean, if you broke the rocks off, the cold water and the hot water would be running together, same level.\n\n And they've got a very deep one where you have to climb a little bit and it's probably about 8 feet deep.\n\n .\n\n\r\nAnd then one's up on top, really hot, very hot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you drink the formula before you go into the bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then afterwards you need exercises.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, on that side you've got a trail that leads all the way down to the dam, which is about 12 miles?\n\n So you've got plenty of trail, they're fire roads.\n\n That's a fire road.\n\n\r\nIt's a very easy walk and that's pretty flat.\n\n Not like when you come in from Bolin Ranch, you don't wanna walk 12 miles, you just wanna walk two miles.\n\n That is mostly downhill, on the way back it's uphill.\n\n\r\nBetter make sure you have enough food for as many days as you're gonna get back there cause you're gonna need your fuel to get back.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Hair Greying From Toxins \n \ngray hair\r\ndetox\r\nhair\n \n \n \n### (23) Mercury In Fish \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEach of the animals, like we had like five times in that 24-hour period, and then three days after we had examined everything\n\n And the amount of mercury that was in the fish before cooked and everything, just the concentration of different parts of the tissue, was all put together and divided and then equally that was shared among all the animals in that 24 hour period.\n\n \r\nAnd then the feces and urine was collected to measure the amount of mercury in the feces and urine.\n\n And in the ones who ate it raw, it was 96% - 98% discharge from the urine and feces.\n\n The fat molecules that held the mercury in suspension were relatively undigested.\n\n\r\nSo, the body can identify and pass it right through.\n\n But then the animals who ate the cooked swordfish, only 8% came out, at worst than 12%.\n\n So, 8% - 12%.\n\n Only 8% - 12% came out of their bodies.\n\n So, all that rest of that mercury was poisoning.\n\n\r\nAs long as you eat the fish raw, you're not gonna get, probably that other 4% to 8% was discharged through perspiration and right out through the skin.\n\n And that's all common sense that that.\n\n So, there was no evidence that stored the body when you eat it raw, lots of evidence against of it stored.\n\n\r\nOf course, we didn't scrape the skin to find out cause the cats and dogs had too much hair.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Organic Eggs, Where To Get Eggs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's like calling all of these eggs organic, organic, organic\n\n These eggs aren't organic, 75% - 80% of the feed is soy and even though it was raised organically, you can't feed raw soy to a chicken.\n\n \r\nIt has to be heat processed and chemically treated.\n\n Once you do that, the soy that you're feeding the chicken is no longer organic, nor is it anywhere natural.\n\n It's all a life.\n\n, it's an absolute fraud.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere do you get eggs then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI get Lilies eggs and they raise out on the land eating bugs and stuff like that, and she feeds them very little soy?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what should I ask for when I'm on the East coast when I'm looking for eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, just try to find chickens that have been running out on pasture?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Question about the eggs at Rawsome that were regular garbage eggs labeled as organic sold to the food club],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe results were decreased tremendously.\n\n In fact, they were getting sicker.\n\n Some of the cancer clients that were eating it progressed rapidly into more cancer and the literature out there on the internet, if you wanna look up soy is tremendous.\n\n\r\nThe amount of laboratory animals that get cancer by eating isoflavones.\n\n Cause it's high in isoflavones, especially when they're isolated and treated like that.\n\n Cause a human has to have it treated too and cleaned with chemicals cuz it would kill us if we, ate it raw.\n\n So, the same way we treat the chickens is the same way they treat them for us.\n\n\r\nThe isoflavones are very isolated and they're free radical basically and all animals that are fed, the cancer rate increases like 36%.\n\n It's an astounding amount.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Plaque and Toxins Go Into Brain \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo much more plaque\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMost of your toxic metals are in the brain.\n\n The brain is 60% fat, it's higher than any other place in the body except for the bone marrow and most of the toxins go into the bone marrow and brain.\n\n The body tries to defend the bone marrow and restrict poisons going there cuz that's where you breed with red, white blood cells and stem cells.\n\n\r\nSo, the brain is the most polluted part of the body.\n\n We also have the 80,000 years ago is when we started developing such a large brain and that coincides with the amount of cooking that had been done and starting to melt and use pottery and stuff like that where they were using kilns where you've got this poisonous vapor with heavy metals breathing into your lungs.\n\n\r\nSo, the brain seemed to develop under the amount of pollution that that man was subjecting himself to\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Saltwater \n \n \n \n \n### (27) Skin Brushing \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's awful\n\n When I've looked at skin brushings under a microscope, it just lacerates new skin.\n\n So, what you've done is created a scar or tissue of the new skin.\n\n So, it's always best to use cotton or silk wash cloth.\n\n And after you've got all that dead skin very moist, you can just rub it off and then you're taking care of that new skin.\n\n \r\nBut you put a brush on there, even the natural bristles, just cause scratching.\n\n Just like if you had a rash and you were scratching yourself and you created all this very light scab all over does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut the old dry skin does come up with it though, don't you agree.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but it damages the new skin?\n\n So, it's slightly hardened and scarred and that's affects the next generation that's bred.\n\n It also impedes that generation from reproducing itself.\n\n\r\nSilk cloth.\n\n\r\nYour raw silk.\n\n I know some people in Tibet, and they use wool wash cloth.\n\n\r\nLittle rough, but it doesn't cause scratches.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Sunabthing and Coconut Oil \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about when you lie in the sun then\n\n Cause I'm thinking about that, when you lie in the sun you sit just like you do in a sauna,?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut you don't have that hot heat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I dunno about that here in San Diego.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not 168°.\n\n\r\nThe lowest area I measured, probably not my own cause I don't have one.\n\n But when I've gone to Ivy Hot Springs, I've gone to Murrieta Hot Springs, all these places and gyms that I've gone to, all those, when I've measured the different layers in the sauna.\n\n The highest one I ever was in was 186° at the top.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if you lie down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd then as you go down, It decreased, the lowest was 120°.\n\n That's hot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut what about you lying in the sun though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're not gonna get over 100°?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt feels the same temperature.\n\n I understand what you're saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt feels hot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt feels very hot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause you got metals, like you have a car, you go out and touch a car with a dark paint job, it's gonna be really hot.\n\n If it's a light colored car, it's not gonna be as hot.\n\n And when you've got heavy metals coming out: lead, mercury, any of those, they absorb the sun and they become very hot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's all right in the sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll be okay, it's going to be hot on your body?\n\n And it's going to burn the cells, but it's not gonna bake into your skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause I do a lot of that in the summer and I thought that might be bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, but you can rinse those off so you won't burn so much from the sun.\n\n\r\nAnd also, if you put the coconut oil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI put the lubricating, I always put your lubrication formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPut the coconut oil on, now that we have the coconut oil and when it comes out, it has to go through a layer of oil to get to your skin and it's not going to happen and you can rinse yourself off too and it won't because it'll be cooler water, it's not gonna rinse off the oil.\n\n It's only gonna rinse off the metals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm at the beach, is that bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the salt water will wash off the oils?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I put it on again.\n\n Yeah.\n\n And I'm just trying to get it straight now.\n\n Even though I hear what you say, I feel hotter in the sun than I would in the sauna.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's all because of the metal refractory.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) What Races Have The Best Skin \n

travel, unless it's in an Asian country and they're poor\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause commercial chickens are mostly fed soy as a protein source and even though they say it's organic, the soy was raised organically, in order to feed chicken, soy, you have to process it and use a chemical treatment?\n\n Otherwise, raw soy kills any bird, all poultry.\n\n Just like raw soy will kill a human, so it has to be solvent and heat treated, so it's a highly processed food, so I don't eat chickens that are fed a lot of soy, nor eggs from chickens that are fed a lot of soy.\n\n\r\nIf it's over 25% - 30% soy, I don't touch the eggs or the chicken.\n\n That's why I don't eat birds.\n\n Well, I know I can call those people right away.\n\n That's not a problem.\n\n I can find out.\n\n If it doesn't say organic, that's what I'll buy.\n\n It says organic, I won't buy the eggs.\n\n \r\nFor eggs, I'd use just the opposite, non-organic, because they're lying.\n\n They're saying that those chickens are organic by feeding them the organically raised soy.\n\n They're not feeding them organically grown soy.\n\n They're not feeding them the organic soy in its form that it was produced organically.\n\n \r\nIt's a chemical treated product, so it's a lie.\n\n It's not only a misnomer, it's a lie.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, buy eggs that don't say organic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause everyone that's organic will be feeding it 75% - 80% soy and those that don't feed it organic are feeding it 25% - 35% soy?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat are the other people feeding them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey feed corn and other grains, animal food products?\n\n\r\nAnd that's what they should do.\n\n My farmers who I get my eggs from feed them rotten meat cuz chickens are scavengers, that's what they eat.\n\n They like rotten meat.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou said that James was getting a new source today.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe've got a new source?\n\n He feeds them no soy.\n\n, We don't buy Lilies anymore.\n\n\r\nLilies is still better, they only feed there's 25% soy, but we've got a better source now.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat place.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJames won't gimme the name, nor the the place?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Puts Chlorine Off \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nChlorine and such\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDrinking Gerolsteiner,  Perrier, any one of those, San Pellegrino, any of those naturally sparkling waters will help get rid of the chloroform vapor that results from chlorine.\n\n\r\nBut if you want to be really tricky, like me, when I go to a hotel and I want to use their swimming pool, I'll sneak into their their pump room and turn off the chlorination and I'll take a few grapefruits and juice them and then pour that into the swimming pool that evening, and I'll be able to swim the next day.\n\n But then I can only do that for three days before they start noticing the algae starting to turn green everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, rotten chicken at theaters, grapefruit at pools.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n.\n \n

\n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBird flu\n\n \r\nIt's the most ridiculous thing in the world.\n\n There's bird flu, but bird flu is a virus.\n\n Virus you cannot communicate, virus is a soap.\n\n They're not alive.\n\n Virus are protein bodies that cause the dissembling of structure.\n\n\r\nSo, if your body cannot use bacteria or parasites or fungus to disassemble some particular structure of the body, cellular structure or other tissue structure, even fluid structures, then the cells themselves will manufacture a virus, a solvent, to break that down and disintegrate it.\n\n \r\nNow, the virus come into play when the body is too toxic.\n\n If the body's too toxic, let's say with mercury or lead, arsenic, could be even too high in sodium, from salts or iodine.\n\n\r\nIf the bacteria eats the degenerative: tissue, parasites, bacteria, or fungus, it destroys those bodies.\n\n It destroys the bacteria, the fungus, or the parasite, so that they cannot maintain that a normal environment of being our janitors.\n\n\r\nThe body will make its own soaps, which are virus, to dissolve that tissue and to remove it from the system.\n\n That is the least desirable of any cleansing, but it still is a detoxification, a cleansing.\n\n \r\nNormally a parasite will eat degenerative tissue or dead tissue, and they can eat a 100x their weight in 24 hours and they'll excrete only about 1% - 5%.\n\n \r\nSo, it's like if we ate 100 pounds of food, and had a one pound feces the next day.\n\n The body has very little to decontaminate.\n\n Instead of having 100%, it has 1% to decontaminate it with the help of the parasites.\n\n\r\nBacteria, it can eat about 50x it's weight in 24 hours and it excretes anywhere from 5% - 10%.\n\n So, still the waste is incredibly reduced.\n\n If we ate seven pounds of food in a day, we'd have about a pound excrement the next day.\n\n \r\nSo, if you compare us to parasites and, and bacteria, you see that the ratio of help of decontamination, of reducing the waste product is pretty immense.\n\n\r\nSo, parasites are very favorable if you know how to take care of yourself.\n\n If you don't and your body has to use the solvents, the virus to help you cleanse, the problem is just like if you go to use a solvent to clean the grease off of your carport or driveway or garage, what happens.\n\n\r\nYou take a large amount of fluid, you put a degreaser down and you mop it up, you clean it, and then what do you have remaining?\n\n You have about two and a half gallons of toxic waste?\n\n The human body does the same thing.\n\n Your body has to use a lot of fluids to utilize the virus properly, to break the tissue down, to dissolve it, and when it disassembles and makes it diluted like that, it contaminates the whole body.\n\n\r\nFor example, if you look at spinal meningitis and cerebral meningitis, if it's bacterial, the doctors don't worry about it.\n\n If it's viral, the doctors panic about it because it causes tremendous swelling and seizures and paralysis.\n\n\r\nSo, a virus passing from a bird to a human is an absurdity.\n\n Cells in your body make virus.\n\n You can make a human virus, you can't make a bird virus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThen why don't they test it.\n\n Why do they say it is  the same virus?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it's all a hoax?\n\n They're getting ready to sell a vaccine for $7 billion.\n\n It's all about money.\n\n\r\nI'm gonna send an email in my next Primal Diet newsletter.\n\n I will show you the documentation where the FDA is putting an office in every country because you have to understand that every country looks to United States science as the most advanced and most respectable and authoritative.\n\n\r\nSo, these other countries aren't doing any tests.\n\n Those people who are showing up in Asia to do these tests, are volunteers for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n They have nothing to do with the health departments.\n\n \r\nThe FDA's connections with the pharmaceutical industry go back 30 years.\n\n The last 11 heads of the FDA went on to be executives with a pharmaceutical company.\n\n The tie is immense, so it's all about selling a bird flu.\n\n \r\nYou remember the swine flu in the 70s.\n\n They were blaming a swine flu?\n\n You know the pig flu.\n\n Everybody was going to get it?\n\n President Ford went on and took the the swine flu shot right on tv.\n\n Who was our vice president.\n\n Rockefeller?\n\n What does Rockefeller own.\n\n Five pharmaceutical houses?\n\n We bought $7 billion of swine flu.\n\n Thankfully, here in San Diego we had two people who were very interested and got the word out.\n\n \r\nIda Honoraf was a consumer advocate and she was syndicated at about 180 major radio stations.\n\n And she talked about all the bad things and the good things for the consumer, whether it was food and she predominantly went on food.\n\n\r\nBut whether it was car industry products, no matter what it was.\n\n So, she was a very well respected woman  and Dr.\n\n McBean from San Diego got together with Ida Honoraf and they filed suit against the FDA, the surgeon General, the president and the vice president about this swine flu and said, you watch, you give this swine flu to people and people are gonna start dropping dead.\n\n\r\nSo ,since Ida Honoraf had all that publicity that syndicate, every newspaper listened to her.\n\n So they were right there on the administrative lines when the swine flu was being given.\n\n The first two weeks, 2,300 people died within two and a half days of receiving the swine flu as a direct result of having the swine flu, they shut the whole program down and guess who has 7 billion of swine flu in the vaults.\n\n That's right, we do and we pay for the storage of it?\n\n \r\nGuess what's coming out of the Avion flu relabeled.\n\n The swine flu vaccine is being relabeled as Avion, and we're gonna pay $8 billion for it this time because that's what Bush said he's going to do?\n\n\r\nI investigated the plants where they said they were going to produce it.\n\n None of them could produce it in the time slot that they said they could.\n\n There's no way, unless it was already a made substance and the only only flu vaccine in the vaults is that one that has that quantity.\n\n\r\nSo, it's very obvious what they're going to do.\n\n They don't like paying about probably $13 million dollars a year to store that swine flu, taking up all that space, so they want to get rid of it.\n\n They're not gonna lose money on it.\n\n\r\nThey said everybody's gonna get the swine flu, nobody got it.\n\n\r\nYou have to understand a virus is not alive, doesn't live.\n\n If they spray a solvent in the air, you're not going to breathe, it's not gonna hold up very well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut they can give it to use in the jab.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf they inject it in you, yes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut no other way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight?\n\n But I mean, if they make a virus, what they are giving you, it's a breed.\n\n If they cause a virus to be manufactured that was manufactured from a bird, you will have the Avian flu because you're injecting it into.\n\n \r\nJust like if you get polio vaccine, you're getting polio from a money because they breed the polio virus, or they make the polio virus by infecting monkey tissue.\n\n Then they separate that, they sterilize it, purify it, mix the thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum with it.\n\n Those are just three of the nasty contaminants and they put that in there and they  inject it in you.\n\n\r\nSo yes, you can get a flu, but it has to be injected in you.\n\n That's the only way you can get a foreign flu.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause some of it was given by the mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, the salt vaccine.\n\n But your body was able to break that up, but there was lots of disease caused by the salt vaccine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you don't believe there's gonna be a pandemic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can't have a pandemic of flu, it's impossible?\n\n\r\nCells can't make it like that.\n\n All of your vaccines are a hoax, every one of them.\n\n There's no evidence, and you'll notice every time they come out with a vaccine, the disease is already gone.\n\n Cause they know if they produce the vaccine and give you the vaccine while the disease is still in it's growth factor.\n\n.\n\n\r\nAnyway, while it's still on the rise, they will never give any kind of a vaccine, because the vaccine will cause the disease to be worse and it'll kill a lot of people.\n\n So, they always wait till the disease is almost gone.\n\n If you look at the records on whooping cough, smallpox, any of those, when those were so-called pandemics at the time, they were all gone.\n\n They were down to almost the 1% level before the vaccines came out.\n\n It's money, it's all about money.\n\n It has nothing to do with health.\n\n Vaccines are the worst thing you can do to anybody in your life, especially children.\n\n \r\nAnd they blame fish for all the mercury.\n\n In one vaccine, there have been 67,000 trillion molecules of mercury.\n\n Do you know how much fish you would have to eat.\n\n Let's say, swordfish?\n\n You'd have to eat about 1 million pounds of swordfish in your lifetime to get what you get in two vaccines of mercury.\n\n So again, the medical profession and the government is trying to move the people's minds out of suing the pharmaceutical houses and the government for requiring governments for requiring vaccines because of all the mercury contamination from vaccines.\n\n\r\nAnd, in California, there's 68 vaccines required by the time the child is 15.\n\n5 years old.\n\n In some states it's 120 vaccines by the time they reach that age.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Brain Used Metallic Minerals, Cooked Food Turns To Free Radiclas \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe brain uses the most metallic minerals because metallic minerals are used to convey electricity and light, and that's the method of the nervous system\n\n That's its object, to transport information, sensation, stimulation, all through electrical and electricity, and light.\n\n That's dependent upon metallic minerals.\n\n\r\nMetallic minerals need very little to do that.\n\n However, when you cook a food, you cause the metallic minerals in it to be free radical.\n\n So, whether it's mercury, lead, iron, cadmium, any of the heavy metals, once it is a free radical, that means that it has no way of knowing its place in structure.\n\n And when you cook, you destroy enzymes and vitamins and everything that makes the basic structure of where that element is used.\n\n\r\nSo, since the brain and nervous system use most metallic minerals, If your body can't discard it and get rid of it because it doesn't have the fats to do it, or the proteins and the elements to make the enzymes to escort it out of the body or perspire it out or discharge it out the mucus membranes or the feces or the urine to get rid of it some way, it stores in the nervous system and brain.\n\n\r\nThe brain detoxifies mainly through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands and the eyes.\n\n So, if that's discharging like that, if it's discharging out the tear ducts and it goes through the eyeball itself, it's going to create macular degeneration.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Cardboard For Radiation \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, but he's supposed to be putting cardboard between that and the food\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, he does not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then you call him and you say you have to put cardboard between.\n\n Cause I tell him he has to.\n\n\r\nDon't allow it.\n\n He doesn't do it to me because I don't allow it.\n\n\r\nI say, you put a cardboard between that and my food.\n\n Don't you dare put that next to my food.\n\n \r\nYou've gotta have a piece of cardboard or something between.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Century Eggs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, rotten eggs are good\n\n The Chinese and the Asian,  they have their century eggs, 25 years old rotten eggs.\n\n They're very expensive and they're very good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey don't go bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust remember any raw food never goes bad: it just ages, it molds, the earth digests it in different ways, whether it's predigested with molds, soil bacteria, whatever it does?\n\n\r\nNow, the Chinese, when they do their century eggs, they bury them in different kinds of soil.\n\n Some are black and some are white, so the molds that get inside predigest all the protein and the fats.\n\n So, that like when these old oxygenarians eat the century egg, may pay $1000 for a 25 year old egg.\n\n\r\nHe can have an orgasm two times a day for 28 days, and it's worth it to him, that's his Viagra.\n\n He'll pay $1000 for one of those eggs because every molecule of that protein is completely fractionated.\n\n So, every particle of protein and fat can be completely absorbed and utilized in the human body.\n\n\r\nYou take them by closing your eyes, putting a nose clip on your nose, and you eat them.\n\n I've eaten them.\n\n Gave me too much energy.\n\n I couldn't handle them.\n\n I'll eat rotten eggs, but not those, those are too much.\n\n I'll be a sex fiend, even.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nI wonder why we don't see too many girlfriends for too long\r\n\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nEvery summer we've had a problem where the eggs when I get 'em.\n\n They turn black inside.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose are good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThose you want.\n\n They're already predigested?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAll right.\n\n Oh God.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou've got a mold in there that's predigested.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI just had hard time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you close your nose to them, it'll just taste like an overly salted hard boiled egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, this wasn't hard, it was mushy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know, but that's what it tastes like, an overly salted, hard boiled egg.\n\n As long as your nose is closed.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nMine tastes slightly like chocolate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, there's some that will.\n\n bolting.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut it taste slightly salty.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's a different kind of mold.\n\n That's from salmonella, that's a good salmonella bacteria.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Coconut Water Bloating \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWater in it anymore cause it causes bloating\n\n \r\nI was wondering why all these Asians don't drink this coconut water, they just break it and throw it away.\n\n And I was having 4 of those a day and after a month I started getting ankle and feet swelling.\n\n.\n\n\r\nAnd that's why they don't, cause it causes swelling.\n\n \r\nIt takes a lot more time to drain the water out, it takes a lot of time in the process of making coconut cream.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Eating Humans \n \n \n \n \n### (10) Ecoli To Dissolve Brain Tumors \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, once you put the water over the egg, all of the reproduction of the cell stops instantly\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if I just wanna wash and eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's okay, but I mean, the fecal matter is supposed to be good for you.\n\n All animals eat fecal matter, except for humans.\n\n All animals every day eat fecal matter and dirt every day.\n\n\r\nAnd like I said, I quoted in the book from the University of Toronto, they've been using e coli to completely shrink and dissolve human brain tumors in 2 - 5 days.\n\n But there's no money in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, they charge $10,000 in injection.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's salmonella?\n\n See, they haven't even marketed it.\n\n\r\nThey've marketed only bacteria for that cancer treatment and that's the through Yale University.\n\n They attenuated the salmonella, so that normally the salmonella will go in to stop and the flow of oxygen to a tumor and then will start eating up the tumor.\n\n\r\nThey attenuated, so the salmonella will not eat the tumor, just stop the oxygen inflow and outflow from the tumor.\n\n Then they inject $12,000 of solvent into your tumor to dissolve it, which is highly toxic.\n\n \r\nSo, instead of you just rotting your eggs and letting salmonella grow and eating it, they want you to spend $20,000.\n\n\r\n$8,000 for an injection of the attenuated salmonella, then $12,000 for an injection of the toxins to dissolve the tumor.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Essential Oils, Coconut Oil Winderness Family Naturals \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI think they're very toxic and very dangerous optimally\n\n \r\nNow, the average person out there is eating very bad oils that are processed at very high temperatures.\n\n So, if you're using Young's oils, they're distilled at 270°.\n\n That's lower than any other oil, so it's better oil for the person who doesn't get good oil, but it's still not a good oil because once an oil is distilled, a cell does not have a choice to absorb it or not.\n\n It penetrates the cell, so the cell has no option and it destroys and damages lungs and mucus membranes, all kinds of things.\n\n \r\nAnd you see the people I've seen who use those essential oils a lot are ultra sensitive to everything.\n\n Oh, they become very sensitive and irritable.\n\n\r\nWell, you can use the coconut oil from wildernessfamilynaturals.\n\n**[no longer good, it's heated to a higher temperature]**\n and it's called the Filipino fermented coconut oil.\n\n \r\nIt took me six months to talk that fellow into lowering the temperature to 96°.\n\n So, he makes it a 96°.\n\n It's never taken over 96°.\n\n \r\nWell, anytime you're putting another oil in it, you're putting a manufactured distilled and usually solvent treated oil that has to meet the FDA's regulation for purity.\n\n \r\nThe best thing to do is just use the coconut oil, it smells wonderful.\n\n Smells like coconut.\n\n Ginger juice, you can put in, like I put in the Primal Facial Body Care Cream.\n\n Just put a few drops in the oil.\n\n\r\nI found a new, I found a new lip gloss treatment.\n\n What you do is take about six ounces of the honey, the thicker honeys like the sage, and you put one teaspoon to one tablespoon of coconut cream in it, so it's slightly creamy, and you rub that on your lips and it tastes very good.\n\n Especially after it's set for about a day and it completely relieves any wrinkling, it helps hydrate the lips and the so-called dehydration that you normally feel in the lips will disappear for almost 24 hours.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Fat In Thailand \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAbsolutely\n\n When I'm in Thailand, I'll go to these markets where all the flies are all over everything, and that's the stuff I want, and they'll hang it there with this strips of fat.\n\n You'll never find this in our market.\n\n You've got a strip of of meat here and it's about 1/3 or 1/4 meat and the rest is all this fat.\n\n\r\nAnd they look at this white boy,and I'll say, I'll say in English, cause I don't know the Thai words for the fat yet, and I don't know why I haven't learned it, but I haven't.\n\n And I'll say, \"The fat\", and then they'll cut off the fat and gimme the meat and I'll say, \"No, no, no.\n\n I don't want the meat.\n\n I want the fat\".\n\n And they think I'm crazy because most white people just don't want any fat on anything.\n\n\r\nAnd it's dirt cheap.\n\n I paid for five pounds of good fat and with a little meat.\n\n I paid like $5 for 2.\n\n5 kilos.\n\n\r\nSo, that's about seven pounds.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) FDA Corruption \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe FDA is putting an office in every country, because you have to understand that every country looks to United States science as the most advanced and most respectable and authoritative\n\n So, these other countries aren't doing any tests.\n\n The Americans bring their, and it's those people who are showing up in Asia to do these tests are volunteers for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\r\nThey have nothing to do with the health departments.\n\n The FDA's connections with the pharmaceutical industry go back 30 years.\n\n The last 11 heads of the FDA went on to be executives with the pharmaceutical company.\n\n The tie is immense, so it's all about selling a bird flu.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Finding Eggs, Free Range &cage Free \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI would go to a health food store and pick the worst option there\n\n\r\nIt wouldn't say vegetarian fed and it wouldn't say organic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nProbably the cheapest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably?\n\n\r\nTrader Joe's goes off and on with who they buy from, so you have to keep up with who they're buying from and what those chickens are fed.\n\n \r\nRange free.\n\n But range doesn't mean- that's all garbage language again, it's a misnomer.\n\n They can put 'em in a room like your kitchen and call that range free.\n\n Range means they're allowed to roam, that doesn't mean on a range like we normally think of a range, just means that they have a range of space.\n\n A range of space.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith another thousand chickens.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, and they could be not touching sunlight, not out in the wild at all or on cement floor, that's free range or cage free, it's the same thing.\n\n \r\nIf you say pastured, that's different.\n\n They have to be on grass, they have to be on dirt.\n\n Pasture raised are the best, pastured eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Goji Berries \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, goji berries are a berry that's produced on a bush\n\n They're said to have properties to reverse quite a few diseases.\n\n And in my research in the tribes who use them, cultures who use them, yes, they had a lot of medicinal properties as long as they were either dried in the sun and eaten or juiced fresh.\n\n\r\nBut any time if it were steeped or cooked in any way, it reduced the efficacy by 60%.\n\n When it's processed like for distribution in our commercial when it has the FDA's approval of sanitary, it's effective in maybe 10% - 12% of the people.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're going to eat goji berries, get them dried, sun dried, or the powder and steep it in some water, but sun steep it so it's soaks in the water, some other way to utilize them other than cooking and processing.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Government Overreach, Getting Food In The Future \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI think it's very eminent, I think in about seven years it's definitely going to be\n\n\r\nWe have our network of food connection and these people own the farms, so we're protected\r\nWe're protected for a while, for about seven years.\n\n Probably about seven years we'll get by, but after that, I don't know.\n\n Either we change or the government.\n\n\r\nThailand, Cambodia, Laos; very poor countries they have very little interest in.\n\n Laos is probably the least available to because there's not enough people who live there.\n\n There's not a lot of population to enslave, Cambodia's the same way.\n\n Thailand's got a lot of people, that's why they're infiltrating them.\n\n\r\nThailand's been in cahoots with the US government since the Vietnam War, heavily.\n\n That King knows that if he doesn't do what those bankers say and the people who run the US government, he won't have a land, he won't have a kingdom.\n\n So, he lets them in and he lets them do too much.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich country is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThailand?\n\n\r\nThere are organic seeds, that's not true.\n\n There are about 23 companies that have heirloom seeds.\n\n You go on the internet and you find 23 to 26 companies.\n\n The big companies are still trying to buy them all out, but they're not selling.\n\n\r\nThey bought up over somewhere around 2000- when I last read 2,700 of those seed companies, Dow and Monsanto.\n\n There's only 23 - 27 left in this country.\n\n\r\nLike I say, you have to have a close network with a farm, you have to be in farm country.\n\n\r\nYou'll have to go up north in California if you're in California, or you have to go east anywhere to Pennsylvania and then beyond Pennsylvania.\n\n Well, in Virginiam there's a lot of Amish and Mennonites all through the south.\n\n There are lots of farm.\n\n \r\nThere's not a lot that's not owned by Dow, Monsanto, and Warners, and what's that other big agricultural company.\n\n They own most of the agricultural land now?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nArcher Daniels.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they own crops, but not as much farmland, but that's a company that is getting heavily into it?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Hot Water Bottle, Brain Swelling \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, so let's say you are lying on one side, you put the hot water bottle here, you put a towel, a small hand towel that goes over that and over both eyes\n\n Leave your nose or mouth out so you can breathe and that'll maintain the heat just in that localized area of the head and eye.\n\n\r\nIt'll cause the heat to go in so all the muscles in the eye and then the head, everywhere will relaxed.\n\n More blood and neurological fluid and lymph can go into that area to clean the area and to bring more nutrients into the area, so you can ensure better reversal of the macular degeneration and the prevention and healing of it by that.\n\n\r\nBut a raw diet, I mean a good raw diet with raw meat and lots of raw fat is the only way I know that you're going to actually be able to reverse it and stop it or stop it and then reverse it.\n\n\r\nWell, you can do it every night.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm sorry.\n\n Can you go over that again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou place it near that, just not against, It can be right near, right barely touching?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause the hollow.\n\n You could have it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you don't want it touching at all?\n\n You don't want touching your skin.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're not touching the eye, but touching the- \r\n\n\r\nNot even touching your head.\n\n\r\nYou want it on the pillow or bed right beside you, not touching your body.\n\n Only thing that'll touch your body is that towel that goes over your head.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're gonna move sometimes away from it during the night?\n\n So.\n\n you could be there for a half an hour, you could be there for two hours or five hours.\n\n Your body will move away when it wants to, if it feels the increase in circulation is getting too large.\n\n\r\nLet's say you have some cirrhosed tissue in the brain and if you have too much swelling in the brain, you could have an aneurysm and you could have a blood vessel burst in the vein, you better believe your body's not gonna allow you to stay there around the hot water bottles for very long.\n\n You're gonna move in your sleep away from it, unless your body's completely stupid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does that have to do with bursting a blood vessel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHeat causes increased circulation, that causes swelling everywhere?\n\n You've got it here, it's gonna cause swelling in the brain, goes back into the eye all the way into the brain.\n\n If you have too much swelling in the brain and you have cirrhosed tissue in the brain, dried areas, the circulation could cause a fracture of a blood vessel.\n\n\r\nYour body will move away from it, unless you live on donuts and you're a police officer.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nIt depends, if it's moving from your brain out your eyelids, yes.\n\n If it's moving from your tear ducts, then it's moving from the eye itself.\n\n\r\nYou could do an analysis, it will cost you $2,300.\n\n\r\nI can give you the laboratory.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut have you had good results of people that have done this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor the ones who will do it?\n\n The ones that do that practice, it helps quicker.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAn actual reversal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's a reversal?\n\n Well, it goes into cessation first, and then reversal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you see it on the iridology.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I can?\n\n Well, I can see macular degeneration in the tissue from the pupil.\n\n\r\nYou put it here and you can put pressure up into your temple, it's not what you want.\n\n You want everything to be open for even flow of nutrients.\n\n Cuz you could cause a certain area to blister and bubble, bruise it.\n\n So, you don't wanna put it directly on, ever.\n\n Same thing in the ear, you just lie on your back and you have it here or here.\n\n\r\nNot a towel.\n\n Well, you can put a towel in between, a towel over.\n\n Like if you had a hot water bottle here, you're lying back on your back and you've got the hot water bottle sitting right bottle sitting right next to your ear, you could drape a towel over this and your head over the hot water bottle on your head, and that'll keep the heat directly into your head area, your area.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that's the same thing for the neck.\n\n Don't put it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect, I do not put it on my neck?\n\n You do not put it on your neck.\n\n I say that in the book, never put it against your skin.\n\n\r\nYou put pressure there, it's gonna block the circulation you're trying to flow.\n\n\r\nIt could make it worse.\n\n\r\nI said put it next to your head and put the towel over.\n\n\r\nYou can if you like, dampen it.\n\n in a hot, oh, sorry.\n\n I just thank you.\n\n \r\nYou can get into a hot bath or a hot room, but that affects the whole area.\n\n Then you're dispersing all the nutrients that you've digested in a certain amount of time to a whole area, that doesn't concentrate on a troubled area.\n\n\r\nTo concentrate on a troubled area, which you want to clean and heal quickly you have to focus the heat to that area.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) How Much Vegetable Juic Per Day \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, it depends upon the individual\n\n Anywhere up to 4 cups a day, but as little as 1 cup a day.\n\n Depending upon the size of individual, 8 oz- 16 oz, or even 4 oz - 16 oz at a time.\n\n Sometimes I've had people that are 300 pounds and I tell 'em to drink a whole 24 oz first thing in the morning.\n\n\r\nBut the first juice, first juice for that person would be 24.\n\n Then the next one could be 12, next one could be 8, and then after that 8.\n\n Depends upon the individual.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy can't you do wheat grass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n It causes over alkalinity in the intestines and acidity in the blood, it turns the blood to acidic.\n\n \r\nWheatgrass juice is not a beneficial juice if you're on this diet.\n\n \r\nIf you're a vegetarian, you need that acidity in your blood cuz you won't reproduce red blood cells.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're a vegetarian or fruitarian, wheat grass can help you.\n\n\r\nBut if you eat any kind of meat, any kind of dairy, then you shouldn't be eating wheatgrass juice.\n\n**[unclear]**\n and parsley.\n\n Those are good green vegetables, leafy vegetables to get uoi chlorophyl and vitamin E.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Inflammatory Breast Cancer, Vegetable Oils \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDifferent kinds of breast cancer and what you do about it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA cancer cell is normally a cell that will form into a tumorous area around dead cells, and it'll form some kind of fibroid tissue?\n\n If the body decides that it doesn't want to build dead tissues into a fibroid tumor, it can start producing a serum or a bacteria, a solvent, a virus, or a bacteria to dissolve it right where it exists, and then that causes an inflammatory situation that's not localized to a tumor.\n\n \r\nThe whole breast can be involved and that often happens if the lymph system is complete completely failing, and that's getting more and more these days.\n\n \r\nThe more vegetable oils people eat, the more congested the lymphatic system is.\n\n\r\nAnimal fats do not create hardening of the arteries and heart disease.\n\n All the tribes who eat nothing but cooked meats and cooked animal products have no heart disease and no arterial sclerosis.\n\n \r\nPeople who eat cooked vegetables have arterial sclerosis.\n\n Vegetable oils in the human body, harden and crystallize over time.\n\n We do not have the body temperature of an herbivore, n animal that eats vegetation.\n\n They have a body temperature of 101° - 105°.\n\n\r\nOurs is 98.\n\n6° or lower, and most often lower.\n\n So, when we eat vegetable oils, especially hydrogenated, which means it's turned into plastic molecule, same molecular structure as plastic.\n\n \r\nWe take those in the body, they harden in the body.\n\n They dehydrate the area that they're contained in, and that means if it's part of the cell, the whole cell wall would become hardened.\n\n\r\nAnd what do you have.\n\n Cirrhosed tissue, hardening of the artery, hardening of the heart?\n\n We had very little heart disease when people were eating lard and bacon and stuff like that.\n\n Now that everybody's eating margarine and vegetable oil, heart disease is the number one killer.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Juicer, Green Power Gold, Mature Vs Yougn Coconuts \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's a very vinegary, very fermented one, and it'll cause lots of detox\n\n If you want to eat it, go for it.\n\n \r\nOh, you're not talking about vegetable juice.\n\n I thought you said vegetable juice?\n\n Meat okay.\n\n \r\nYou let it go for two months, you just have to start opening it again.\n\n \r\nStill use it.\n\n You have to start over.\n\n\r\nThat machine is a juicer that's this big and they use it in Thailand and all throughout Asia to make coconut cream.\n\n So, I bought the machine that you can take the hard shell off of a coconut in three seconds, plus a machine that takes the meat and grates it.\n\n You put that into the juicer, you can produce like 20 gallons of coconut cream an hour.\n\n \r\nI got it for a particular individual, he already paid me for it and it's been sitting there for six months unused.\n\n That's right.\n\n James has been sitting on it for six months, so I told him if he doesn't get it in action with, then by the time I go back to Thailand, I'm buying another set and I'm going to produce it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLocally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLocally, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, we'll have someone running up and getting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou probably won't charge as much as James.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends, I'm not going produce it myself?\n\n I'm not going to do the work, I'm gonna hire people to do it and that means getting a location to do it too.\n\n\r\nSo, whatever that costs is what it would be.\n\n \r\nWell, if you want to really produce it's better to go for the Green Power Gold machine.\n\n\r\nNo, immature coconuts will not give you coconut cream, that's just gel and water.\n\n It's gotta be the thick meat inside, the white thick meat.\n\n\r\nThose are young coconuts, those aren't mature coconuts.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, no.\n\n That's the husk that you see around it.\n\n Inside, when you break it open, the white thick, that is the meat.\n\n There's some that are jelly, which is the one you're talking about.\n\n\r\nThe jelly is okay to eat, but what he's talking about is a thick, tougher meat that coconut flakes are made from.\n\n It's a thick and it's tough to chew.\n\n That is what we're making the coconut cream from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd it's completely oval, it's not that coned edge, that's all young coconut.\n\n\r\nWell, the trick there is you go to a Spanish community area, they buy them frequently, but when you're in a white bred area, you never gonna get a good coconut, cuz they just don't eat enough of them.\n\n They've been over there on the shelf a long time.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Lymph Baths, Only 2 Days A Week \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nStimulating your lymph system\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn the book, We Want To Live, the primal diet, the expanded version, under lymphatic congestion?\n\n I tell you how to do the lymphatic baths.\n\n But only take them two days a week max.\n\n Never closer than three days apart because the amount of detoxification that'll occur, you could not keep up with.\n\n\r\nIt could cause you tremendous amount of fatigue, fibromyalgia, all kinds of problem.\n\n  \r\nIn the lymphatic baths, you stay in there anywhere from an hour - an hour and a half.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you said if I needed another bath at a shorter time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUp to 20 minutes, you could have 100x 20 minute baths a day if you want.\n\n But if you're going to do a forced lymphatic detoxification, that's anywhere from an hour - an hour and a half bath, and that's forced.\n\n That will force many things to dissolve in the lymphatic system, that'll melt all of that hardened vegetable oil that's clogged the arterial system and heart, in layers.\n\n\r\nAnd when that starts exuding.\n\n Your body has to get it out of the body quickly and the nutrients that are available are going to be limited.\n\n So, if you get too much out too frequently, you're going to be chronically fatigue and in fibromyalgia, you're gonna ache everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about a hot tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe same as the hot bath?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAs long it's not chlorine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n As long as it's not chlorine.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI can't last more than 20 minutes.\n\n I can't do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n That's how toxic your lymph system is.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Macular Degeneration, Eyewash, Mercury In Eyedrops \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's a difficult one because macular degeneration is eyes, it's in the eyes, it's muscles in the eye\n\n Macular degeneration is when the eye tissue is breaking down.\n\n That usually comes from the brain dumping its heavy metals out the tear ducts or somebody using an eyewash or a contact cleanser that has thimerosal, liquid mercury in it.\n\n\r\nAlways some toxin causes the breakdown of tissue, and it's always an industrial toxin.\n\n Only 10% of the diseases that exist today existed before industrial pollution.\n\n That means probably that cooked food attributed 10% of all the diseases exist today.\n\n The other 90% have come from waste products and the products of industrial manufacturing.\n\n\r\nThe brain uses the most metallic minerals because metallic minerals are used to convey electricity and light and that's the method of the nervous system.\n\n That's its object to transport information, sensation, stimulation, all through electrical and electricity and light.\n\n That's dependent upon metallic minerals.\n\n Metallic minerals need very little to do that.\n\n \r\nHowever, when you cook a food, you cause the metallic minerals in it to be free radical.\n\n So, whether it's mercury, lead, iron, cadmium, any of the heavy metals, once it is a free radical, that means that it has no way of knowing its place in structure.\n\n \r\nAnd when you cook, you destroy enzymes and vitamins and everything that makes the basic structure of where that element is used.\n\n So, since the brain and nervous system use most metallic minerals, if your body can't discard it and get rid of it because it doesn't have the fats to do it, or the proteins and the elements to make the enzymes to escort it out of the body or perspire it out or discharge it out the mucus membranes or the feces or the urine to get rid of it some way, it stores in the nervous system and brain.\n\n \r\nThe brain detoxifies mainly through the gums, the tongue, and the salivary gland and the eyes.\n\n So, if it's discharging out the tear ducts and it goes through the eyeball itself, it's going to create macular degeneration.\n\n\r\nIf you're washing your eyes with a wash for contacts or because your eyes get dry or red and you're using an eye wash that has thimerosal in it, it's liquid mercury.\n\n You're going to keep absorbing the mercury into the eyeball, and eventually it's going to damage your eyesight, young or old.\n\n And if it gets deeply into the eye, into the muscles of the eye, it'll cause macular degeneration.\n\n \r\nHow to reverse macular degeneration is very difficult because the circulation in the eyeball is very narrow.\n\n So, you have to have swollen eyes, and that's not comfortable to have, it blocks vision, and that's the only way you can quicken circulation and nutrients in the eyeball to help remove damaged tissue and to regenerate it.\n\n\r\nSo, it's difficult, but you could do it at night.\n\n One night, lie on one side and put the hot water bottles near your eye, not against it, cuz you don't wanna put pressure there.\n\n You want the heat to go to the area to cause swelling.\n\n \r\nSwelling is nothing other than increased circulation.\n\n Anytime you get an injury and you have swelling, do not run for the ice.\n\n If you do, you're gonna cause blood clotting, you're gonna cause the damaged, bruised tissue to remain in the area and that's why your athletes burn out in the late thirties.\n\n Because they've collected too much scar tissue and their injuries because their coach wanted them to play, so they put ice packs on them, so they can get out there and play again.\n\n Cuz as long as their is swelling there, the joints don't work as easily, so they're likely to fall out so they can't play well.\n\n So, they pack ice on their legs and knees, the arm the elbow, wherever it is.\n\n And then these people end up with scar tissue and not able to work past their 30s or 40s years old because all the accumulation of scar tissues.\n\n\r\nSo, do not use ice ever, unless it's just for a minute or two just to reverse some pain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about if you have burnt your hand quickly, just one bit on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you burnt it, well that's different?\n\n I'm talking about an injury, a bruise and that kind of swelling.\n\n But if you burn something, applying an opposite time, which is a few seconds or a minute of ice to that area, will actually reverse the burn in some situations.\n\n\r\nSo, that is the only time that I would ever use ice is on a burn and it has to be immediate, immediately after the burn.\n\n 10 minutes after a burn, it doesn't work anymore.\n\n It's too late.\n\n All the fluids have changed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you apply aloe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, to reverse a burn, it has to be the ice immediately to stop it?\n\n An ice cube straight on the burn, but it has to be within three minutes in most cases, in children, five minutes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIce packs and got freezer burn on my arm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they have a fluid which maintains the ability to stay cold longer, it's a chemical.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI believe ice would not have done that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it wouldn't have done that.\n\n I mean, leaving it on a while is gonna create a frostbite.\n\n But that's different.\n\n\r\nIt's usually radioactively involved.\n\n It's like you have certain substance, you can microwave it or heat it or freeze it, and it'll stay frozen longer and quicker.\n\n It's in the gel.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Meat While Travelling \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTake your butter, take your cheese, and take your honey\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd we can live on those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n You can get eggs anywhere, you can get meat anywhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey took my butter at the airport.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, where did you land.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI was in Rome?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, well, Italy's not gonna let you go in with agriculture.\n\n\r\nI guess if you wanna put it in your luggage X-ray, but you can ask them to handle it differently.\n\n You go to the airline officials and ask them to have it hand checked.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you use a doctors note.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean that they honor it all the time?\n\n You don't know until you do it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDairy's always the hardest, milk especially.\n\n\r\nEverything is processed.\n\n So, what staple can you buy that's universal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBest thing to do is go get avocados, eggs, meat and fatty meats?\n\n Just get lots of fatty meats.\n\n Ask them for the fat cuz they cut off fat all the time and they just throw it away.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, so when I'm buying meat now I want the fatty meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you swallow it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI bought a meat grinder?\n\n I grind up all my meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMaybe with honey would go down better.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Melanoma \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, melanomas can come from a lot of different irritations to the skin\n\n First you have to look at cancer.\n\n Cancer is a collection of dead cells.\n\n You've lost the ability to have parasites or bacteria or a fungus to dissolve the dead cells, so dead cells will then begin collect.\n\n Now that is where tumors form, collection of dead cells.\n\n\r\nIf it's benign, there's no cancer cells.\n\n If your body says, I want a chance to get rid of this tumor quickly, it'll make it into cancer, so I prefer cancer over a benign tumor.\n\n Just the opposite of medical profession because a cancer cell, when it dies, it lets out a solvent, identical to viruses that dissolves all the surrounding dead cells of the tumor.\n\n\r\nSo, you can have tumor dissolve in two days to two years.\n\n If you have a benign tumor, it can take 30 years to dissolve it cuz there's no blood vessels in it.\n\n There's no dead cell that have a solvent property about them, like cancer cells.\n\n So, your body has to eat away at it from the outside in slowly and gradually.\n\n\r\nBut when you have vessels going through a tumor, a malignant tumor, you have all those cancer cells and blood cells, so you can dissolve and eliminate it immediately.\n\n \r\nFor itchy skin.\n\n\r\nWell, it, it depends what your itchy skin is from.\n\n If your itchy skin is from a lack of fats, the sun can cause an irritation to the cells, rupture them, kill a lot of them, and cause melanoma to form, another melanoma can be formed from your body throwing, let's say mercury or aluminum or combination of, of aluminum and formaldehyde from vaccines, throwing it out from an injection and store it in your tissue somewhere and it comes out through the skin and dries it.\n\n That usually creates a hide that turns into a crust and then can turn into melanoma.\n\n \r\nSo, there are several varieties of melanoma nd it depends on what yours is from, or the person about whom you're speaking.\n\n It depends on what is in them that they have to detoxify.\n\n Could be heavy metals, could be just a lack of fat, good raw fat, that lubricates their skin.\n\n\r\nIf the sun created melanoma, every black person in the world would be dead  because of all the sun that they get.\n\n All the Asians that work in the fields, all the Mexicans who work in the fields, all the Latins who work in the fields that are subjected in the sun all day long, they'd all have melanoma, but it's rare.\n\n\r\nRare in them because they all eat some kind of fat; avocados or whatever it is, they eat some kind of raw fat that feeds the skin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Mucus, Allergies, Pollen \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, a lot of that's misconstrued as allergy\n\n Just have to remember, you have mucus to block particles that you breathe in that normally aren't part of food and they don't digest properly, pollution from, let's say a diesel truck, is not something that the body normally takes in.\n\n \r\nThe body can take pollens in, it can take organic matter and make it into food as part of the body locally.\n\n Our skin eats all the time.\n\n If you get particles in your mucus membranes that the body cannot break down and utilize in the system as food, then it will create mucus, excessive mucus to allow it to flow outward.\n\n \r\nAnd so it's an allergy in a sense, but our allergies, our oversensitivity to the natural pollens, which nobody should be allergic to have a reaction because we have too many industrial toxins stored in the tissue, which prevents certain enzymes from being formed to break a pollen down into a substance that could be food locally into that mucus membrane.\n\n \r\nSo, it's like taking antibiotics.\n\n You take antibiotics, you lose your intestinal flora and bacteria, you can't digest your normal food anymore.\n\n So, when we breathe in these  toxins: lead, dioxins; whatever they are, and they line our mucus membranes and get into our tissue and we get normal things that come into the system like pollen or dirt.\n\n Dirt is fine, everybody eats dirt.\n\n All animals eat dirt.\n\n But if we breathe it in with these toxins, we can't break it down properly, we can't utilize it properly.\n\n So, it becomes a problem in our system, so of course we flow with mucus to discharge it.\n\n\r\nAnd mucus is mainly to protect, to allow things not to enter the mucus membranes without proper slow decomposition and utilization and absorption in the system.\n\n It is now because we're so toxic and polluted, it's now a element of discharge, of excrement or secretion to get rid of toxins.\n\n\r\nIf you can't break it down, if you can't break those elements down, you want a runny nose.\n\n If you don't have a runny nose, those elements get into your tissues and they'll cause cirrhosed tissue, a hardening of your mucus membranes, which leads to cirrhosis or cirrhosis tissue.\n\n \r\nI don't know why they only refer to cirrhosis of the liver, but you have cirrhosis in all MS, that's multiple sclerosis.\n\n Cirrhosis tissue means hardened tissue, so it can apply to anything.\n\n So, cirrhosis could be of anything, but they only apply it for some reason to liver.\n\n I know quite a few people, especially Asians, who don't have any sense of smell or sense of taste because they've used the American medical system's way of Dristan sulfur products that dry out their sinuses.\n\n\r\nCan you imagine going through life not able to taste or smell.\n\n Everything is like cardboard?\n\n Everything you taste, no flavor to it, no smell, no fragrance.\n\n That's quite a loss in life.\n\n \r\nSo, allow the mucus to discharge, just say, well, that's part of my being.\n\n Now.\n\n I will go through life blowing my nose and having mucus discharge.\n\n \r\nOf course, if you go on a good.\n\n Such as this one, your chances are 95% that will only happen for so many years.\n\n The people who've gotten on this diet with emphysema, asthma, allergies, they're all through it by 6.\n\n5 years, never happens to them again.\n\n \r\nIf they come in with the allergies and not emphysema, usually two and a half years, they may only have a short occurrence of it at the heaviest bee pollen season.\n\n So, it may last 10 days, two weeks at the most, and it's usually a 10th of what they suffered before, so they have no problem with it.\n\n Then after about 6.\n\n5 years, then there's no problem.\n\n People with emphysema, takes 6 years to get to the point where it's reduced.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Never Use Ice, Only Immediately After Burn \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSwelling is nothing other than increased circulation\n\n Anytime you get an injury and you have swelling, do not run for the ice.\n\n If you do, you're gonna cause blood clotting, you're gonna cause the damaged, bruised tissue to remain in the area and that's why your athletes burn out in the late thirties.\n\n Because they've collected too much scar tissue and their injuries because their coach wanted them to play, so they put ice packs on them, so they can get out there and play again.\n\n Cuz as long as their is swelling there, the joints don't work as easily, so they're likely to fall out so they can't play well.\n\n So, they pack ice on their legs and knees, the arm the elbow, wherever it is.\n\n And then these people end up with scar tissue and not able to work past their 30s or 40s years old\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) No Vaccines, Bacteria Wont Make You Sick \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a friend whose mother didn't give him and his brother any vaccinations\n\n They were born in the late 40s, early 50s, and there was the worst sewage spill ever in the San Diego River and went out and went all the way down to to Point Loma Coastline and the surf was perfect.\n\n\r\nAnd my friend who had never had a vaccine, so nobody else would go out in the water.\n\n He was surfing perfect surf by himself for like two weeks.\n\n He knew he was fine.\n\n He knew he could.\n\n He knew he knew his immune system was good.\n\n His mother got put in jail for prescribing carrot juice as a remedy in the 30s.\n\n They put her in jail in New York for a day.\n\n So Derek for re For For her prescribing.\n\n For prescribing, yeah.\n\n Prescribing.\n\n But yeah.\n\n Coli story.\n\n Yeah.\n\n This guy swimming.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, let me give you an example.\n\n There was a movie out in 1986 I believe it was called Latino, and it starred Robert Beltron and one of my patients, Tony Plana, he was the third lead, and  it was about our interference in Nicaragua under the Reagan and Bush bodies and how we shouldn't have been there and what we were doing to Nicaragua cause it was a very democratic society.\n\n\r\nAnd he was gonna shoot a movie down there.\n\n Just before he left they gave him a legal page sheet that said, do not eat anything raw.\n\n If you an apple, you steam it.\n\n If you have water, you boil it.\n\n When you're in the swamp shooting, you don't touch your mouth or your face without washing your hands with a heavy detergent first.\n\n\r\nDon't drink any water near a swamp, unless it's recently boiled or distilled.\n\n They had this long list of everything not to do and Tony said, what do you think.\n\n I said, do absolutely the opposite what it says: you drink the swamp water, you eat your meat raw?\n\n You eat everything raw and you'll be okay.\n\n \r\nSo, they were down there shooting and within the first eight weeks everybody got deathly ill except Tony.\n\n Robert Beltran if you see the movie, if you can rent it, you see him lose 50 pounds from one scene to another.\n\n He got so ill that he lost 50 pounds.\n\n They shut the film down for six weeks he got so Ill.\n\n The only person who you didn't get sick was Tony Blunt.\n\n The entire set, everybody, the director, the actors, the gaffers, all of the cast and, and technicians, all of them, the entire crew got sick except him and he was drinking the swamp water, he was eating the raw meats, he was doing everything.\n\nthat a.\n\n Hadn't been on on that raw giant.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA normal person who wasn't on a raw diet, they would've got sick anyway.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey might have had a little case of it?\n\n But if they're eating only cooked and processed and boiled foods, they have no enzymes and vitamins to help them get well.\n\n So, here these people were sick and continuing to eat all this processed, cooked food and eating nothing raw.\n\n\r\nSo, they weren't getting any enzymes, no vitamins from their food.\n\n So, they just got sicker and sicker and sicker.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Only Domesticated Animals Get Cancer \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you know that no animals have cancer except domesticated animals\n\n No cancer out there because they eat dirt, they eat feces all the time?\n\n They even lick eachothers.\n\n They do all the time.\n\n \r\nAnd people are afraid of e coli,  e coli is completely responsible for the final digestion of protein.\n\n That is the protein that feeds the nervous system in brain.\n\n It's the finite particles that can get into the ultra small axons and ganglion interactions in the brain and nervous system.\n\n Without e coli, your brain and nervous system would not exist in the stage it is.\n\n You'd be a plant.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n25 years ago when I was in school, they taught that e coli was an essential part of your bacterial colony.\n\n \r\nNow they don't teach that anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n They're telling everybody to be afraid of it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Polio Vaccine \n \npolio\r\nvaccines\r\nflu\n \n \n \n### (30) Preserving Food \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor Y2k\n\n Yep.\n\n Everybody was panicking.\n\n I was a programmer, an autistic programmer, when I was autistic I was a programmer, so I knew that there was no danger in all of that.\n\n Bbut a lot of people were freaking out, so I was experimenting ways to preserve food.\n\n \r\nA friend of mine shot a deer and I bled it and skinned it and butchered it, and we put it in different containers with different things: olive oil, peanut oil, kefer, buttermilk, all kinds of things.\n\n Every one of 'em preserved very well.\n\n I've still got some of that meat that sits in those jars that's just as red and as pretty as when I put it in those jars and six years ago.\n\n \r\nSo, if you want to do that, you collect it.\n\n Honey's a very good substance to have a lot of on hand, and I keep about five gallons, I keep five gallons in my, cupboard.\n\n I don't keep the same one.\n\n I keep rotating eating them, but I always have five gallons in my cupboard, so I've got all that raw meat in jars and it's not even in the refrigerator.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNone of them worked better than the other.\n\n They all worked equally?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey all worked just as equally, as long as you don't open the lid?\n\n Once oxygen gets into it, the bacteria grow.\n\n\r\nThere was a scientist that, Vladimir Steffenson, who worked for the government, studied the Eskimo.\n\n He quoted a scientist who kept a piece of steak fresh for 10 years using buttermilk, covered it in a jar, 10 years that meat was fresh, so it could have been longer than that.\n\n They just opened it after 10 years.\n\n\r\nThey have, they have a tendency to mold.\n\n They get blue cheese mold on them.\n\n \r\nI've tried it everyway and I can't get butter to maintain, unless it's refrigerated.\n\n\r\nWell, cheese does not have to be refrigerated, just dehydrates so much.\n\n Cheese molds in the refrigerator.\n\n Cheese will not grow and not mold outside of the refrigerator, cheese depends upon low temperature molds.\n\n That's why they put cheese in cold storages and in caves to get those molds to grow in the cheese to make the cheese.\n\n You can't make cheese without a mold, without some kind of a fungus.\n\n\r\nIn Asia, a native taught me how to preserve meat fat.\n\n She took duck fat, chicken fat, beef fat, and she would just take it and just put it out in the sun for an hour and it creates a plastic ceiling, just not really plastic, but it's just like plastic and it seals the fat.\n\n\r\nSo, I shared something with her that was a year old and it was delicious under no refrigeration.\n\n But you just bake it in the sun for an hour and it puts a ceiling over the fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n And then what do you do in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, yeah, well she had it in a cooler, but you know, just out of the sun?\n\n There was no ice in it.\n\n\r\nI would put it in glass of course, a gallon glass jar.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Raw Fats Are Better \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAbsolutely\n\n Raw is better, definitely, because even your cooked fats are going to dry out and harden in the human body a little bit, but even in cooked they will stay mostly liquid in the human body, but vegetables do not, they turn into crystals.\n\n Every time you have a little sore and a crystal comes out a little yellow or amber looking little thing that comes off, you look at it under a microscope and you'll find crystals all throughout this little thing that comes out of your pore, that's vegetable oil, hardened vegetable oil that your body has thrown off.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Red Meat Activity Rings \n \n \n \n \n### (33) Science Of The Diet \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, the science behind the diet is that it works\n\n Like I said, in the beginning of the revision, everything that's in that book came about from experience.\n\n In other words, everything in there is empirical.\n\n Anything I say with science to back it up was following what actually happened because that's the way I started from back in 1973 when I realized that everybody contradicted everybody else about health.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo nothing was good for you and nothing was bad for you, and basically everything was confusion.\n\n I realized that I wasn't going to accept anything as truth, unless I saw it work and that's when I began observing and just taking notes, observing and taking notes.\n\n And I did not even start writing this book until 1993, cuz I wanted to have a lot of years of experience to see what really worked and what didn't.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (34) Skin Indigestible, Eating Bones, Kosher Bad, Pre Prepated Meats Are Cooked \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's not going to lodged in your throat\n\n When the animals get bones and people get bones lodged in their throat, it's always cooked bones.\n\n It's like the difference between unfired clay and fired clay.\n\n \r\nYou can chew bones, the Eskimos do it every day.\n\n They chew bones.\n\n\r\nMy teeth aren't good enough, after the chemo and radiation, all my teeth dangled and rotted all the bone around.\n\n I mean, I can rip meat up and I can eat hard stuff, but when it comes to the bone, I'm not gonna chance on breaking my bone and teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you had something to pulverize it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what I mean?\n\n Pulverize is good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGrate it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can grate it?\n\n I do that sometimes.\n\n It's a lot of work.\n\n**[Ron]**\n\r\nWell, I was kind rolling into everything you were talking about traveling.\n\n What you consume while travelling and how to shop.\n\n I didn't know about the fats, but it can't be cured fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf it's cured, like kosher?\n\n There's salt in it.\n\n Heavily salted.\n\n So nothing kosher.\n\n**[Ron]**\n\r\nWhen you're travelling, how do you know what they do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll you do is ask?\n\n**[Ron]**\n\r\nCorned beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorned beef is always cooked and processed?\n\n\r\nAny pre-prepared meats are always cooked, they're blanched they call it.\n\n \r\nHalf cooked, it's like half baked *laughs*.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Wheat Grass Acidic In Digestive Tractalkalin In Blood \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAbout wheatgrass\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, I did?\n\n In the first book.\n\n I say that wheatgrass juice, unlike any other vegetable that is green and produces chlorophyl, is acidic in the blood and alkaline in the intestines.\n\n And you want just the opposite of that.\n\n You want acidity in the digestive tract and alkalinity in the blood.\n\n\r\nYour blood always should be on the acid side, but we have so many toxins in our body that the blood has a tendency to get over acidic.\n\n That's why I suggest vegetable juices throughout the day to help balance that so nobody gets too irritable or too dry or whichever comes first, the dryness or the irritability.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Where To Bu Yfresh Coconuts \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYou just return them; they'll take them back\n\n I return everything.\n\n I don't keep anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf I get a bad coconut, it goes back to the store.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBetter do what she does.\n\n She throws them up in the air and smashes them on the ground.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat I do is I put em in an old towel and take a hammer and then I take a wide screwdriver, get in there and just pop it the meat.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nI found a good way to do it quickly.\n\n I've got a wooden board, a really hard board and a serrated knife and I slice it thinly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI found out an even better way.\n\n You take the oyster knife like I say, and pull out the coconut, then you just chop it into large chunks and you put it in a food processor like a Cuisinart, and you grate it, put it into gratings.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut before you do that, once you take your pieces, your chunks, you put 'em in a jar, like a quart jar or larger, half gallon or gallon jars.\n\n You fill your sink with hot water, you put it in there, you put a little water in there, and you get the pieces of meat wet, and then you let us sit.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou've got no level of water in the jar, you've just got your wet coconut in an empty jar, floating in this warm, it heats the coconut.\n\n You get almost 1/3 more coconut cream.\n\n I had three little coconuts this big and I got (4x) 8z jars of the coconut cream by doing that.\n\n \r\n\r\nFour eight-ounce jars from three little bitty coconuts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nExplain that again one more time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n You take the coconut; I don't drink the water in it anymore cause it causes bloating.\n\n I was wondering why all these Asians don't drink this coconut water.\n\n They just break it and throw it away and I was having four of those a day and after a month I started getting ankle and feet swelling and leg swelling.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that's why they don't, cause it causes swelling.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou used to tell me to drink the coconut water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n But you were just drinking one a day, there wasn't much.\n\n But it takes a lot more time to drain the water out.\n\n Takes a lot of time in the process of making coconut cream.\n\n So, what I do is now I just skip that and I just go out there and I take it on a big rock out in my backyard, slam it on there and break it under pieces, then take my curved end oyster knife, pries it very quickly out of the coconut shell.\n\n Then I slice it into chunks, no chunks bigger than that, that square, of course, it's that thick.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThen I put those into a gallon jar.\n\n If I'm doing just a few of them, I'll put it in a quart jar.\n\n But if I'm doing a lot of them and I want to make it for weeks at a time, like 5 -6 weeks, I may be doing 10 coconuts.\n\n So I'll put two gallon jars of this coconut meat.\n\n I let it sit in the sink full of hot water.\n\n Not hot enough to burn my hand, but hot enough and it takes about 15 minutes to heat that coconut.\n\n And I'll go do something else during that time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat is the temperature of the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nProbably 105° - 106°, somewhere around there?\n\n And then I come back and everything's warm inside, the heat has caused all of that oil and the meat to become warm and soft.\n\n I get it a little wet before I put it in the jar, I forgot to say that.\n\n I wet it with my gerolsteiner cause I don't buy any other water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou could wet it with the coconut water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, you could wet it with the coconut water, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nTablespoon per coconut.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nTablespoon of what?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWater?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I just, I have a bowl there and I just dip it all in there and put it in the jar.\n\n \r\n\r\nListen to me.\n\n I have water in a bowl and I take the pieces and I dip them in the water and put 'em into the jar, then I immerse it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWarm water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, then after the coconut is warm, I put it in the food processor, my Cuisinart, and it gets grated, so it's grated coconut.\n\n Then I juice that and it gets so much more juice, there's no chance of cracking the juicer at all, and there's no strain on it.\n\n It moves through faster.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I get 1/3 more coconut cream.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (37) Whey Protein and How Much Sex Aajonus Has \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, whey is good to get rid of fibromyalgia, it helps break down urea in the body\n\n It contains a lot of lactic acids, so if you have sore joints, if you're an athlete, you get sore long, bruised long.\n\n The whey, that's the liquid if you take milk and it separates to curds and way, it's the yellow stuff that's left.\n\n \r\n\r\nDried whey, it's a big seller, pumps up muscles.\n\n It inflates them, then you'll look like Arnold Schwarzenegger does today.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHe looks very flat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh yeah.\n\n Did you see his skin in that last bathing suit shot.\n\n His skin looks like an old, tired elephant all the way down?\n\n I'm older than he is, and I don't have any of that.\n\n And I don't exercise, he still exercising.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow do you do it.\n\n How do you keep muscles on your arm if you don't exercise?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI eat properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut it doesn't put muscle on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, it does.\n\n It does if you've been on the diet as long as I have.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* he said he had a big sex drive; you don't see his girlfriend.\n\n What does he do with all of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI have three girlfriends in Thailand, that's the only time I have sex?\n\n 2 - 3 months a year.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo, not at the same time.\n\n That's too much work.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nFor the whey, does it have to be refrigerated or can it be out and should it be out to be fermented.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends on, when you leave it out, it gets more vinegarette and sometimes it's harder to drink, it's a little bit more acidic?\n\n So, it's up to you how you like it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you add honey to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you add honey to it, it might rush into your system a little too quickly?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n And how much per day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends upon the person and the amount of soreness and aching?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut when he talked about pickles, do you recommend that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's one way to pickle instead of vinegar?\n\n I prefer that to vinegar for pickling, but it just doesn't taste the same.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSeasickness.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAirsickness, Seasickness.\n\n The best way to do it, get something like a piece of wood and put it under a band and hold it there.\n\n For some reason, that stops it.\n\n \r\n\r\nCouple of years ago, I had a Vietnamese girlfriend and we were flying for a vacation and it was her first time on a plane, and she was vomiting as soon as the plane left the field, so I just took both of her wrists and I put my finger across like this on both of her wrists, instantly the nausea stopped, instantly just like that.\n\n It was only a 45-minute flight, so I held her wrists the whole time and that took care of her \r\n\r\nNo, I didn't join the Mile High Club.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhere did you learn this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I was on a boat and seasick as hell?\n\n A friend of mine had a small boat, and we went out in off the coast to go fishing for some swordfish.\n\n And I don't do well on the ocean on small boats, all of that makes me terribly ill.\n\n So, he had these little wristbands that had a little wooden band across it and attached on, nausea stopped like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIt hits all your acupuncture points as they cross it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd I don't know how it works and why it works.\n\n It just works.\n\n It's like everything else in my book.\n\n I can give you bullshit reasons from science why it works, but it works.\n\n .\n \n \n \n"

meat.\n\n I don't have a problem.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I started eating that in 1993 - 1996 and they said it's a 10 - 15-year incubation period.\n\n Y \r\n\r\nou have to eat the brain and nervous system to have that kind of toxicity from mad cow, so you eat the muscle meat and you'll be pretty assured of being okay.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Clinic, Volcanoes In Phillipines \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhat are you going to do with your clinic\n\n You talk about this clinic several times?\n\n What are they going to do there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI will mainly have locals, at least 50% of the clientele will be local that don't pay, that just work part of the land in exchange for my help?\n\n \r\nAnd we will grow all the foods, all herbs, everything that the people will use to get well.\n\n  \r\nSo, let's say people have cancer and they wanna go to someplace other than Hippocrates that starves them to death.\n\n They'll be able to go to a place where they can get nourished and get stronger and healthier.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, you will raise the cow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEverything?\n\n I've already made a deal with the government in Palawan Island.\n\n They have a dairy experimental farm and it's going under because Filipinos aren't used to milk, so I'm buying their cows and their milking machine and there's the portable ones attach on it, hook up.\n\n It isn't like a big tank or anything.\n\n  \r\nSo, I'm getting three cows that are imported from New Zealand and I'll start with that.\n\n I'm putting it all together, hopefully in July or August, one of the other, l'll put it all together and have everything finalized.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThe island that you found that had the indigenous people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no, no?\n\n \r\nThat was almost 2000 miles away.\n\n Oh.\n\n The reason I chose Palawan Island because all the other islands are in the volcano district.\n\n You've got the Ring of Fire, it goes all the way from Japan, all the way down to the the lowest island, South Island of the Philippines.\n\n \r\nThere are 47 volcanoes in the Philippines.\n\n And they're like this.\n\n If you look at the map, you've got Manila with the big island, Luong here and then you've got all these other bigger islands spread all the way down till you get to Menal, the biggest island.\n\n And then over here you've got Palawan Island, which is a very long island.\n\n \r\nNow all of these islands are in that big crevice that's 20 times the size of the Grand Canyon and all these volcanoes underneath it.\n\n So, if that goes off, Japan, all of that's going under.\n\n But Palawan is an island that's on the shallowest sea floor of anywhere, only that island.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWon't you get like tidal waves from that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, because I'll be 1900 feet up in the mountains, they're selling me the mountain top?\n\n That's why I'm up there.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Work Schedule Philipines Land \n \nhealth centre\r\naajonus\r\nthailand\r\naajonus plans\r\nmalaria\r\nhoney\r\nlime\n \n \n \n### (4) Aids, Swine Flue, Vaccines \n \n**[2006],[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI think you had a radio interview and as part of the interview you'd talked- \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nAbout the radio interview on swine flu\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYes.\n\n And as part of that interview, I think you one of the topics was aids and I think you said the development of AIDS took place at UCLA.\n\n \r\n\r\nI got from the article that you were saying that the only way that you could get aids was by injection or vaccination.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect or blood.\n\n Or a transfusion contaminated blood.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you don't really, it's not really a sexually transmitted disease.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nImpossible?\n\n In my laboratory experiments, I've only found, let's say two bodies of congested so-called virus of AIDS.\n\n Virus is not contagious in the first place.\n\n You have to have a chemical injected in you, just like swine flu.\n\n There's no way for you to get swine flu, impossible.\n\n Swine flu means that you have pig tissue inside of your body that your body is using a solvent, not a bacteria, not a parasite, not a fungus to break that tissue down.\n\n Now, even if you had pig tissue in you from inhaling pig tissue, let's say you worked on a pig farm and it was a toxic pig farm where the pigs had a lot of dandruff and you inhaled it regularly, you would end up with a flu to break down the swine tissue, still is not the same as the swine flu.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe swine who makes a solvent to dissolve its own tissue is different from ours.\n\n So, it's still not the same flu that a pig would get to clean its own tissue.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, you cannot get AIDS unless it's injected.\n\n And if you read Horowitz's stuff, you see they put it in the Hepatitis B vaccine to give it to people in the states.\n\n They put it in the smallpox vaccine in Africa, 125 million donated by the US government and the British government.\n\n Why.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey took over 27 countries in Africa?\n\n How did they do that.\n\n They went in and said, oh, you've got a disease?\n\n We gave you these free- ur government's not gonna give freeway anything, unless there's something attached to it.\n\n So, the British and the American government gave 125 million shots of vaccine to Africa for free and paid for them to be injected into the Africans.\n\n \r\n\r\nPaid for all the doctors and nurses to do that.\n\n Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n It was estimated about 2 billion to do.\n\n What did they get.\n\n They went into the country and said, Oh, you've got an AIDS problem?\n\n We have drugs and they pulled AZT out of the vaults.\n\n AZT is the chemo they gave me.\n\n AZT was found a year after it was given to me to be so toxic for humans, they were no longer given to humans, so they put it in the vaults.\n\n When the AIDS came out, they said, AZT is good for aids.\n\n No tests, no nothing.\n\n They just wanted to pull it out of the vault to kill everybody who had aids.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they took the, the AZT also over to Africa and they killed everybody that they could.\n\n And so, what happened was they went to government and said, \"Oh, we'll give you this medical help, we'll give you this chemotherapy, we'll treat your people\", killed them, put 'em in debt.\n\n Debt that they could never repay.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, now the World Bank runs for the British and American governments runs those 27 countries and if you read a book called, \"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\", then you'll understand that's what they do, the governments do.\n\n It's a way of waging war and take over resources without having to really send people in to fight, you poison 'em to death.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the name of that book again, confessions of what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nConfessions of A Financial Hitman?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you just say one more time and exactly what is it they put in the vaccine.\n\n Likes Aids, it's not some sort of virus?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, what they did was, according to Strecker, who found it was created at UCLA in 1961 and 1962, they claimed that they had produced it from the lymphomic virus of the sheep and the waste products and the leukemic virus of a bovine, cow \r\n\r\nSo, they took those two toxic substances, put them together, and then put it in the hepatitis and the small pox vaccine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, virus isn't a bacteria or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, it's not alive, it's a chemical?\n\n And the chemicals that they put in there allowed the chemicals to infiltrate the RNA and DNA chains and damage them.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's a biochemical electromagnetic science that the military is very keen on.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, that's what aids is.\n\n Destruction of RNA, DNA?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nChains, yes?\n\n Breaks down the system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI've talked to a shaman in Africa, and he said that they, they're people would make these marks on their arm as if they had vaccination, so they would avoid it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nPoisoning.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNot poisoning, but they actually even accessed some kind of a soul DNA in a way that actually altered their capacity for consciousness.\n\n He was not gonna let his people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRight.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, Vietnam, when they started vaccinating the children, the adults, the ones who were like shamans and there were a lot of shamans in South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the elders would come out and cut their arm off up the shoulder because they knew the poison was gonna go back and do damage in the body.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey preferred to cut the arm off, they could see what was going to happen.\n\n Even better to cut the arm off, then to let that poison circulate to the system.\n\n And then, the American medical profession, these barbarians.\n\n Instead of the medical provision being the barbarians for injecting these poisons, the grandparents became the savages for cutting off the arm.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut they could see what, of course, the Americans are not able to see at all.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (5) Allergie, Low Mucus \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFamily member has been on the diet for a while and they have severe allergy to dust mites\n\n What do you recommend.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a low mucus?\n\n Like I said, if you look at mucus under a microscope, it's like a bunch of s like a bunch of material put together, layers of material.\n\n\r\nIf the fibers are tight, nothing's going to get through and it can be as much 20 layers thick when you're dumping mucus or it could be as small as three layers thick.\n\n If the fibers are open, if you don't have enough protein fibers.\n\n All of those dust and the mites will just get right through that mesh and right in irritate the mucus membrane.\n\n\r\nAnd that's an issue, it's a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, they need to build mucus?\n\n Milkshakes are your best.\n\n Milk and eggs together with little honey, extra cream.\n\n Helps build mucus fast.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Big Gut, Aajonus Weight \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you're asking me, I say, no, you don't want to get rid of it\n\n I kept mine for 23 years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nFlat now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNow, yes.\n\n But for 23 years I kept it, it's like a baby.\n\n A baby's not gonna grow and get healthy fast unless it has that gut.\n\n You notice that all babies who have no gut, their bones grow thin and feeble.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou want a baby to be fat, you have to be fat cause you're on a new diet.\n\n You're growing yourself anew, you have to consider yourself a baby.\n\n So, you need all those extra nutrients to be able to distribute them.\n\n If you run into a detox, what's gonna happen if you don't have the excess nutrients.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou're gonna fall and crash hard?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThis is the only place the fat is, right here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's good.\n\n But it goes from there to the rest of your body if you just keep eating.\n\n And I say that in my books.\n\n Get fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThank you very much, Aajonus *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou know I'm still fat 18.\n\n Last night I was 18.\n\n7% body fat.\n\n Athletes who are my size are like 9% - 12% body fat.\n\n But when the fat molecules are very tiny, like when they're raw, they don't take up much space.\n\n But when you cook a fat, it swells anywhere from 5 - 50 times its normal size.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, you have all this bloating from all this old fat, and I've been on this diet eating all raw foods and no cooked fats since 1972, February of 1972.\n\n So, I don't have any of those toxic fats in my body anymore.\n\n All of the molecules of fat are small so I can stay and still be fat.\n\n But I wish I had had more fat on me when this happened cuz I would've gotten to this quicker and easier cuz my body got poisoned.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDid you lose muscle mass too.\n\n You look like you lost muscle mass?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI lost everywhere.\n\n I lost muscle and fat.\n\n So, I'm down to like a 29-inch waist, which I haven't has since I was 16.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (7) Butter and Cilantro For Mecrury \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can take it all day long and it's not gonna change the color of your hair\n\n You have to give rid of the aluminum first.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI read somewhere that you said to do like a tablespoon of cilantro juice with a tablespoon of butter or something every two hours to get rid of mercury.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll help?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould that help him to do something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, depends?\n\n If it's just mercury, I'd have to look in his eyes to see what kind of metals are coming outta his skin.\n\n He could have a fungus involved with it.\n\n He could have that tetracycline or something like that because that looks like it's an antibiotic irritated along with the metals.\n\n So, he is got a fungus in the skull too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the only time it ever went away was when we used to have a swimming pool and it was chlorine, it was years ago.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, killed the fungus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt would go away in the summer when he was in a pool all the time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut you can put vinegar on it, it will help destroy it too.\n\n But to keep your head strong, to get it to be able to withstand that kind of toxicity, the bone marrow would be good.\n\n\r\nSo, one day you could put vinegar, diluted vinegar by 50%, rub it in into the scalp, and then just let it sit for a day, and then the next day, rinse it out and then put bone marrow in and let that sit for a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nPut on the bone marrow even if it's old.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven if it's old, it works wonderfully?\n\n Go around stinking\r\nZinc can create some hair coloring loss, but it doesn't cause.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Clay To Absorb Toxins, Types Of Clay \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n17 or something, or 1890 something\n\n I forgot the dates completely, but I remember the story.\n\n He advertised that he's gonna drink a 1/2 cup of arsenic and they publicized it.\n\n He made a ton of money and only on his deathbed did he give the secret away cause he pulled the stunt several times.\n\n \r\nHe drank a half a cup of clay an hour before he drank- or 40 minutes, something like that before he drank the arsenic, so the clay absorbed it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat kind of clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey didn't say, I like to stay away from any clay that's from molten lava because you've got a lot of molten metals?\n\n\r\nYour minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium or alkanalizing ones, when they reach volcanic temperatures, they go off into a gas, so they're no longer part of that rock.\n\n And when the algae in water starts eating- algae and mossy rock, and all plants eat rock.\n\n So, when the water mixes in the plants, whether it's algae, whatever, breaks those down into a clay, it's still a toxic laden clay.\n\n\r\nIt's a clay that I won't eat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich one would you eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, Terramin clay is the best?\n\n It's from an old aqua bead.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Collodial Silver \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, what's the hoax with the colloidal silver\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nColloidal silver are minerals, plants eat minerals, we don't?\n\n \r\nIf we eat metallic minerals, what's gonna happen.\n\n\r\nIt's gonna become free radicals in the body, they do a lot of damage?\n\n Of course, you'll feel better because you're poisoning the blood so badly, it's not gonna detox anything old.\n\n It's just gonna handle that toxicity in the blood, that's how medication works.\n\n You poison the blood and the intestinal tract, so all the body does concentrate on those two systems, the blood and the intestinal tract.\n\n\r\nAll of your symptoms go away.\n\n All of your other symptoms go away, so you think you're well but you're not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's just pushed deeper.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPushed deeper, and you're causing more toxicity because now you're not gonna be able to digest properly, cuz you've destroyed the bacteria in intestines?\n\n 90% of all functions of the body happen with bacteria.\n\n\r\n90% of all functions in the body are by bacteria.\n\n You destroy them when you take an antibiotic, you're destroying a myriad of bacteria all over the body: in the blood and the lymph, and the intestinal tract and the heart, brain, everywhere.\n\n Mass contamination.\n\n \r\nSo what happens.\n\n You don't assimilate your nutrients, you don't heal properly, you scar and you get many more poisons deep into the tissue?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Cows Vs Goats \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're overweight, I prefer goat milk\n\n If you have a sugar problem or diabetes, prefer goat milk.\n\n\r\nBut if you are not any of those four things, then cows milk is better.\n\n \r\nHave you ever seen a calm goat.\n\n\r\nIt doesn't happen?\n\n So, their milk has adrenaline precursors in it, so you can't get fat on goat's milk.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Dairy \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd the reasoning is\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the reasoning is that if you were in the wild, you wouldn't really have a cow to milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, yeah.\n\n There are many nomads that would capture a lactating animal and milk them?\n\n That's how they started doing it in the first place, especially the Norwegians.\n\n\r\nYou know, they didn't wanna like live like the Eskimos and have to eat icicles all the time, the meat with icicles.\n\n Cause when you're fishing in a portal in the in, you've got ice foot and a half thick.\n\n By the time your fish comes out of there in your mouth, it's a popsicle already.\n\n\r\nSo, the Norwegians started importing cows and buffalo, buffalos had larger utters, into the Norwegian regions and started milking them.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd the Mongolians.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMongolians did, Indians in India, heavy dairy country?\n\n\r\nThey're vegetarians, but they're dairy eaters.\n\n Our mouth is predominantly bacteria.\n\n We have more bacteria than any other animal on the planet, including dogs and cats.\n\n Dogs and cats have 16 - 118 bacteria parts per million of saliva.\n\n We have 2300 - 2600 bacteria per million parts.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNever want to kiss anybody anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're just giving them some good bacteria.\n\n So, we infiltrate our food with bacteria first.\n\n The hydrochloric acid just breaks apart larger food particles, so the bacteria can get in and eat and digest them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI guess one of the arguments that I've heard is, you know, well, no other species drink milk or some species.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHave you ever offered any other animal milk.\n\n I've given it to horses?\n\n I've even milked a  cow given it its own milk, and they'll drink gallon, gallon and a half in one sitting.\n\n Every animal that I've ever offered, herbivore or whatever, has all consumed milk.\n\n It's just that how many females are gonna let 'em milk them.\n\n\r\nHave you seen there's pictures on the internet where they have the tiger nursing monkey babies and animal baby?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBabies, but adults, that's what I was wondering about?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll animals, every animal, even squirrels drink milk and eat cheese.\n\n I feed mine all the time.\n\n  \r\nEating butter and getting the butter into your skin and sunshine is the best vitamin D source.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Dandelion Citric Acid \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're after that particular effect of that particular herb\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike dandelion might be your liver?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, dandelion is very high in vitamin C, so it helps the citric acid cycle of utilizing fats fuel, so it could give you more energy?\n\n\r\nThere's different things that you can do with dandelion.\n\n Some people take it to clean the liver and the blood.\n\n I can't say necessarily does that, but the vitamin C is very good for oxidizing fats to be able to use as fuel for energy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe should be able to get everything we need without all those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I'm saying they're all good if you can get them organic, and juice them and fresh?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe have clover in our yard, fresh, organic clover grass.\n\n We wondering if we could juice it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOut of your yard.\n\n Doesn't matter, you've got chemtrails galore and you had all those fires that sent you into a tizzy and a lot of people into a tizzy?\n\n So, all those burned, um, home products that burned up in the homes, which were highly toxic, radioactive.\n\n\r\nEverything's in the soil.\n\n Going on for years now, that'll go on for 10 years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's all coming off my roof.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Should hose that and get it all down right away.\n\n You're breathing that a little at a time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow do you know then that you get from somebody who doesn't have the same issue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, everywhere's toxic now?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot unless you follow up and say, give me the name of the producer and then you call the distributor.\n\n Then the distributor will give you the producer's name and then you go through these channels, I've done it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs anywhere not toxic now.\n\n Everywhere's got toxins the air now?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's true, but I wouldn't trust anything around here.\n\n In fact, I stopped buying avocados from down here for the last year since that fire.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhere did you get them from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n⁠The lower part of Fresno Santa and Santa Maria area?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, that goes for the organic farmers that are local here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean, that's what we're all eating.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey're also being watered with the fluoride water too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Depleted Soils \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf our soil is depleted, then what's the best way to get minerals in our diet\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVegetarians have come up with this concept, because they can't be healthy as vegetarians, so they're making excuses?\n\n There is no soil that's depleted, unless peanuts or legumes are grown in the soil like soy.\n\n Those grounds are completely depleted, but not in minerals, but of proteins and microbes.\n\n Never get depleted in minerals, it's impossible.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWasn't that the whole idea of that when the Nile with flood and everything, and it would have such plentiful crops as a result of all the minerals that came.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the algae breaks down rock, provides all those minerals?\n\n\r\nSo, when the algae would flow over there, they would have all these digested minerals and they would break down into the soil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n That makes sense, but we don't have that in the places where there are farmers farming land.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's about getting microorganisms in the ground to break down the minerals to release them.\n\n\r\nIt's not about putting minerals into the ground, it's already there.\n\n It's you have poisons in the ground that are preventing the fractionation of those to be absorbed by the plants, that's the issue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMicroorganisms in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIn our body?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh.\n\n Well, if you're drinking vegetable juice, you're already doing, you're already doing it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoing what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProviding many minerals and enzymes that you wouldn't normally get and vitamins?\n\n We're not herbivores.\n\n We take vegetables and we juice them, so we have this concentrated mineral solution with lots of vitamins and enzymes.\n\n Those are your supplements.\n\n Taking a cup of vegetable juice a day, even if the soil so-called depleted is 10 times the amount that you would ever get in good soil.\n\n\r\nThat's why vegetable juice is part of the diet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Dry Scalp, Grey Gair From Aluminum \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYours is not from the normal dryness, yours is from Mercury in your brain and aluminum\n\n And that's until your body stops throwing it off, or you can handle it correctly out of the skin without breaking out.\n\n See, normally the body will build those toxins into the hair follicles and build it into hair.\n\n Yours is just coming out the skin.\n\n So you have good hair, but you don't have good skin.\n\n\r\nSo, most people will lose their hair because it builds into the follicles, damages the follicle.\n\n Yours is coming right outta your scalp, right outta your skin.\n\n And that's for every vaccine that you've ever had that much to went to your brain.\n\n \r\nWhat you can do is put some bone marrow, rub oily bone marrow at room temperature, rub that into your scalp and see if that will strengthen the RNA and DNA, so you can lose hair instead of losing your scalp.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs* oh boy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour choice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWill the hair grow back after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot very often?\n\n You see with chemotherapy, this hasn't grown back since I was 22 years old.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs there, is there any way to get the mercury out without it all coming out his head like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Yours is mostly aluminum and it turns it grey.\n\n\r\nDestroys benzoic acid properties of the follicles.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe hasn't had that many vaccines, but I had a lot of mercury from teeth and pesticides, all kinds of, so do you think from breastfeeding him when he was a baby, that's why.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, during gestation and breastfeeding?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd my mother always cooked in aluminum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlmost all gray hair as a result of high aluminum.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, basically the diet just eventually takes care of this stuff.\n\n There's nothing special.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n40 years to get rid of the toxins?\n\n I still have 14 years to go.\n\n  I'm 62 years old than I'm still alive.\n\n\r\nI was supposed to die 42 years ago.\n\n Healthier than I ever was as a child.\n\n This is nothing compared to what I suffered as a child.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf she stayed on the diet for 40 years, will her hair grow back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, even her hair is coming back?\n\n My hair is getting darker.\n\n\r\nIn mine, I get gray patches, a year ago this was dark.\n\n This is the only thing that doesn't go back and forth.\n\n Used to have a gray patch back here for six years that went away.\n\n So it comes and goes.\n\n As I dump a lot of aluminum out of my brain, then my hair goes gray.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, somebody that's healthy and they have a dark head of hair, which is not dyed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMeans they're not discarding aluminum out the hair.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nIt doesn't mean they don't have it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight?\n\n Doesn't mean they don't have it.\n\n It means you're not discarding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think somebody told me that gray hair is because of the lack of a nutrient.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey used to say it was a lack of para amino benzoic acid, B vitamin that regulates pigmentation.\n\n\r\nBut aluminum destroys it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Eat In Middle Of Night \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I've been on a diet about 14 months now.\n\n I've just been feeling really bad the last month.\n\n I've had a bronchial infection that won't go away and I'm so stiff and sore that it took me about 10 minutes to get out of bed in the morning cuz I can't straighten my legs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre you waking during the night and eating or are you spending your whole 8 hours asleep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUsually asleep?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou gotta wake up and eat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAt your size, you're probably losing 4 - 6 tablespoons of red blood cells?\n\n As soon as 5 hours passes, your blood has not enough protein to feed the red blood cells.\n\n\r\nSo, the red blood cells start eating other red blood cells for the protein, become cannibalistic.\n\n Fasting is a terrible thing cause you're eating up your red blood cells.\n\n \r\nWhat happens is you wake up with anemia, everybody's waking with anemia, so they go for a drug: caffeine, nicotine, something like that, pump them up, give them energy.\n\n A hundred years ago you had to be rich to afford coffee and nicotine, unless you're growing it.\n\n Now people live on it.\n\n Pardon.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut they didn't wake up every couple of hours and eat either, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they weren't as toxic as we are, but they did?\n\n They woke up during the night, absolutely.\n\n Almost everybody that I knew and have interviewed always woke during the night sometime and would have something to nibble on cause they wake up cuz they were hungry.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhen I get up to pee at night, I always pop an egg.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Pop an egg.\n\n There you go, perfect.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I'm really stiff all day too.\n\n It's like anytime I sit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust remember if you get anemic in the night, you're gonna have a hard time getting going in the morning cuz your body's trying to deal with the anemia.\n\n\r\nAll of this nutrients are gonna go be going to the bone marrow and your joints.\n\n And if you got toxic bone marrow and toxic joints, because let's say you have Crohn's or some leaky gut problem, you're gonna have the exact symptoms you have.\n\n \r\nSo, it sounds like you not only have Crohn's, you cause anemia every day.\n\n\r\nSo, you need to suck eggs all day long.\n\n Probably have 22 a day and wake during the night to have your protein during the night.\n\n \r\nNow, if you're a person who wakes after five hours and eats and can't go back to sleep, cuz you have too much energy, then  set your alarm for three hours, and then you sleep five hours.\n\n\r\nLet me tell you, if you're causing anemia every day, that's gonna go on for ages 6 - 7 years.\n\n So, you need to take care of your basic things, don't get anemic.\n\n Take care of that and these detoxes usually don't last over a year and a half.\n\n Normally, they last about anywhere from 2 - 6 weeks and then they pass on.\n\n Unless you've got a real serious bronchial problem, toxicity, but I've seen them last up to a year and a half.\n\n That's the worst case scenario.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've had lung infections for many years before the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd you took antibiotics for it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I did take colloidal silver.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPoison yourself with minerals.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Farmed Fishoysters, What Fish To Eat \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I'd like people to get fat to have the buffering to protect them from the poisons in the body\n\n \r\nDo you have a question, Lorraine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I told you I'm gonna go over it Italy soon.\n\n I've seen a lot of squid and octopus there.\n\n Is it okay to eat that stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're farmed?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're farmed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFarmed oysters and clams, all they can do is put a fence out in the ocean  and the government tells them that they have to call it farmed, but they're still eating whats out in the ocean.\n\n\r\nSometimes what they'll do is they'll do is, you've got a baby clam attached to another clam and they won't grow till they're full size, unless they're broken off and transplanted.\n\n So, that's what they do in these farms.\n\n They're still getting fed just by the ocean.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, cod and like red snapper.\n\n\r\nAre those okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThose are ocean?\n\n Tuna, swordfish, I mostly eat swordfish.\n\n When I'm in the Philippines, I mostly eat tuna.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can't get salmon anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I don't like salmon too much because it's too much from lakes and they've set a lot of genetically modified salmon loose and they're crossbreeding now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, we're eating GMO salmon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, GMO salmon?\n\n So, I don't touch salmon anymore.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow about salmon from from Tasmania.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTasmania be okay?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBecause Newport Beach, they fly it in every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTasmania's an island off of Australia.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it says wild.\n\n Isn't that okay if it says wild.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because now they let they've let the salmon, the genetically modified salmon breed with the wild salmon?\n\n They're only talking about Santa.\n\n Yeah.\n\n\r\nAnything that's from the ocean that isn't salmon.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about Alaska.\n\n Salmon from Alaska?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't make any difference.\n\n That's where they mainly let them loose.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Frozen Meat & Butter \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen I did experiments with animals and fed them frozen meats, they all got skin disorders within six weeks\n\n I had two groups.\n\n The animals that I fed the same meat that wasn't frozen, had no disorders.\n\n I didn't feed them water, anything.\n\n They only ate the meat for that 6 - 10 week period.\n\n \r\nThen all of the animals who got the skin disorder, one even got scabies.\n\n I took those animals and I split them in half and fed them half raw butter and half frozen butter.\n\n The same butter, some of it frozen, some of it unfrozen.\n\n The animals that I gave the frozen butter to took five times longer to heal their skin disorder.\n\n\r\nSo, freezing does affect it.\n\n I don't care what Sally Fallon or anybody else says, they have never done the experiments I have.\n\n So don't freeze anything.\n\n \r\nWell, you can just freeze fruits, nothing harms fruits.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCheese.\n\n You don't wanna freeze cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you get arctic fish, that's okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEverything comes down frozen from the boats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAs long as it's an arctic fish.\n\n\r\nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI do?\n\n I just have a note for that because you said the dog had psoriasis.\n\n I've been feeding it just the stuff from the supermarket, like natural Tyson or whatever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt could be frozen.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey freeze it.\n\n It looks like it's fresh, but it's probably frozen now that you said that.\n\n\r\nIs that why he's got the skin problems.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd should you take the skin off.\n\n \r\nThey shouldn't have the skin?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n And you can't give them frozen meats.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nPreviously frozen, but they'll say fresh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, there are others that don't say that.\n\n They say fresh.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Grass Is Acidic, Only 5% Of Juice Certain Herbs \n \n**[2009],[Daniel]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou've previously said grasses are acidic, once you told me if I want any\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're acidic to the blood, they're alkanizing in the intestines.\n\n The exact opposite of what you want.\n\n**[Daniel]**\n\r\nBut you said if I wanted to take some wild groom grass, that's not wheat grass.\n\n\r\nEspecially for the mineral content and salt content for that, I could put a couple ounces into the milk.\n\n Besides those grasses, is there a reason you don't use kale or dandelion, spinach in your juices.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I said you can use those, but never more than 5% of the juice because they will be very detoxifying or chemically changing to the body?\n\n\r\nSo, any kind of a herb that is that strong.\n\n You need to keep it at a low ratio, no more than 5%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you mean chemical changing.\n\n What does it change?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can change your blood, it can change your intestines, it can change the chemistry of everything?\n\n All of a sudden you find yourself way outta whack.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGet kidney stones or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGet all kinds, I've seen all kinds of issues, endless issues?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when should you use those.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnytime you want to use it?\n\n It doesn't matter, as long as it's never more than 5% of your juice.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Herbivores, Vegetarians, Vegetalbe Oils \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVersus eating a lot of salads\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can't digest it.\n\n Herbivore has 2.\n\n5 times more digestive tract than we do, they have 60,000 more digestive enzymes for breaking down the cellulose molecule to get the fat and protein, takes 48 hours or more for food to pass through their systems with 60% - 80% of it digested, not even all of it digested.\n\n\r\n2% in ours, that's it.\n\n 2% in 24 hours.\n\n It over alkalizes the intestines and neutralizes all of that hydrochloric acid that you have in the stomach and the small intestines to break down your food particles to smaller amounts so bacteria can eat them.\n\n Our bacteria is the acidic nature.\n\n The fluids, the alkaline fluids from whole vegetables will neutralize those, so you stop digesting.\n\n \r\nI'm saying don't eat whole vegetables.\n\n I'm saying drink the vegetable juice cuz you can get all the minerals, vitamins, and the enzymes from the vegetation, that we can handle.\n\n That's the 2%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIn nature you wouldn't have a juicer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, do like the dogs, cats, and the gorillas.\n\n They chew it and spit out the fiber.\n\n They're juicing in their mouth.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that what you do in Thailand or do you get juice in Thailand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can get juice in Thailand?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAnd for the salad, I think you said don't have it with oil or vinegar or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it coats it?\n\n It comes and I said if you're going to eat vegetation, you eat a salad and you eat it last thing in the day.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nBut you don't put any olive oil on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can make a cheese sauce, something like that?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n But why don't you want oil on it or vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt coats the vegetation?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat if you just have vinegar on it.\n\n Is that okay?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's okay?\n\n You'll start fermenting it.\n\n It'll digest a little bit better with that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt won't feel good on your stomach if you put oil on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends upon the person, some people can handle it?\n\n Italians and Greeks are used to it.\n\n But that's centuries.\n\n \r\nYou can't digest that cellulose.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nBut you say you eat cooked food, you have to have the raw salad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet's say you eat cooked meat, you better have a raw salad with it, or else it's not gonna move, it'll putrefy?\n\n\r\nDo you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have trouble running?\n\n I couldn't get my body moving and I'm just trying to start.\n\n I'm sleeping a lot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, I can see your skin.\n\n You don't have any good animal fats in your body.\n\n You have a lot of grain, acetates that are made from grains.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been doing 20 years of vegetarian diet?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere you go.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much can I jump in to this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPeople jump into it wholeheartedly?\n\n \r\nJust remember this, 50% of my cancer clients are long-term vegetarians and vegetable oils cause all the hardening of the arteries in the heart because they crystallize, we can't digest them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's not like arthritis and stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you don't have any lubrication in your body, good fats?\n\n You don't have any good animal fats in your body.\n\n \r\nButter, cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs the honey really essential.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it isn't essential?\n\n Sure gonna help you digest, but it isn't essential.\n\n For some people it is.\n\n \r\nSo, I suggest you go into the Recipe Book and on page 146 and make the moisturizing formula.\n\n Make a good moisturizing formula and sip that throughout the day.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Honey For Pancreas, Honey Dissolved Bones \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHaving so much sugar, honey\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHoney isn't sugar when it's completely raw?\n\n The bees collect the nectar, nectar's 90% carbs, so it's sugar.\n\n When the bee collects it, it swallows it.\n\n It produces an insulin-like substance, which converts 90% of those carbs into enzymes for digesting proteins and fats.\n\n\r\nLet me give you an example.\n\n \r\nWhile I was in Thailand three months ago before I went to the Philippines, I went to see some patients on the Costa Mui island and they spearfished.\n\n So, I went spear fishing with them and one of the big fish that we caught had these big vertebrae's and the his Thai girlfriend who's almost 50 years old.\n\n\r\nShe grew up in the old country where they eat lots of raw foods, so she's a total raw fooder and eats everything perfectly even better than her American boyfriend who's on the diet.\n\n So, she's the ideal primal dieter.\n\n She'll go in and pick all the Japanese beetles off of her flowers and all day long she eat them live.\n\n\r\nYou have to understand, Thai's eat a lot of insects cuz there isn't a lot of meat there cuz they over hunted and the population got so large, so they eat a lot of insects, I mean, scorpions, cockroaches that are this big, all these things.\n\n Eat them raw, even alive.\n\n\r\nSo, she had these vertebraes, big vertebraes like this, and her teeth are so good, 50 years old, perfect teeth, and she's eating these bones.\n\n I wish I could have eaten a bone, I mean, she gave me a little piece of one and I just kept it in my mouth for hours.\n\n I took a half a teaspoon of honey and put in my mouth with the bone and disintegrated the bone in five minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, my question is, eating the honey isn't that going to spike the blood sugar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat did I just say?\n\n You've got insulin in the honey?\n\n The bee has created an insulin.\n\n If you heat that honey over 93°, you've destroyedthe insulin and it goes back to sugar.\n\n You're gonna spike.\n\n \r\nHowever, honey can cause old toxic glycogen in your body to detox, then you're going to spike, but you never look for your sugar level.\n\n You look for symptoms.\n\n If you're passing out, if you can't breathe, you've got an insulin problem.\n\n That's the only time if you're passing out, not because you're getting up too fast, but you don't have enough blood sugar to run the brain and nervous system and lungs, you've got diabetes.\n\n\r\n85% - 90% of the people who the medical profession put on insulin to and call diabetic are not diabetic.\n\n They just have sugar balancing sugar level problems.\n\n \r\nIf you've got a true insulin problem, you're not metabolizing your sugars to run your brain and nervous system, you're not going to breathe.\n\n You're gonna go into a coma in three days.\n\n If you don't have any of those symptoms, you are not diabetic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI read to tell if you have an insulin problem, if you weigh yourself in the morning, and then if you go up 1 pound - 1.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolute bullshit.\n\n\r\nYou can have water retention.\n\n You can have high blood pressure, will do the same thing.\n\n \r\nYou have to understand the pharmaceutical industry makes their money off of you taking drugs.\n\n They're gonna do everything they can to get you to take drugs.\n\n Every test in the world, they're going to show you need to take drugs now, like say cholesterol.\n\n\r\nNow, they used to say that 50 years ago, cholesterol levels of 300 were okay.\n\n Now, they're not saying that.\n\n They want people to take all these, the anti-cholesterol medications to lower cholesterol, so they dropped it way down into 150 and 160 to keep making money.\n\n It's all about making money.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Honey, How To Know If Unheated \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd what's the true honey you told me about\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I got a Filipino honey where we just went to a beekeeper and they gave me honey straight from the hive?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you know if the honey's good, because they said if the honey crystallized, that means it's real honey, so I have honey that's just liquid.\n\n Stays liquid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, well all honey will crystallize if it's raw.\n\n Sage honey can take up to a year, year and a half to crystallize.\n\n It depends upon the honey.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how about if it doesn't crystallize in three months that's not sage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt still depends upon the type of honey?\n\n\r\nIt could take anywhere from three months to a year and a half for honey to crystalize.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, so the question is how do I get to know that's real, honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to go to the place who makes the honey?\n\n \r\nWhat brand is it.\n\n \r\nIt's gotta say unheated?\n\n We do not heat this honey at all in processing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt says raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRaw doesn't mean a thing.\n\n Raw they can heat it up to 170°.\n\n Honey can't be heated over 93°.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, so in the book says, just say raw honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn my book?\n\n No, it says we do not heat this honey in processing and it stays unheated?\n\n\r\nAnd then you have to ask the beekeeper.\n\n \r\nIt's gotta say unheated, raw doesn't mean a thing.\n\n I say that in the book.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDon't take his word for it.\n\n Go watch him take it out of the hive.\n\n That's the only way to know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's the only way to truly know.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nbeekeepers won't heat your honey.\n\n Only the big ones do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, little ones will do it too to bottle it faster.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey also heat it when it crystallizes, the water back it up to 120°.\n\n \r\nAnd then I'll ask them, have you ever heated the honey.\n\n And they'll say, No?\n\n And then I ask them, what's your bell heater for your five gallon bucket or your water heater.\n\n What do you set the temperature at?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just have to go to 'em?\n\n You have to say, listen, when you spin some honey, I'd like you to bottle some for me right then and there and don't strain it.\n\n Because you want it completely unheated.\n\n \r\nCause what they do is they spin it, put it in cauldrons, it will set, it'll get very thick and then they have to heat it to pour it fast.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut the guy in the store didn't want to give me the beekeepers address.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't say on the bottle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't say a name on the bottles.\n\n Don't they have a name and address of the producer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, he gets from a bulk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, then if he doesn't give it to you, I'd take it back to him.\n\n\r\nWell, there's some honeys that are available here you get right out of the store and there's Y.\n\nS there's quite a few of them Really Raw, those brands.\n\n\r\nThere is Honey Pacifica, but they don't sell that in regular markets.\n\n \r\n[At one point Honey Pacifica started feeding sugar in the winter, so Aajonus stopped buying.\n\n It may have changed since, I haven't checked.\n\n]\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Joint Problems, Leaky Gut, Lots Of Eggs \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I've got a lot of joint problems, including some deterioration.\n\n What can I do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends why you have it?\n\n 80% - 90% of all deterioration of the joints comes from leaky gut.\n\n Intestinal production mucus is very shallow and the mucus fibers are very open, so your own digestive acids and juices get into there and bacteria start eating your own intestinal walls.\n\n They get so thin that if you eat a lot at one time, drink a lot, it rips, the gut, and then you have leaky gut.\n\n You have undigested food that will go to the joints for digestion.\n\n It's 80% - 90% of all arthritis and rheumatism comes from that.\n\n So, I would say look to there first.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThen what's the best thing if that was the case.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a whole diet in itself for Crohn's, It's mostly eggs?\n\n You need anywhere from 24 - 32 eggs a egg.\n\n \r\nEggs digest in 27 minutes, only takes 3 - 5 inches of the intestine to absorb, completely digest and absorb eggs, so you get all this fat protein with very little energy expense on digestion.\n\n So, you get to reserve all of your intestinal tract and you reserve the energy absorbing, digesting and assimilating all the eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about butter.\n\n Would you eat butter with the eggs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTiny bit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because then you're causing a problem in digestion?\n\n\r\nI'm not saying don't eat any other thing, but I'd have to see his eyes to be able to determine what to suggest.\n\n \r\nRight off I would say eggs, sipping on milk, never gulping.\n\n You never gulp anything.\n\n The H20 rushes to the kidneys, you piss it out, so then you're nutrients cannot carry H2O to the cells, so you sip.\n\n\r\nYou see me when I sip, I don't sip, I suck.\n\n You see, when I do it, I suck.\n\n\r\nKeep my teeth together, put my tongue there, and I force whatever I'm drinking through.\n\n Why.\n\n Like a baby's sucking, gets all that bacteria into the milk?\n\n So, I digest very easily, so I never get dehydrated.\n\n \r\nAnd I drink maybe two quarts of fluid a day, but that's in the form of milk and the fruit and the meat.\n\n Meats 55% water, milk is 82% - 86% water.\n\n So, you have all of this fluid in your food as long as it's raw and it's all ionically attached.\n\n So, you can utilize a 100% of the water in your raw foods.\n\n \r\nOnce you cook it, you fractionate all of that.\n\n You drink water, same thing as eating salt, fractionates those smorgasborg of nutrient.\n\n Dilute your digestive acids, all kinds of problems.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou said fruit.\n\n What kind of fruit do you eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you saw me eat the watermelon rind?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's right.\n\n But you didn't eat it with cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI had some cream with berries first?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n Because I get heartburn from everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI always eat fat with my food.\n\n Always, always, always.\n\n And I say that in both books, always eat fat with fruits.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, could it be cheese or butter.\n\n Or does it have to be milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter what you want it to be?\n\n It be any of the fats: avocado, cheese, butter cream.\n\n \r\nJust remember, if you eat cream, it's harder to digest and you'll have a tendency to retain more water, but you still need at least two tablespoons of cream a day in addition to whatever's in your milk, unless you've added it to your milk already.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Motorcycle Accident \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHello folks\n\n I had another motorcycle accident six weeks ago.\n\n\r\nI took all the skin off from here to here, all of it off there.\n\n The reason this isn't healing like the last one healed in 12 days is I put the lime juice on it and then the honey, and then the coconut cream and then the meat.\n\n But this one didn't because I didn't hit pavement.\n\n\r\nThere was a road under construction in the Philippines and they use big rocks, not gravel, and they use layers of gypsum.\n\n Gypsums what they use in drywall, cause it's very drying, 5 times more drying than sulfur.\n\n So, they had layers of gypsum on this, and they had a section where there was a part of the road done, it was coned off, so you couldn't use it.\n\n And this was gravel with gypsum and the traffic is supposed to wait for one direction to finish before the next.\n\n They didn't wait for me to finish and a van came barreling 100 kilometers an hour, knocked me right off the bike and hit the gravel, didn't even stop.\n\n\r\nSo, this is all gypsum in here.\n\n You can see it looks like sandpaper.\n\n The lime in Philippines is not real lime, it's like orange.\n\n So, even though it's very green and small, it's more like orange.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what would be something that would be drawing that would pull the gypsum out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, gypsums gonna draw itself out and I did find that aloe helped?\n\n I strapped a piece of aloe to it, which helped for about a week.\n\n But I had to let the white cells just take it out.\n\n So, I lost a lot of white cells, that's why I'm very thin right now cause I lost a lot of fat.\n\n White cells are fat to pull the gypsum out.\n\n\r\nIt's almost finished now, but it's still very painful.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long is that.\n\n How many weeks?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's been six weeks?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSix weeks!\r\n\n\r\nWhen I had the accident two years ago, when I split this femur down the center and broke the tibia off into the femur joint.\n\n That took me only six weeks to heal, and I had twice as much skin gone.\n\n\r\nThis whole bone here was shaved off, this bone was shaved off and this bone shaved off and this healed fast because I didn't land on the gypsum like the leg did.\n\n So, this skin was all gone, this was ripped all the way down to the bone and all that was gone to the bone.\n\n But you see how quickly it goes without the gypsum.\n\n\r\nAnother problem was I went to get some honey and this woman sold me honey, it wasn't truly honey and I didn't find that out til 9 days of putting this other junk on.\n\n \r\nWhat they do is they make a honey, they've got a fruit in in Philippines that if you put it with sweet and low, that's what they do.\n\n\r\nIt was sweet and low.\n\n It tastes like Thai honey.\n\n So, I had just come from Thailand, so I saw Thai honey.\n\n I thought, oh they got Thai honey.\n\n So, after putting that on for nine days, and it was looking worse and worse and I knew it wasn't from just from the gypsum.\n\n \r\nSo, I asked the taxi driver to help me to apply it to work on it cause it was still open this far and it was quite a mess.\n\n So, he came in and he goes to put the honey on and said, \"This isn't honey.\n\n This is a mixture that they make and they call it Thai honey and it's really not.\n\n They make it with sweet and low or as you know, aspartame and all these chemicals\".\n\n\r\nSo I was drinking, I drank about a cup of that.\n\n Plus put it on my leg for all that time.\n\n So, for nine days I poisoned my body with this stuff.\n\n And then it caused an insulin detox.\n\n A lot of people who take insulin as they get older, the insulin builds up and it causes toxicity like this.\n\n\r\nAnd of course they have their toes amputated and feet and all on up.\n\n So, I hadn't had insulin since I was 22 years old, but for some reason that forced insulin detoxification.\n\n And I used to shoot it here in my thigh cuz I didn't like shooting in my arms, I shot it in my arms a lot, so I started getting the same detoxifications of insulin.\n\n\r\nIt smelled exactly like the insulin I used to shoot up.\n\n So, I had a big sore here that got this big, one on the back of the arm and another one here you can here.\n\n They're coming out and I haven't had insulin for 42 years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how did you detect that was what it was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe smell?\n\n Just like stuff I used to inject.\n\n It's got that sweet, odd odor to it.\n\n At least they did.\n\n I haven't had it in 42 years, so I don't know what it's like now.\n\n \r\nWhat's the insulin like now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI never took it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, you never took it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey wanted me to, but I never did.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, I will force it to puss a little bit and most of the time it will run the liquid the same color as the insulin.\n\n See, I won't break these because I want to keep pussing until it's clean.\n\n It will stop cussing once it's clean.\n\n\r\nNow, most people would run to the doctor.\n\n Doctor, say, \"Oh, you've got a staph infection.\n\n We need to give you a lot of antibiotics\".\n\n So what happens.\n\n\r\nThe poisons stay in the body, it poisons the body?\n\n The body stops digesting, can no longer detoxify.\n\n So, then all that matter would stay in there and cause problems.\n\n \r\nNow, since I was about 16 years old and started taking the insulin, I had these lumps in my thighs and my thighs were always very large.\n\n Right now, you can see on this leg too, but my legs are thinner than they've been since I was 15.\n\n5 years old, since I started taking insulin, but I had huge lumps in there that were sore.\n\n So, anytime I got a massage, even if it were a light massage I would have pain there.\n\n So, I would say you have to be very gentle with my calves.\n\n So, here I can push, there's no more lumps.\n\n \r\nSo, you just have to get through these things.\n\n You can't freak out cuz the medical profession get all their training in emergency wards, so everything is panic time.\n\n So, and then the pharmaceutical industry wants 'em to think that way because anybody will make a bad decision in a panic and fear.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, initially when that happened to you, did you just get lime on it right away or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said, the lime they have, there aren't actually lime?\n\n They're oranges, really.\n\n They're tiny oranges.\n\n So, that didn't work.\n\n \r\nAnd plus I didn't have the proper honey.\n\n I didn't have honey at all, until that taxi driver showed me that it was wasn't honey and then he took the, to the place and we got honey.\n\n And then the whole, the next day, 90% of the pussing stopped, 90% of the irritation stopped.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, will that scar over or not.\n\n Do you think that'll scar?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably not?\n\n This right here was just like this and this, there's no scarring there.\n\n So, just takes time.\n\n You just have to be patient, can't freak out and panic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, now what are you doing when you're home.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't do anything, but put urine on it?\n\n Anything else irritates it, coconut cream, anything irritates, except urine.\n\n So, I put old stinky urine on it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that does what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd that keeps it from drying out, getting very sore and it soothes it?\n\n \r\nNow, the urine is nothing other than the blood without the red and white blood cells.\n\n\r\nSo, all the nutrition that's in your blood is what's in the urine with a little ammonia added, so when I put that on, it gets a good supply.\n\n Now, right now, everything that it's getting up to the skin is irritated because of the chemicals.\n\n So, when I put the urine on, it's getting a fresh coat of nutrients like it would from the blood, from the outside in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust once a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI usually do once a day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you just pour it on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI pour it on?\n\n If I run my fingers over these areas right here, they're like crystals from the mineral buildup and the insulin.\n\n Cause the insulin has a tendency to crystallized, so it's very sharp.\n\n So, if I touch this, it'll stab inside and be painful.\n\n Even my pants can cause pain if they rub it the wrong one.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how about the one on your shoulder.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI just live with the pain?\n\n I just ignore it as much as possible.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the shoulder, you put urine on that too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n \r\nBut that's almost all over.\n\n These were huge.\n\n \r\nI used to shoot my insulin in this arm, until I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n Then I started shooting it mainly in this side, but once in a while on side.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you'll probably feel better after cuz all the crap.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what I mean?\n\n I think I'll not have that same soreness in the calf now.\n\n I'll be able to run better and I'll be able to take massages better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre you swollen quite a bit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, this whole calf, this whole ankle was swollen?\n\n \r\nBut if you consider the size of my calf, they have normally my calves were huge.\n\n So, actually my calf is smaller even with the swelling.\n\n So, when the swelling on both legs goes down, my calves are gonna be the smallest they've been since I was probably 13 years old.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you knew you didn't break anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, didn't break anything?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou didn't have any x-rays or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI didn't have to.\n\n When I had the accident 2.\n\n5 years ago, the pain was so excruciating in the knee and the shin that I knew I had broken it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you ever have a follow up with that doctor.\n\n\r\nNo?\n\n I wanted to wait till the leg could straighten and it's still not completely straightened.\n\n Straighten.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDid you have a short pants on when you fell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShort pants, short sleeved shirt with a helmet?\n\n Did have a helmet on.\n\n A rock flew up and hit me here, so I had an abrasion there and a couple here.\n\n But this time, I tumbled, I just let myself slide.\n\n When I saw this, I was falling over, I kicked the bike away, hit the gravel, and then flipped.\n\n So, I probably didn't skid on this for more than probably two feet before I started tumbling.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the lesson is.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDon't ride a motorcycle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I drove back, see I left at sunrise from the hotel to go down Palawan Island and I had just gotten there the night before late, and I'd rented the motorcycle just before this place closed at like 9:00 PM, and it was just a motorbike, 125.\n\n\r\nIt wasn't like a big motorcycle when I had this accident.\n\n That was a big Harley about 350 pound bike.\n\n This was probably 150 - 175 pounds.\n\n And, I left very early on a Sunday morning to go take a tour down the end of the island and they said most of the island doesn't have paved roads.\n\n\r\nSo, I knew I was getting into, but I had no idea there were crazy drivers that had no respect for anybody on a motorcycle.\n\n So, as soon as I had the accident, I was two hours down the island and I had to drive two hours back and I saw everybody on a motorbike when a car would come, they'd go over to the side and almost slow down to a stop.\n\n\r\nNow I've been on six other islands in the Philippines and nobody drove like that, but here they do no, respect for motorcyclists.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought you were gonna say not to trust anybody's that's honey and this and that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat too.\n\n I was really upset with that woman.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou couldn't taste it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey learned to mix it so well that it tastes identical to Thai honey; the thickness and everything?\n\n But it didn't react that way, I was getting dizzy, I was getting nauseous and I thought it was just the gypsum getting into the blood and it was the honey.\n\n\r\nIt wasn't until the 9th day till I got the true honey and then a lot of the symptoms stopped right away.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, you applied the honey for what.\n\n To heal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it helps heal?\n\n You read my books.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI talk about it increases healing five times.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Nausea, Vomit, Dog Licking \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI had another one of these major stomach pain episodes, like three hours, four hours\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd what, what are your symptoms.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust nausea, vomiting?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDiarrhea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, not at all?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n What what happens when you get nauseous have vomit; poisons dump into the stomach.\n\n Fr example, she'll put bacteria on you.\n\n Whenever a dog or cat licks you, they're putting bacteria, janitorial bacteria on to eat the dead cells and the bad tissue.\n\n We used to have a lot of salmonella now that we take showers and baths and we're so toxic in our environment the 6,000 varieties of salmonella that used to live on the skin and eat the skin are no longer present.\n\n So, dogs and cats will come up and lick and give you a dose of their bacteria from their mouths.\n\n We have more bacteria than they do, so you can lick youw own.\n\n\r\nI do that.\n\n I'll put saliva in here, go over it after I put the urine on it, cuz the ammonia in the urine is antiseptic and I need to re-infiltrate the bacteria.\n\n \r\nBecause the old urine doesn't absorb the same for some reason, don't know why.\n\n \r\nProbably as you let it sit, the ammonia breaks down and the antiseptic effect leaves.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, it's better fresh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's better non fresh?\n\n See, the kidneys manufacture ammonia to be able to separate the red and white blood cells from the blood serum.\n\n\r\nIf you pissed at all of your red and white blood cells from your blood and not just the fluid out of it, you'd be anemic all the time.\n\n You couldn't function, and you can only replace about 4 - 5 tablespoons of red blood cells in a day.\n\n So, if you urinate, let's say a quart a day, that would be a huge amount of red and white blood cell loss.\n\n \r\nThe ammonia is very active when your kidney first makes it to separate the red and white blood cells from it, so you can lose fluids.\n\n You lose fluids to get rid of some toxins sometimes, but that's not the major reason.\n\n \r\nIt's usually to keep the body warmer and you notice when you get cold, you urinate a lot.\n\n Thicken the blood, and then when you get very warm, then you stop urinating so much and your blood thins itself?\n\n You have more fluid in the bloodstream, less red and white blood cells.\n\n So, the kidneys are mainly for that, regulating body temperature.\n\n \r\nThe spleen can help there cuz it holds extra red blood cells, spleen doesn't manufacture anything like the kidney does, but the spleen holds excess red blood cells.\n\n \r\nLike say, when you were a cave person, you're swinging around in a tree, branch broke and as you were falling down the tree cut your juggler and you lost a cup of blood.\n\n \r\nNow you'd be at very anemic with a cup of blood loss and you'd probably be good dinner, cuz you wouldn't be able to run fast enough from a tiger or lion.\n\n So, the body has this reserve of red blood cells in the spleen.\n\n So, you can dump up to almost two pints of red blood cells right back into the bloodstream, so you're not anemic.\n\n\r\nYou know, that was a long answer.\n\n Anyway.\n\n \r\nThe poisons dump into the stomach that causes nausea, Any time you have nausea, poisons are dumping into the dumping into the stomach, and it's a good passage for that because we have hydrochloric acid there.\n\n The highest concentration in our bodies is in the stomach.\n\n\r\nSo, it's like the Indians when they used to get a snake bite, a poisonous snake bite, they knew it went to the stomach, so they'd try to get some milk or some corn, which has a lot of hydrochloric acid precursors or root beets and eat those, shave those.\n\n And they usually kept some around buried in case of poisonous bites from the snakes, scorpion or spider, whatever, and they would drink the milk or eat the corn or the beets and that would create more hydrochloric acid and help neutralize the poison.\n\n \r\nYou can take any kind of rattle poison, the worst in the world, copper head and you mix a little hydrochloric acid and neutralizes it like that.\n\n\r\nSo, that's what happens with our stomachs, used that way.\n\n So, when you get nauseous, your body's dumping the poisons there, wants to vomit it, or enough hydrochloric acid.\n\n And when you get nauseous, more hydrochloric acid, the more nauseous you get, the more hydrochloric acid dumps in, more the stomach manufacturers, dumps it into the stomach interior, so it neutralizes the poison.\n\n\r\nHowever, you can eat cheese, raw unsalted cheese and it will absorb those poisons so you don't have to use so much hydrochloric acid and you're not to experience all that nausea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy unsalted.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause when you have salted it fractionates the molecules, acts like cooked, and you will reabsorb and digest the cheese and you don't want to digest the cheese?\n\n\r\nYou want the poisons to send through the body and pass out with your feces.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're talking about a snake bike.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of a poisonous bite?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, with the salt, would sea minerals do the same thing.\n\n That's bad too or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSea minerals won't do it as well?\n\n However, clay can.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Osteroproosis \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n This is for a lady, my friend.\n\n She has osteoperosis, she's 42.\n\n She's getting a pre-osteoperosis problems.\n\n And I try her read in the book or something about that.\n\n And you just say that pasteurized milk causes that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, many things cause osteoporosis, but that's one of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat can she do to reverse the symptoms.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, like I said in the book, she can drink raw milk, she can eat lots of cheese?\n\n Cheese a couple of times a day with honey.\n\n When you eat cheese, raw cheese, no salt raw cheese with honey, you'll actually digest the cheese.\n\n\r\nNow any food that's dehydrated has no bioactive enzymes, difficulty to digest.\n\n Dog, and a cat can't even digest much raw cheese that's unsalted.\n\n Check the feces, passes out whole almost.\n\n Dog and a cat will get a high amount of hydrochloric acid, they may digest at the most 50% and human at the most 20%.\n\n\r\nIf you eat honey with it, you're providing enzymes to digest the minerals in the cheese and some of the fat and protein, so cheese all day long, and a little bit to absorb heavy metals and poison.\n\n Because when your body eats its own bone, it's doing it because it's low in calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium.\n\n\r\nThe alkalizing minerals to alkanize the acidic poisons in the body, and you produce a lot of the acidic poisons just by cooking food.\n\n Then if you add a all the food additives along with it, MSG and everything, you've got quite an array of toxins where your body has to use a vast amount of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus so it eats your own bones to do it.\n\n\r\nWell, many things cause osteoporosis, but that's one of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShe's in an environment that there is no raw milk at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShe needs to move or get some cows or goats there order.\n\n\r\nWhere does she live.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSan Paulo, Brazil?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI got milk in San Paulo.\n\n\r\nAll you had to do is go out, there are mountains around there and there are people with goats all over the place.\n\n You can get goats milk.\n\n She's just gonna have to have somebody go get it for her if she doesn't have the strength to go get it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the goat milk is okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you don't have anything else?\n\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Penicillin \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIris is in February\n\n You said, I've got a lot of penicillin in my body.\n\n What has that got to do with the fact that I can't digest cooked foods.\n\n That's why I'm on the diet?\n\n I'm on the diet almost four years and I do great as long as they eat everything that hetells me.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that was your rosacea and your splotching on your face.\n\n That's from the penicillin.\n\n \r\nNow what happens is, penicillin is a bird fungus.\n\n When birds have eaten grains that they haven't digested properly, and let's say they're breaking cells down and the body needs help, say they've gone through a long drought, then a fungus will appear.\n\n\r\nPenicillin will appear and help break down those cells that are built off of this carbohydrate, grains.\n\n We would never have penicillin in the human body, except that we eat grain food: breads, cakes, pastas; anything made of grain and the cells are made of those products, fungus can live off of.\n\n \r\nNow, we wouldn't normally have that variety of of penicillin, but the pharmaceutical industry is made of penicillin that when injected in us lives forever, because when they sterilize it, they damage the RNA and DNA to tell it to go into hibernation.\n\n That on and off switch.\n\n They damaged it, so it'll always be active.\n\n That doesn't mean that the penicillin is a bad thing because it will only eat damaged tissue that was built on grain foods, so with a lot of carbohydrate.\n\n\r\nSo, it's a beneficial fungus as long as it doesn't get out of control andmakes your life miserable.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's that connection with the, the fact that I here for several years wasn't able to digest food, cooked foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell that was cause you weren't digesting and absorbing anything because it was cooked, plus you have lots of toxicity in your intestines.\n\n It came to the point where you just can't digest, unless it's raw.\n\n And there's a lot of people that come to that point.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Salt \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOne lump of salt this big, pure sodium, sodium salt\n\n There's no chloride, there's no potassium, there's no iodine connected with it is more powerful than an atomic bomb.\n\n When your body takes in sodium chloride, potassium, sodium, or any of those table salts, it fractionate, it separates that, and the sodium becomes an isolated substance and it'll start causing tiny explosions in your blood.\n\n \r\nSo, when your cells go to eat, there's a smorgasborg of nutrients anywhere from 93 to 117 nutrients all coupled together.\n\n So, when a cell eats, the ions opens up, takes it in, it gets a whole smorgasborg, a complete balanced diet.\n\n When you eat salt, it causes these little explosions and all these things will fractionate into as small as 7 - 23, even 30 molecules is about the most.\n\n The cell is never getting a balanced diet again, that's what salt does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that would even the case with like sea salta.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter what salt?\n\n It's concentrated sodium and it's not sodium in a plant where your ions are properly bound with other nutrients, there's no regulation on it.\n\n \r\nYou can even kill a plant if you put salt in the ground and you'll kill a plant quickly, unless that plant is built to handle sodium, concentrated sodium.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, why is it there are so many animals that go into salt licks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut they only do it on a rare occasion?\n\n They also have problems for a few days and that way they won't touch it again for another year, two years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey must need it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they like that salty, sweet?\n\n They have a mineral need and maybe they're not eating enough dirt because they're in desert, because mainly all animals eat dirt with their food.\n\n All animals eat dirt with their food, every one.\n\n So, they're getting lots of minerals, but in a desert it isn't like that.\n\n\r\nThere's not a lot, there's sand that doesn't break down as easily as the minerals in dirt.\n\n Plus they've got a long digestive tract to take 'em through, to hold up and utilize the minerals.\n\n But when you have salt blocks, then you're dealing with all these side effects and dehydrating the body.\n\n\r\nWell you have to eat salt hydrate the body.\n\n Well if that's true, you could fricking drink the sea water.\n\n But what happens if you drink sea water.\n\n You will die?\n\n You will dehydrate.\n\n You got that, you will dehydrate and die from salt water and they say that the salt water in the ocean is the same concentration of salt in the blood, doesn't make any difference.\n\n In the blood it has many nutrients utilizing it in precise ways.\n\n In in sea water, you don't have that.\n\n If we were fish, be a different situation, but we're not fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you tell me what I would do when I have that reaction.\n\n Milk or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I would put a hot water bottle there very quickly?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, get out of the water.\n\n\r\nIf I even add all that stuff for water, is it probably still not enough to chelate everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt may not be enough?\n\n Your water belt now is so toxic with those fire contamination, I double that amount of stuff.\n\n What you might do is just double the vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what does the flame do.\n\n Why would a certain organ react and not another?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt probably isn't your spleen?\n\n, it's probably your pancreas.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd the pancreas is here and it's probably traveling a little bit with the nerves.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, is that like a poisons trying to get out a specific organ.\n\n Why do you get a pain in a certain area?\n\n \r\nIs it just triggering a detox?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCertain sound vibrations can cause people to detox certain things and you happen to be sensitive to the frequency of water, that's all I can think of?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoesn't the water also gas off the chemicals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you're breathing it in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, unless you have the milk in there to draw it down?\n\n\r\nYou can put clay in the water too to have extra insurance.\n\n \r\nNow that I have well water in Malibu Mountains Canyon.\n\n It's really nice water, no contamination.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Spleen \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRope and another branches, falling down a tree, cut your juggler and you lost a cup of blood\n\n Now, you'd be very anemic with a cup of blood loss and you'd probably be good dinner cuz you wouldn't be able to run fast enough from a tiger or a lion.\n\n \r\nSo, the body has this reserve of red blood cells in the spleen, so that you can dump up to almost two pints of red blood cells right back into the bloodstream, so you're not an anemic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Toxic Sperm \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSperm\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can use sperm, but if he's got that much metal toxicity up on his head, he probably has it around the other head too.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat sperm may not be so good.\n\n Your sperm smells metallic, don't use it.\n\n If it smells like it smells like an old iron, it's full of toxic minerals, don't wanna use it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Toxins In Water \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'll give like a pain where I think our spleens supposed to be or like in the corner\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSpleen?\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd so, I don't know what that is.\n\n And it started after I was detoxing, now I'm getting better it started to come on, like I'm getting in the bathtub and all of a sudden I have this pain where it's just like doubled over there, but water triggers it.\n\n\r\nNot drinking it, it's just being around water or even the running of a water.\n\n You don't have any idea what that might be.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can take a wild guess say you're allergic to water and the body's just warning you?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe chemicals in the water maybe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCould be the chemicals in the water?\n\n\r\nLA, there are 193 chemicals in the water.\n\n When I used to live in LA, in the city, LA whether it was Beverly Hills or Venice or Laurel Canyon, when I lived in those three places.\n\n \r\nI would get into the bath with nothing in it, I would be out in seven minutes, trembling, shaking, passing out.\n\n That's how toxic it was.\n\n So, I learned that I had to put milk, vinegar, and sea salt in the water, certain amount of it to control that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy sea salt, but you are opposed to salt.\n\n You're putting sea salt in in the water?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Taking it internally if you take it internally.\n\n Do you know the salt is more explosive than nitroglycerin.\n\n\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (31) What Aajonus Is Eating \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAajonus, are you stuffing yourself\n\n I mean, are you eating like crazy to add the nutrients to there?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm eating double the butter that I usually eat, but you have to understand this is taking a lot of nutrients?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI see that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI mean, that's a lot of nutrients.\n\n I'm losing blood and serum constantly.\n\n The swelling in here, the whole taking care of this cap and that whole toxic insulin, my ankle's, everywhere.\n\n Now this one's doing it too.\n\n \r\nI eat tremendous amounts.\n\n I eat almost double what I usually eat, double the meat, double the fat, everything.\n\n If I didn't, I would be ultra skinny.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Where To Live \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm almost retirement age, 66, and I'm ready to get outta here\n\n Where do I go.\n\n You travel all over the world, where is a good place to go?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends upon your comfort level?\n\n I'm comfortable in poverty.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does poverty mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPoverty means I don't need anything, but the food on the land?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that in the local land or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo running water?\n\n I've got a river waterfall, I'm happy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, where in the world else should we start with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on your comfort level, what can you live with and live without?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGive me some names so we can start investigating, iI don't know.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut do you wanna grow your own food.\n\n Cows?\n\n Is that's what you're talking about?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, no, we're not?\n\n Come on.\n\n That's what he talking about.\n\n into the group.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI don't mind the Theia thing where there's a group.\n\n How many more communities are like that around the world that you know about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNone?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's the only one.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nThere are some people in Asheville, South Carolina, wherever Asheville is?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey don't really have it together so much.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI haven't been there in a while, that's the only other one I heard of.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's cold there, it snows there.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nGo live with the Amish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo what Dennis does in Pangaea.\n\n He bought the land, he built the place and then he invites people to come and they work the land.\n\n\r\nThey do everything for him and he gets the food that they grow and they cut when they harvest.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I have been emailing that and I can certainly use an engineer.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Aajonus Injection Tooth Loss, Stringy Ammonia Arrests Toxins \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut when I got those three injections when I was kidnapped three years ago, I've lost six teeth because of that\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYour coloring's so much better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I was gray for a while.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI remember.\n\n You were so gray, it was scary.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou said you lost six teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSix teeth?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n Wow?\n\n\r\nWhat's the connection.\n\n I don't understand?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you know what's in a vaccine, it's a flu vaccine.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nMercury and shit like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n All that, poisoned my whole body.\n\n My skin went gray, I'm just now getting back.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo, basically what.\n\n It rotted the teeth or got to your teeth or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, went into the nerves and damaged the nerves, damaged the teeth?\n\n So, I was popping teeth out.\n\n Good teeth too, just killed the nerve.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's the vaccines that everybody's getting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n\r\nI didn't do it on purpose, I was kidnapped and injected.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou were kidnapped.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nKidnapped and injected?\n\n I was speaking out internationally against the swine flu hoax?\n\n So, they caught me in a hotel room, injected me with three of them to say, see he died of the swine flu.\n\n But I happened to wake up when they were injecting me and I caught them, so I knew what to do the next morning.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's like the government, is that what you talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCould have been pharmaceutical industry?\n\n It's traumatic cause I'm just now getting, I still have tremendous pain in this arm right there all the way up under here.\n\n It's been eight months now.\n\n Like when I was a kid and got tetanus shots and everything, I could never lift the arm this much without excruciating pain.\n\n\r\nIt's been that way on some days.\n\n Like right here, the pain is pretty sharp, up here it's okay.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI would think as strong as you are that you'd be able to withstand them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThree.\n\n\r\nThree of those, do you much mercury they injected?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe'd be a dead man!\r\n\n\r\nI should be dead?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTotally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut the reason I only survived cuz I went out and found the stingray that was 2.\n\n5 days old and the high ammonia.\n\n See, if you get natural ammonia, it'll bind with mercury and other substances, so it doesn't go into the blood cells because that's what it would do is destroy my red blood cells and I die.\n\n \r\nSoon as I woke that next morning and realized it wasn't a nightmare, I had three bubbles there with a hole injected in it, a little serum coming out, I ached in every joint, I was sick, I started vomiting.\n\n As soon as I tried to sit up, I vomited, I had diarrhea.\n\n Called the hotel, and immediately I said, I need a driver, I need one as soon as possible.\n\n So, the driver came, took him about 30 minutes, I did my vomiting, ate some cheese, ate some butter, vomited all of that.\n\n \r\nAnd then he came and I said, \"I need to get to a wharf and I need to find shark or stingray as soon as possible\".\n\n And I wasn't gonna explain why, but he could see I was pretty sick.\n\n And I mean, he had to help me walk, if I walked for five minutes I was on the ground.\n\n So, when I got that way, I had to get on my knees fast and get on the ground, so I wouldn't hurt myself from falling.\n\n That was three of those, just to get to the van, three times did that, I passed out in the van multiple times as we were driving two different wharfs, and we found the baby stingray about this big, been dead for 2.\n\n5 days.\n\n They were getting ready to pitch it.\n\n Perfect, chuck that thing up, ate it, vomited.\n\n Finally got some of that to stay down and digest it and then as soon as the ammonia started binding, chelating with those poisons in my blood, I was able to breathe again, and I stopped passing out.\n\n But that went on for almost two days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou ate any particular part of the stingray or just the whole thing.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI didn't care?\n\n The part that was the stinkiest in ammonia, that's what I picked.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nCould you use urine cuz it's got ammonia in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt wasn't enough?\n\n You need some strong ammonia like from shark or a stingray for that and my urine would've been highly toxic already.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSomebody else's urine.\n\n \r\nSo, ammonia is the one thing that removes a lot of toxicity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't remove it, it binds with it so it doesn't get into the cell.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnything else binds with stuff like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot like that?\n\n Well, you've got amino acids in raw apple cider vinegar is very helpful with that.\n\n It's got the amino acids that bind with those substances.\n\n\r\nJoe, you're missing all this stuff.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's been taping.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, he's been taping it.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe wouldn't've forgotten about that if I didn't tell him.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWould you recommend that for people who've been forced to take vaccines, like military.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nJust the same as you just described here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIn the formulas of apple cider vinegar and amino acids, how would you take it for the vaccines?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably with coconut cream would be the best way to mix it?\n\n Coconut cream and little milk.\n\n I'd probably say if somebody had a vaccine, one vaccine, probably three tablespoons of vinegar a day, but one at a time, so space it, it and about three tablespoons of coconut cream and two tablespoons of dairy cream.\n\n Protect the nerves, about two ounces of milk\r\nAnd have that three times a day.\n\n If you've got military, I would suggest two tablespoons, three times daily for about 9 days.\n\n \r\nBut if you're going to have that quantity, you have to eat about three tablespoons of cheese with two teaspoons of honey, 4 - 5 times a day to make sure you don't demineralize.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Avocado Are Hard To Digest \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI've had the same issue, but found that eating an avocado in the evening\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, avocado, it's very difficult to digest.\n\n So, 50% of it is going to go out the feces.\n\n**[Cathy]**\n\r\n Avocado's not good, you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I say it's good, but I mean, half of it, you're gonna to pass out with the feces?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut at least it helps, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDefinitely, yes?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Best Time To Do Baths and How To Stay Cool In Baths \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMy question was basically anything else that's changed in the baths since the book\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I used to say do it in the afternoon, nobody can do it in the afternoon?\n\n So, do it in the evening.\n\n And I say to everybody, to get your 90 minutes in, first 30 minutes you go in there, do it sleep time, time you to go to sleep, get in the hot tub.\n\n\r\nIf you have a hot tub, it's great because then you can go to sleep in it, no problem because it'll stay that temperature.\n\n If you got a bathtub, you have to wake every 20 minutes to let some water out and reheat it, and also when it's so hot, it's hard to sleep when it's 110°.\n\n\r\nWhen it's 105°, it's okay, but if you get heat frustration, you have a bowl of cold water with ice cubes floating on top and a wash rag in it.\n\n When you get heat frustration, you just can't take it, you don't want to be in there anymore.\n\n Take that cloth, ring it just a little bit, put it down, cold water will run down your head and your face, and then put your fists, not tight, open fist into the bowl up to here to your high wrist.\n\n= and you hold it in there for only two minutes.\n\n \r\nNow it's the brain that doesn't like to get hot, so that will go from the bone right up into the skull bone and it cools the body pretty quickly, and the body loves heat.\n\n The brain doesn't, so that chills it fast.\n\n\r\nSo, you've got another 20, 30 minutes.\n\n Usually when that happens, you do that, you may only do it one time and you don't have to do it again.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe problem with a lot of people, they just fall asleep when they don't wake up in time to change the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey need a timer for every 20 minutes then, a little kitchen timer, 20 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI found that just room temperature water poured on your face a little bit, it feels fantastic because there's still so much difference between the bath water and room temperature water.\n\n So, just room temperature water, just pour a little bit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI find it doesn't work for a lot of people.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWon't cool you down too long, but it feels so good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it does.\n\n Some people just can't breathe and need to get out and I don't want them to get out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I got frostbite from putting a cold pack on the side of my face.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot supposed to put a cold pack, supposed to put a cold rag on there and not all ice cubes and a ice pack.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, I have a cold pack I put on, the old fashioned kind when it get too hot.\n\n I just slip that here for a minute or so.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nIt's not direct on the skin though.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy would it not be direct on your skin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it can actually damage your skin like he got frostbite?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI had a huge stain on the side of my face.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot a good idea to use ice directly, it's a risk.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat's the temperature.\n\n The risk?\n\n What's the temperature of hot tub?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n105° - 110°?\n\n It's up to you how hot you want it.\n\n Not above 110° cuz 111° you start destroying the vitamins and enzymes in your skin.\n\n\r\nThat's why saunas and steam baths are horrible for the mucus membranes and your eyes and the ears.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\n105° is the minimum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n105° minimum, 110° maximum?\n\n But you know, when you're doing a hot bath and you have a heater, you get down to 102°.\n\n Then it's time to change, unless you want to do it every 12 minutes then you start at 110° - 111°, goes down to 105°, you know, then you can heat it again.\n\n But that means heating at about every 12 minutes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Bone Minerals, Soup, Thick Bodies, Weston Price \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's all cauterized\n\n Only thing you're gonna get that's whole and active are the poison metals in the bone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if it's organic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't make any difference?\n\n Once you cauterized them, you are causing free radicals.\n\n See minerals naturally in a raw form, they work together in a perfect balance.\n\n Once you cook them, the calcium, the phosphorous, potassium, magnesium are crystallized and hardened either like a rock or like glass depending on the temperature, so they are no longer active.\n\n \r\nIt takes 20 times more calcium to do what calcium needs to do and still doesn't do it very well.\n\n\r\nIs there a way to pull out those minerals in a different way, like soak them in something or is that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot necessary?\n\n Eat your cheese and honey together?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's nothing in a bone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat that will do anything different better?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou wouldn't be sucking the marrow out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, the marrow is different?\n\n\r\nThe marrow is the only place you're going to get a lot of stem cells.\n\n So, that's good for that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you can get most of it just by pushing it out anyway.\n\n I mean the marrow's not really within the bone itself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's in that center.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think for people on a cooked diet, soup would probably be somewhat beneficial for them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt would be, but what's going do is, you remember John Travolta and how thin he was?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd how thick he is now.\n\n Well, that's what it creates.\n\n Remember Kevin Costner.\n\n\r\nYou remember him in No Way Out?\n\n Skinny?\n\n Now thick all over.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd Val Kilmer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, same way.\n\n These people eat lots of bones, soups and broths and stuff like that, cuz of Sally Fallon.\n\n So, then they have all these minerals you can't use in the fluid system, so they go into the bone, so they keep developing all this bone and thick tissue.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying John Travolta followed that diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe does pretty much, yeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I didn't know that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA lot of those stars do.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWho's that from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the Price Foundation?\n\n She left because of me.\n\n\r\nThere's 12 Board of directors of Price Pottenger and when my book came out, 9 of them wanted to go Gungho on mine and dump hers  She, Mary Enig and another person on the board after a year and a half of fighting the president and all the other people wanted to favor, my diet is better, they left.\n\n So, Mary Egg and Sally Fallon went off and created The Western Price Foundation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, that's how it's different.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat was the original board that you're talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPrice Pottenger Foundation?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, and this is the Western Price Foundation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought they were basically the same thing.\n\n Man, we different or interesting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTheirs is out of DC, and this one is out of San Diego, LA.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoes she recommend bone broth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Probably half of the foods are cooked.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nFor what reason.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to read her books?\n\n We're not gonna discuss that here.\n\n\r\nThe broths will allow you to absorb a lot of minerals in the bone broths, but it's going to be unavailable, thickened, hardened tissue.\n\n Not to help clean lactic acid outside the body, not to help neutralize anything in the in the blood or over acidity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bone Soaking & Grating, Swollen Tissue \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWarm water with some kind of maybe apple cider vinegar that would actually pull out some kind of nutrients\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMight take months to get a balance out of it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou could just let it sit, it's kind like a high meat.\n\n You would just let it sit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it just hardens?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut in a liquid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, in a liquid?\n\n Steep it for months.\n\n\r\nI would probably put, if you've got a cup of water, I'd put 4 drops of apple cider vinegar in it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIn what.\n\n In the bone marrow?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI just said, you've got 8 ounces of water, you put 4 drops of raw apple cider vinegar into the water and then you put the bones in that to sit for a few months and then you're gonna get some of that out?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou've never tried that, right.\n\n You were saying that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it was so much time consuming, and a hassle and I kept checking and checking.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou did actually do that though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I tried it?\n\n I've experimented with everything.\n\n\r\nProbably the thing that worked the best was I took fresh bone and I had a good stainless steel, hard grater.\n\n And I grated, shaved the bone and then let that sit for a week in apple cider vinegar and drank that.\n\n I could tell a difference.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou wouldn't be getting the sharp part of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSure?\n\n But if you got enough mucus, you'll be fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust break it down anyway.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n The hydrochloric acid will break down bone if it's shaved and thin like that.\n\n Of course.\n\n If it's been soaked in the vinegar water, it's softer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, that's true.\n\n\r\n4 months you did that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nthat was the longest in experimenting with hard, solid bones?\n\n \r\nBut the grated, the longest I ever waited was probably 2.\n\n5 weeks.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou leave it outside in a jar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWith a sealed lid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI did it sealed and unsealed, it didn't seem to make a difference?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, you just grate the bone.\n\n How much of did you grate down?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I grate it down a lot just cuz I put it in different jars and experiment with different ways?\n\n I did it with lemon juice and lemon juice helps fermentations and it helps bacterial breakdown in fermentation, but it doesn't work with bone very well.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAre you saying that bone marrow, raw bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no.\n\n We're talking about minerals.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So, you are talking about minerals coming from bones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n From the bone.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou're not talking about bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJust the minerals from the bones.\n\n Which particular minerals are you talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll of them?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm just saying that, a bone has so much that you can't extract in any other way it seems, but heating, but I guess you could from putting in something acidic, I guess.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr shaving it and putting it in something acidic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, are you saying that if your cooking bone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's why I'm saying that in the beginning, that it seems like that's the only way to extract those.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo you're saying if you are cooking bone in water that it actually extracts the minerals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, it does?\n\n It breaks them down and they don't bind together anymore.\n\n It destroys the ion attraction and magnetic sealing of it.\n\n So, then they all fragment just like any cooked food and if you're doing it in water, of course you got water penetrating in there as a solvent, so you've got it all coming apart.\n\n.\n\n\r\nSo, you free up those minerals but they're cauterized.\n\n Good for building bone and hard skin, but not live skin and not live bone.\n\n  \r\nIt's like, let's say you live in the desert and you go barefoot.\n\n You look at these Arabs and they've got 1.\n\n5\" - 2\" of callous.\n\n There no live cells in there, that's all dead cells.\n\n It's like a fibroid tumor.\n\n Well, that's the way, when you build with that kind of mineral content, you don't build live cells.\n\n You just build mummified tissue and it expands the girth, but not the life.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt'd be hard to get rid of that once you grow that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, absolutely?\n\n You have to start eating tons of vinegar to start dissolving it, getting rid of it.\n\n And then you're gonna dissolve your teeth and nerves and you're gonna have a lot of imbalances.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt's not a good idea to do it then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n You don't cook your bones to get that kind of minerals out.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nNo, no.\n\n I mean to to grate it and what you were talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n That's a good way to get those minerals if you want bone minerals, but eat cheese and honey.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo Costner and them, you were saying they're big because of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll of the cooking the broths and stuff like that.\n\n\r\nJust all that minerals that can't be in live tissue, so it cauterized so they build it into bone and thickness of skin.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, their bodies aren't using the minerals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, look at me.\n\n I'm the same size as I was since I was when I was a teenager, same bone structure, nothing's grown.\n\n\r\nI just saw my cousin today I'm a year and 9 months older than he is.\n\n I mean, his skin is thick, it's broadened, Jew nose is huge.\n\n I don't get all that cause I don't eat cooked food.\n\n I don't have all those cauterized minerals to add all this adipose tissue onto my body.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut you're saying that their bodies are not using the minerals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're using them to build tissue, birth, but no life?\n\n They just collect calcium, everything.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the body's not doing anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's just like adding plaster?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Cavities, Composite Instead Of Ceramic (porcelain) \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I've got a couple of cavities my dentist wants to use BPA translucent polycrystalline aluminum oxide as a filling\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust get a regular composite.\n\n Is this on a top side of a molar or is it facial.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's number 27?\n\n Actually, I got smaller ones in 26 and one on 27.\n\n**[unclear]**\n initially, and I've checked that against the Clifford testing that I used, and that's counter-indicated for that material.\n\n It's just that this is an aluminum type ceramic that I don't know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe actually wants to put ceramic filling.\n\n Anytime you use a ceramic, you have to drill out twice as much tooth and you snap it in and it causes cracking of teeth in many situations?\n\n\r\nI used to recommend porcelain and ceramic, but because they said to snap them in, too many teeth cracked, too many people have extended pain from because the pressure in the tooth, I stopped recommending it.\n\n I just say do the composite, the hard plastic, some of it's high aluminum, but it's solid there in the plastic and use the light to solidify it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well that's what he has there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's good.\n\n That's fine.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, what about porcelain instead.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCan't use porcelains, it's hard?\n\n They have to snap it in, stretches the tooth, cracks them.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou can't put porcelain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I mean, that's just what I said?\n\n You cannot put a hardened substance in there.\n\n You have to put soft substances that will harden.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd the soft substance is.\n\n uh, plastic composite?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nComposite, yeah.\n\n Hardened plastic.\n\n They use metal to harden it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey have a different type of drill, they use a water laser  that supposedly you don't have to use anesthetic with that.\n\n\r\nIt's the highest tech that they have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey have, what they call glass, but it's sand and water.\n\n They have the laser in water and they have the regular drill bit with water jet.\n\n \r\nLook into somebody else cuz you'll have no pain as long as you've got a water jet.\n\n Whatever they use, doesn't matter as long as there's a water jet on it.\n\n \r\nCan't use porcelain.\n\n It's gotta be hardened, you've gotta snap it in, you have to remove a lot of tooth to do that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd what are your composite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPlastic, a different ytpe of plastic?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd there's aluminum in the plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends upon the manufacturer, whose brands you're using?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Chemtrails \n \n**[2013],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe reason I got into the chemtrail issue, this is about in 2006, is because I developed the breathing difficulties\n\n I had heart palpitations and I couldn't get enough air, even now I was a few days ago coming home, I know it's sad because I can look up and I can see and what you're seeing is not a picture because I recognize that many people have this problem.\n\n\r\nIt was announced by Russ County on Sky watch.\n\ncom.\n\n He said it's been tested on rats that it can induce heart attack.\n\n Now ,what I'm asking the, question is, what do you take for this.\n\n You use garlic?\n\n What do you do?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI put it in my newsletter, all about the chemtrails and what to eat?\n\n\r\nI go into it in detail of what to do.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's better just to get it from there because that's already written.\n\n That's out there.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat date is it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably 3 years ago, 2?\n\n5 - 3 years ago.\n\n Do you remember it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\n3 years ago comes to mind?\n\n \r\nBut you heard from somebody chewing garlic.\n\n Is that validity at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat's garlic got in it?\n\n It's got some oil and some of the esters might chelate with some of the toxins, but that's not gonna change?\n\n The problem is when those poisons get into the lungs, they get into the red blood cells.\n\n The red blood cells can no longer transport oxygen to the cells to generate energy.\n\n So, even though you're getting oxygen in the lung, you're not utilizing it in the body for the red blood cells to deliver it to the rest of the cells in the body to produce energy.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nThat's because of the chemtrail chemicals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEating something with high ammonia will help that, so they don't get into the red blood cells?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCoconut cream doesn't have ammonia.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it doesn't have ammonia in it?\n\n You'd have to get some rotten fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOr apple cider vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the way I do it with apple cider.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWith the fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, just apple cider vinegar?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust drinking some.\n\n A tablespoon by itself?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I talked about having a tablespoon with coconut cream?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou taped it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou were asleep when I talked about it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, a tablespoons of each.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I've got it all?\n\n It's just taped on there so you can get it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you think chemtrails has anything to do with of fatigue.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can have a lot to do with it, yeah?\n\n You got great red blood cells.\n\n \r\nYou shouldn't have any fatigue, unless the red blood cells are not delivering the oxygen.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo, I should look that chemtrail thing up and do it, see if it makes a difference.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You have good red blood cells.\n\n I can see it in your skin.\n\n Your red blood cells aren't transporting oxygen.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe source is chemtrails is what you're saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it can be a lot of things with the old injections that you had cause you've got a lot of greyness in your skin, so that means you've got heavy metals in your skin, they're getting into the blood and of course they attach and affect the red blood cells and they can't transport oxygen?\n\n\r\nSo, you need to get something in there to bind with those poisons so they don't attach to the red blood cells and prevent them from utilizing oxygen.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd so go back and read your article above the chemtrails.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, or just what I said too?\n\n You use the raw apple cider vinegar with the milk or cream and coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo honey?\n\n Honey would make you want to absorb it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou could just gulp it down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's quite tasty, so I don't know that you want to gulp it, I sip it?\n\n I like the taste.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou gave the exact amounts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep, exact amounts?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nEveryone has a different reaction to it.\n\n This guy on the show, he can actually smell and taste it.\n\n\r\nNot very many people can do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen chemtrails are going on I don't go outside without a mask.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, really.\n\n What mask do you use?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI use my Israeli gas mask?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo heavy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't care.\n\n I don't want that crap getting into my eyes and my nose and my mouth.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou can walk around this area.\n\n But not driving?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've been pulled over, even by the border patrol?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI only use that I can breathe mask, that's all I use.\n\n That's a cotton mask.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's not gonna do a lot.\n\n It'll help, you're gonna have to wash it often.\n\n When I've got chemicals like that, that little cloth isn't gonna help.\n\n\r\nI use that cloth, that kind, in fact, I triple mine.\n\n I'll show you what I use on airplane.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do they say to you when they pull you over.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey think I'm a terrorist about to go bomb someone?\n\n\r\nNobody uses the gas mask like that, unless they're a terrorist.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhere did you get all those masks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI had this one made in Vietnam about 10 years ago?\n\n This is a organic cotton handkerchief and I roll it up, fold it and then roll it like this, and this goes here.\n\n I don't like the thing covering my whole face.\n\n I breathe through my nose and out my mouth.\n\n So, I go like this.\n\n\r\nI have so many layers that all the poisons have to get through, the benzene in the airplane is not gonna get to me.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut I can wear that if I'm protesting with the sign or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It completely covers the nostrils in many layers.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo, you use that when you fly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAny other times.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnce in a while if I smell something, and I'm in the car, I have my bag with me?\n\n I'll pull it out anytime I smell something that's a problem.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhere do you get an organic cotton handkerchief.\n\n Just online?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI got this probably 10 years ago when they had this made too?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSee, that's the thing.\n\n Years ago, the cotton we're just so totally different, free of GMOs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can still get organic cotton pretty easily.\n\n**[Nancy]**\n\r\nSo, Aajonus, are there a lot of chemtrails in the San Diego area.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, yeah?\n\n You've got quite a bit today.\n\n I watched them streaking the sky.\n\n I mean, not like you do in Los Angeles.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt's true, Nancy, whenever you see the streaks, that's them doing their thing.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI have the I can breathe mask and if I go out, just fold that Cotton handkerchief and do it that way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can do it that way?\n\n And if you're talking, then you want to have the mask to cover your face cuz you have a tendency to breathe through your mouth talking.\n\n \r\nWhen I have this one, when you you have a tendency to breathe through the mouth.\n\n So, if I'm going to talk in an airplane, I've got it down here, then I will talk to you through it like that because everybody breaths through their mouth when they're talking.\n\n\r\nBut otherwise I breathe through my nose and out my mouth.\n\n I've even trained myself where I can breathe through my nose and out my mouth while I'm asleep.\n\n Because I sleep on the planes, I force myself to stay awake.\n\n Soon as that plane starts moving, I can be asleep like a baby.\n\n So, I force myself to stay awake till I get to where I can take my seatbelt off cuz I don't like that radiation being attracted to that buckle.\n\n So, as soon as I get up there, it's off.\n\n Sometimes I don't make it, I'm sleeping.\n\n I wake up three hours later, the seatbelt's still there, but I've learned to breathe through my nose and out my mouth while I sleep a while.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Chlamydia, Antibiotics \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm living in a house with eight people right now and 2/8 people, two guys have chlamydia right now and they've both taken two doses of antibiotics and it hasn't gone away\n\n And I don't really know to tell them, cause you don't really believe in STDs, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's not an STD?\n\n Any fungus can change bodies, cuz fungus is in the skin or in the tissues inside.\n\n \r\nFungus lives in the skin and that and crabs, lice, they're contagious.\n\n\r\nBut if you put lime juice where you think that you might be subjected to it, it'll kill it.\n\n It'll kill it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere do you put lime juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they'd have to have the lime juice formula?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat would you do for the lice.\n\n My granddaughter has some and some of my kids in school have lice?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLime juice, and honey.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJust eating that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, put it on the body?\n\n It's literally 3/4 of a cup of lime juice and one teaspoon of honey only.\n\n Put it where the lice is.\n\n\r\nYou could do the same thing with chlamydia, but you drink it, you drink like 3 ounces of lime juice with three tablespoons of honey and one tablespoon of lemon juice and, four tablespoons of coconut cream.\n\n\r\nThey have to have that two times a day if they've got it really bad for about maybe six days.\n\n \r\nFive days of antibiotics destroy 1% of the body.\n\n \r\nOn this diet, you can recover 2.\n\n5% a year.\n\n If you're not on this diet, you might not recover anything, every antibiotic destroys 1%.\n\n Five days of antibiotic destroys 1% of the body's activity.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nMy daughter had lice.\n\n  They just got rid of them with salt water.\n\n The little eggs they contracted, they dry out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut it really damages the skin too.\n\n\r\nBut that's okay, if you rinse it all fast.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat did your daughter have.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nShe worked at daycare center with little kids and she caught lice?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's good.\n\n It'll dehydrate and kill 'em, shriveled them up.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Constipation, How Much Urine From Fluid \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMost of that's gonna urinate out\n\n You can tell, if you're drinking a quart of water a day, you should be only urinating a cup.\n\n \r\nSo, if you collect your urine for the day and how much fluid, if it's not one fourth of which you've consumed, you're chugging your fluids.\n\n\r\nYou should be absorbing and utilizing perspiring 3/4s of which you're eating, 75% and only urinating 1/4, 25%.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOnly a quarter of a cup.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Well, if you're eating a cup, then you should only urinate 1/4 of the cup.\n\n Otherwise, you're drinking your fluids too fast and that will cause dehydration.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that causes constipation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI see.\n\n I think sometimes maybe there's a blockage, cuz when I do go to the bathroom where it's like trying to squeeze through and it's just a thin thing.\n\n I don't know if there's a blockage in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's not blockage.\n\n What texture is it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSoft?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're not constipated, your body is robbing everything out as it can.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI've had the same issue, but found that eating an avocado in the evening.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, avocado is very difficult to digest, so 50% of it's just going to go out the feces.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, avocados not good, you said.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, I say it's good, but I mean, half of it, you're just going to pass out with the feces, \r\n\n\r\nBut at least it helps with going to the bathroom?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, right?\n\n I wouldn't suggest that for her.\n\n She doesn't have the dryness you have.\n\n\r\nI prefer anybody don't give suggestions when I'm giving suggestions because we're just gonna confuse the people.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what would be the difference and what would she do that would be different.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I just told her, she needs to sip things, other than gulping?\n\n That'll help a lot if.\n\n\r\nIf your fecal matter were coming out very hard and then soft, that means that your colon is starved for fats, fresh fats.\n\n \r\nSo, you could just inject some raw cream or coconut cream and butter into your rectal area and let it all absorb in there so you get the fresh fats.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike an enema.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, like a suppository?\n\n \r\nYou just take like.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\nthree tablespoons of butter\r\nthree tablespoons of cream\r\nthree of coconut cream.\n\n\r\nquarter teaspoon of honey.\n\n \r\n\r\nPut it in a four ounce jelly jar.\n\n Shake it, put it in a bowl.\n\n Hot water.\n\n Not hot enough to burn your hand.\n\n \r\nI'm gonna belch a lot cause I mixed a lot of different foods, only time I have that problem, but it was so tasty.\n\n But this is one that I didn't have a lot of spicy stuff, so I won't be passing wind for two days, which I usually do.\n\n So, at least I won't have that.\n\n I'm belching.\n\n \r\nSo, you put in a bowl of hot water and not hot enough to burn your hands.\n\n Well, you know, for about five, six seconds.\n\n That's long enough.\n\n It doesn't burn your hand, but it makes it a little uncomfortable.\n\n It's that hot, it's perfect.\n\n And after about four minutes, take a bulb syringe.\n\n If you've got an 8 oz syringe, you've got 4 oz - 4.\n\n5 oz of fluid.\n\n You want to squeeze it all out, you want to suck it up and let it out only till you have all the fluid in there.\n\n Don't open up, cuz then you'll put a lot of air in you and that can be painful.\n\n So, you just open it up until you have enough of all of the ingredients in there, and then you get all four bark like a dog, squirt it in yourself.\n\n And then just when you're down, get down on all fours, you can do it this way or this way, whatever way you like.\n\n\r\nAfter it's in there, go down, like this on your hands, on your face and all your stomach has going to get it to move up the descending colon and then lie on your right.\n\n Do that for about four minutes, you don't have to do it fast or hard.\n\n just wrist.\n\n And then go on your right side.\n\n Lift your left leg, and move your stomach again.\n\n\r\nAnd that'll get it to move over the transverse colon and down the ascending colon.\n\n Just four minutes on each side, so it's 4, 4, 4.\n\n \r\n4 minutes in the hot water, 4 minutes rolling in your stomach while you're down on your face and your buttocks up in the air and then 4 on your right side, where you life your left leg up.\n\n It's a four ounce jelly?\n\n So, it's 4, 4, 4, 4.\n\n\r\nAnd when a person does that, a lot of people are in high anxiety and have depression, that relieves depression like that for sometimes weeks and months because the nervous system isn't getting- see the colon digests everything.\n\n \r\nIt goes to the nervous system and brain.\n\n So, if that doesn't get the fats, if your upper intestines, your small intestine, absorb everything.\n\n Your brain and nervous system don't get much down in the colon.\n\n So, when you feed it directly, the brain and nervous system get it all, all that fresh stuff.\n\n \r\nSo, a person is depressed, give 'em the high meat, they'll be silly and happy for a day, maybe two days, maybe a week, but they'll still go back into the depression faster when you put the cream and the fats, especially the dairy cream into the colon.\n\n You've got enough nutrients there for maybe two weeks, three weeks, one month to feed the nervous system.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI find the mercury formula, you don't get in constipation because of the pineapple.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends upon the individual.\n\n I asked everybody not to give their advice and opinions.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n I just wanted to know is it something that's good that has the pineapple somehow it works for me stomach wise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor some people it does, for some people it helps them have movements?\n\n\r\nYou have to experiment and see what things do for you and if it's consistent.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Crown \n \n \n \n \n### (11) Demerol \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, Demerol, that's conducive to brain cancer and pancreatic cancer\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Detox Formula, Food On Planes, Nitrates In Honey Set Off Alarm \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI went to Glen Ivy and I took your detoxification formula before I did\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe vegetable juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, the lime juice and the coconut cream?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nPenicillin formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's not, it pulls out industrial chemicals?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's the mango kiwi formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends upon the person?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOh.\n\n So, what was his detoxing formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLime juice and coconut cream?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat's it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, that was the main?\n\n \r\nBut what I wanted to continue was the only thing, the problem that I had, it seemed like  it affected my lungs that was the only discomfort that I had was that it was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you were throwing off metals through your lungs and the industrial chemicals outta your lungs.\n\n Other people, affects their livers or wherever they have the metals collecting and loose is where you'll feel it.\n\n So, yours are in the lungs.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nIf you get palpitation, is that what's going on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMetals in your heart?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIs that a Glen Ivy thing now.\n\n\r\nDon't they check your bags that you can't bring any glasswear anywhere?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's true?\n\n What I did was I brought plastic, and some ice water and that they let me take in, it was a plastic container of ice water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's bad cuz ice and plastic causes the phthalates to discharge.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, what could you do with that if there's new regulations.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I take my doctor's letter and I say I have to take my food in, unless you can provide that food?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, we need to get a another $100 for the letter.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you've got one for flying, use the same thing?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut it's only good for four months.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood for four months, yeah?\n\n \r\nAt Glen Ivy, they may take it once a year, but for flying, sometimes they'll say, \"Oh, you gotta have one fresh four months\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I actually had it worked once in Denver.\n\n When I was coming back to Denver, they actually accepted the letter.\n\n The first one when I went out in Burbank, for whatever reason that Whole Foods, for the celery, I guess the woman was wearing something or something, they swab and if it's positive in the swab and it was positive in the they went nuts.\n\n My luggage went through the x-ray, they double checked.\n\n They tore up my.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've had them do it to me too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat did they find that it went off.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey swabbed the-\r\n\n\r\nNitroglycerin, nitrates?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat's nitrates.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNitrates means that there may be nitroglycerin?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, what is in a nitrate.\n\n In milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Usually it'll be in honey or in manure.\n\n So, if you've gone to a farm, that's why when you get those things at the airport that says, have you've been on a farm.\n\n If you come in contact with animals, they want to know if you're gonna set the alarms off of the nitrates cuz of the nitrogen that's in there?\n\n And they use the nitrates and nitrogen to tell whether you've got nitrate, you've been exposed to nitroglycerin, and if you've been exposed to nitroglycerin, unless you have a heart condition.\n\n\r\nThey'll usually ask if you have a heart condition, but I said, \"No your machines are allergic to honey.\n\n There's lots of nitrogen in it\".\n\n \r\nSo, I clean, anytime I go on a plane with honey, the jar and the lids completely clean, spotless, and then I put the lid on tightly.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n⁠And the machine doesn't pick it up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBoy, if there's honey on the outside, can pick up the nitrates in it, they'll send the machine crazy?\n\n Then they'll tear everything apart, absolutely everything.\n\n They'll go through every compartment of my bag, they'll pull everything out.\n\n They'll go through absolutely.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe funny thing was the thing that really seem to upset him was my shaver, an electrical shaver.\n\n The electric shaver had high nitrate level, which it didn't seem to make any sense.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, do you eat honey at all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLots of it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n It's in your hair and as you cut the hair with your shaver, the nitrates are gonna be pulling in a lot.\n\n If you didn't eat honey, it wouldn't do that.\n\n Unless you were spreading manure on your beard then it would show up.\n\n I know people would do that *laughs*.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoes coconut cream have nitrates.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Not enough to detect anything.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWas was that remedy in the book.\n\n You said  the coconut cream and lime juice?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's in one of the newsletters for, oh, it's one of the newsletters?\n\n \r\nIf you have the PDFs in a file and then search there.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nUnder what.\n\n Industrial chemical?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, or lime juice and see every time lime juice pops up?\n\n \r\nThat way you'll learn what lime juice does in all of its context.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Eatign Schedule \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you start out in the morning, you should have some cheese first and then afterwards eggs\n\n And what is the current eating schedule.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSame thing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut start out with cheese cuz that's not in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlways cheese, yeah.\n\n\r\nFrom the book, that's different than I do now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's the difference now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEat cheese first thing in the morning, depends upon the individual?\n\n You have butter with it, if you have a tendency toward constipation.\n\n\r\nSo, let's say a guy your size.\n\n I'd say two tablespoons of cheese, teaspoon of butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFirst in the morning.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n First thing in the morning, next after that, to get the brain going, so you have a lot of sugar in your nervous system, so the brain functions and focuses properly?\n\n You need eggs, 2 to 3 eggs for your size.\n\n 5 - 10 minutes apart, between.\n\n 3 for your size.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n5 minutes apart.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n5 - 10 minutes apart?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then go into the regular schedule.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen go into your regular schedule.\n\n\r\nAnd then in between, throughout the day between the meat meal and your fruit meal, your sipping on the milk and sport formula and eating cheese periodically to absorb the poisons all day long.\n\n \r\nSo, the cheese is added and the sport formula is added.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nEarly in the morning, why do you have the cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo absorb all the poisons that havedumped into the stomach and intestines?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAnd what quantity of that, are we all sort the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll different?\n\n I would say for you, 2.\n\n5 tablespoons.\n\n or tables.\n\n I would also look at your toxicity?\n\n two and.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou told me only one tablespoon of cheese, I remember.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's different for you.\n\n I need your brain working faster.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nNow when you have your little bits of cheese in the middle of the night, you need a little bit of honey with it too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf I've given it to you as a mineral builder?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nNo, you didn't specify.\n\n\r\nSo, for the middle of the night, I had little cheese cubes, but I didn't know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid I give you a special diet.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid I tell you they have the cubes with honey or not.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI can't remember, I don't have any specific information on that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if I told you to have cubes, it's likely not honey with it, it's to absorb poisons.\n\n\r\nIf I say cubes, that means it's for detoxification.\n\n If I tell you to eat a tablespoon of cheese with a half a teaspoon of honey, that's what you have.\n\n If I said cubes, it's for poisons.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe cheese with the honey is for mineralization.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, to absorb and digest the minerals in the cheese?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Feel Good Getting Fat \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I guess that would be me too then, because as a teenager, I was a skinny kid\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I met you, you were already girthed.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou haven't gotten bigger, infact you've gotten a slimmer face.\n\n You're losing some of it and your arms your forearms, your wrists are smaller.\n\n\r\nI'm watching you over the years, I get to see you often, so I watch and I love that you always keep a big tummy.\n\n \r\nWhen I got that 47 inch waist, it was the best I ever felt and I'd never got up above 39\" before that.\n\n So, when I went from a 39\" to a 47\", I had never had to put my pants  under my tummy before, but I felt so good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n I was talking to Joseph, he's saw mine.\n\n I said, I've always had it.\n\n I always want this maternal feeling around.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, since I got those injections, I feel the pain, I feel nauseous.\n\n All that stuff I never used to feel- I felt after chemo.\n\n\r\nAnd when I got fat, that was the most relaxed I've ever felt since those injections.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Frozen Meat Damage, Honey & Lime & Lemon With Bone Marrow \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you know why sometimes bone marrow is more red as if it has more blood in it, and other times it has less, more white\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat particular area is generating a lot more red blood cells, normally you have a balance of red and white blood cells.\n\n See, that's where your red and white blood cells divide, mature, and then they enter the bloodstream.\n\n\r\nSo, that place where you have a lot of red is where the red blood cells are entering the bloodstream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that's good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's wonderful?\n\n Just more concentrated in red blood cells and not as much white blood cells in that area.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnother question on the bone marrow is I can't always get it fresh and so I know freezing things it reduces-\r\n\n\r\n80% of the value.\n\n\r\nIt's better to eat it rotten and stinking.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nChilean sea bass, they previously freeze if anybody gets it, that's what I found out.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nEverything is 80%.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverything?\n\n Well, protein could be more, but fats are 80% and bone marrow is predominantly fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEverybody gets frozen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow about refrigerating.\n\n Just refrigerating something?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLowers the bacteria levels considerably.\n\n That's why you put it room temperature to get the bacteria going again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd sometimes I mix a tiny bit of honey with it and it makes it taste so wonderful.\n\n Is that okay to put tiny bit of honey with it.\n\n Please say yes?\n\n**[mixing honey and bone marrow],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's risky because the honey will alter some of the protein, and it'll alter the stem cell effect.\n\n It'll just act like butter and honey and it's a heck of a waste of stem cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow about a tiny little drop of lemon or lime with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLime, no?\n\n Lemon would probably be okay.\n\n Lime is antibacterial, antimicrobial.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut it's okay to put on fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, lemon is, lemon incites bacterial implementation?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut he put some lime with the lemon on the fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's okay.\n\n It's better You don't put lime on any kind of meat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Gulping, How To Sip \n \n**[2013],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I have a tendency to gulp cause my mouth is so dry\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust gotta learn to only have a sip at a time.\n\n \r\nIf you're having, let's say a tablespoon a minute.\n\n You're 90 minutes, that's 90 tablespoons.\n\n That's 45 ounces.\n\n That's more than a quart.\n\n but don't bring a straw.\n\n \r\nYou take a straw, absolutely, if you like a straw, that's how I train myself to sip.\n\n I only drank through a straw for a while that way I couldn't drink, I couldn't gulp and I use a thin glass straw.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere would you find one.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI got it at a medical laboratory?\n\n They have different ones that are different sizes.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat happens to the body when you do gulp.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, any kind of fluid that you gulp, the H20 has a tendency to go to the kidney and is not carried with the nutrients to the cell?\n\n So, it causes dehydration.\n\n Especially if you drink it with cold fluids.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWell, I've better reduce the tablespoons, I have a wide glass straw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, then put your tongue up against it, so you have pressure, you have to get beyond the tongue.\n\n Put the straw on the tongue, so it makes the hole smaller.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou can just have a little spoon and just feed yourself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n But when you suck, you have all the enzymes, like in a baby, all the bacteria that comes out of the salivary glands.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Heartburn, Milkshakes \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI get heartburn a lot now, especially at night and in the morning and I never used to get that or maybe occasionally and all of a sudden I'm getting it almost daily\n\n How do I stop that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can't really?\n\n You've got acids and poisons that are dumping out from around the heart, all around the esophagus, into the esophagus.\n\n So, the only thing you can do to help it move out faster is to eat milkshakes, build lots of mucus so it can pour out the mucus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust sip on a milkshake through the day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll the time?\n\n Just make a couple of milkshakes and just all throughout the day keep sipping on them.\n\n\r\nThat's how much you need to bind with those poisons.\n\n Like these poisons I just couldn't handle anymore.\n\n So, that's why I went for 47\" waist.\n\n Felt the best I've felt since those injections three years ago.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo milkshakes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Build the mucus cuz those poisons are going through your esophagus, burning the esophagus lining.\n\n That's what heartburn is.\n\n So, if you have mucus there to absorb it and pull it out of your esophagus, you won't have so much burn.\n\n It's when the metals as are passing through, get locked cuz you don't have enough mucus.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Heat Sensitivity, Minimum Heat \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\n What would you recommend for somebody- because you remember Dave, right\n\n Dave, who had the consult with you when I did it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nHe's extremely sensitive to heat.\n\n Like his wife takes a bath, he can't put his hand in there.\n\n \r\nSo, how would you kind of get him up from not being able to take heat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPut hot water bottles under the covers?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Okay.\n\n He's doing that actually.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAnd as far as, would you recommend him doing like 98° or building it up to 105° or what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt won't do much much good?\n\n Better use the hot water bottles and heats the bed up at night.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAnd if someone did start doing the baths, could they start at 102° and do some good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\n102 is okay.\n\n But 102° would be absolute rock bottom minimum?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not gonna do anything at all under 102°?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) High Eggs \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh meat and high eggs\n\n Do you eat those on empty stomach and you kind of separate them or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI like to buy eggs and go buy meat?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a joke?\n\n Goodbye meat.\n\n You said hi eggs *laughs*.\n\n Keep everybody on their toes.\n\n\r\nNow, what did you ask about that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, should it be separated from every other thing that you eat or like on an empty stomach and nothing eaten afterwards?\n\n Or you can eat it with a regular meat meal or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can eat it with a regular meat meal?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou make your own high eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n He showed us how to do it.\n\n\r\nI got one that was black that was fantastic.\n\n Unbelievably good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou absorbed every bit of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, but the other ones, I can't get black.\n\n It happened like 1/6 or 7.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou gotta tap 'em a few times around.\n\n All the way around.\n\n You get it cracked all the way around and you put it near the sun where it stays warm.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I thought you said keep it in a cupboard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, not for that.\n\n Meat in a cupboard.\n\n Eggs, you have 'em in the carton and the sun can beat on the cart.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, they're covered out of the sunlight, but in the heat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow long does it take.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on the individual?\n\n I've had some up to a year and three months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not bad, a little bit acidic.\n\n A little bit sharp.\n\n I did dig everything out of it too, because it kind of gets stuck.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd it makes you feel good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah?\n\n Well, it feeds your brain and nervous system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe other ones are okay that that aren't black.\n\n the black ones are great.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat does it make you feel after you've eaten the high egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo much energy it's ridiculous?\n\n Kind like the high meat does a little bit.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow often do you eat it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOnce a week?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've got people who only do high meat and only do high eggs.\n\n They don't eat anything fresh.\n\n These people are the funniest, happiest people in the world.\n\n \r\nYou can't overdo it.\n\n\r\nWell, let me put it this way.\n\n I know a fellow who eats two pounds a day of high meat, and he's the greatest person I know.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Honey and Butter, Hormones For Physical Activity \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, basically I've been working on my health all my life and I also teach body meditation\n\n I do a lot of body meditation.\n\n That's how I got my health back from being dead for a year and a half in 1995.\n\n So, I built my body back slowly, but none of the things that were advised to me worked through meditation, but as my energy coming in stronger and stronger.\n\n I'm getting jittery.\n\n And it was like, so I started looking around for doctors again and, and all the, ideas that were given to me were going, wow, that's hard to do.\n\n So, then I come up with, don't eat sugar, don't eat fat, don't do this, don't do that.\n\n\r\nBy the time you get through and with all the food allergies, it's like, okay, might as well go back to meditating.\n\n So, anyway, I got your book about two days ago.\n\n I won't go into how I got it, but I got it.\n\n I'm not supposed to have fat honey.\n\n I'm not supposed to have anything sweet, I'm not supposed to have anything fat.\n\n\r\nSo, I thought, okay, well I'm gonna try this in meditation.\n\n I'm gonna try the unheated honey the raw butter.\n\n All of which I had at my house because I was dying for those things.\n\n So, I made that mixture, and every half hour I would try it and you were talking about somebody in a coma.\n\n I don't know who.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMy son.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And so I tried it and, and I went this feels kind of sore the first time cuz I had this philosophical thing and then by the second or third time I thought, no, this feels kind of good.\n\n And so I'm gonna take for maybe three or four hours.\n\n At the end I thought, no, this is working.\n\n This is okay for me.\n\n I went, wow, I can have some fat and sugar.\n\n This is like the most thrilling thing I can.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n But here is not sugar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know, sweet.\n\n \r\nSo, then I tried the eggs.\n\n Well, I'm allergic eggs.\n\n I tried the egg, tomatoes, that's the trouble of being so educated in quotes, so tomatoes aren't good for eggs.\n\n They're supposed to be lectins that aren't good for you.\n\n And I thought, well, I have the tomatoes, I have the eggs, I have everything here, let me try this one.\n\n \r\nSo, I tried it, and of course I don't have the exact ingredients right, but that felt kind of good too.\n\n\r\nThen my boyfriend said, \"That is way too rich\", and I thought it feels good.\n\n I mean, I put a little more tomato and a little less fat.\n\n So, I guess the way you're shaking your head, tomato is okay, it's not a lectin for a type A.\n\n You don't feel that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, and then allergic to eggs, you know that whole thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's cooked.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCooked eggs, right.\n\n That was my question though is in that discussion right there about the tomatoes and that's all I know really is that, but the jitteriness that's been going on really forever, and I think it's because when I was very young, I had the world's worst acne, don't know why, but they then x-rayed the face for that and then they don't put anything over your throat?\n\n So, then you have thyroid.\n\n\r\nAnd so I don't know if every time I do something good, I get jittery because there's some things unresolved or what you're talking about, toxicity.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're way off balance, like look at your hands and your skin.\n\n You're a high adrenaline, estrogen and testosterone individual.\n\n You create a lot of hormones for physical activity.\n\n If you don't utilize that physical activity and physical expression, you're gonna have to put it out in emotional expression.\n\n You will be jittery.\n\n \r\nSo, when you get on this diet, you get the raw cream and the nerve starts settling down and you exercise enough, you won't be jittering.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou don't mean like tai chi, that kind of exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of exercise you enjoy: dancing, singing, singingis the most strenuous?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI get in these blockades where there's really not a choice.\n\n Like I have one hip, cuz I was born with two shallow hips.\n\n So, a lot of exercise, not particularly good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat did I just say.\n\n Singing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, singing.\n\n I didn't hear that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n20 minutes of singing is an hour on a treadmill.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what I'm thinking is that I'm going get your book of recipes, I bought your DVD.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhich DVD.\n\n The recipe or the workshop?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe workshop?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's a recipe DVD.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then I thought I work with it a little bit, see how I do, so I'm appointed with it.\n\n And then come and see you and you can fine tune.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou know, that's kind of my idea.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood idea.\n\n You're doing good.\n\n Always explore and experiment first and you find out the truth.\n\n\r\nGet out of your head with that stuff.\n\n Everything you've learned is wrong.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor me, apparently.\n\n \r\nSo, this testosterone, do you mind to say just a little bit more about what you just said about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, certain people create a lot of hormones for physical activity, and you can tell by that by the activity rings?\n\n\r\nMost iridologists call them stress rings.\n\n They're only stress rings if people don't exercise, don't utilize those hormones for physical activity.\n\n If you don't utilize them, spend them in physical activity, you will spend them in anxiety.\n\n That causes ticks, nervousness, anxiety of all sorts.\n\n\r\nAnd I can't tell without photographing your eyes, see how many activity rings you have, but I can tell by your skin, you have high activity hormones in your skin, means your whole life.\n\n And everybody who has 'em, there's no change in their life, if they've been debilitated, you don't get the joy of utilizing your physical hormones for physical expression.\n\n\r\nYou're utilizing it on your bad health, because hormones are 60% - 80% fat.\n\n The body will use 'em for chelating with poisons if you don't eat enough fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd I haven't eaten any fat since 1995 basically.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell that's cause you didn't have raw butter than honey unheated.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI had each of those things, but I had never tried them together.\n\n \r\nSo, what about cheese.\n\n I think I can't possibly eat cheese?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n Cheese and honey.\n\n Stabilize your nerves.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou get unsalted raw cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Has to be unsalted raw cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI got your PDF about where you can get that.\n\n Probably Whole Foods,.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n Just have to mail away for it.\n\n I think Organic pastures makes a no salt raw cheese.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo, only hardly anymore.\n\n Most of the ones that I've seen the last couple of years is all slightly salted.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're not ordering it.\n\n You have to ask them to order it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) How Many Sports Drinks \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo I suck\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat's the maximum number of sports drinks during the bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't think there's a limit?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou can have as many as you want.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n But as long as you're sipping it.\n\n Let's say you sip a table spoon every minute you're in there for 90 minutes, that's 45 ounces.\n\n That's a quart and a half of fluid.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWell, I've been gulping.\n\n I go through two quarts easy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, you're pissing out probably too much.\n\n You're probably pissing out 2/3 of it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nAnd I'm drinking three times as much *laughs*.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nEating cheese in between the sports formula, you gotta wait 10 minutes from the cheese to get the sports formula.\n\n Every 20 minutes in the bath, you said to take a piece of cheese.\n\n So, it's a very little time you have any time to finish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell then do two tablespoons a minute.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOf what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOf the sport formula?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut don't use a straw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Why would you not drink it through the straw.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBecause you're getting the two tablespoons, you're measuring it?\n\n You know exactly how much you could take.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Put a tablespoon of fluid in your mouth and see what it feels like.\n\n Get a sense of how much volume in your mouth the tablespoon is.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWe could just dispense with the cheese while in the bath, couldn't we.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a good idea, even if you're not waiting to have some cheese, just to make sure have cheese in the bath because you're gonna be throwing up toxins in that hot bath?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n Because I wouldn't take it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI do absolutely do while I'm in that bathtub.\n\n Poisons are gonna come out galore.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nBecause I can't wait 10 minutes after the cheese while I'm in the bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's okay.\n\n Jst drink on top of four minutes later, five minutes later, whatever it is.\n\n Can only do that while you're in the bath.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWait a minute, you take the cheese and don't you have to wait 10 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen you're in the bath, the laws can change.\n\n The rules can change.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) How Much Fat Daily. Hydrochloric Aicd, Betts &pineapple \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nOne that I've been experiencing the heart fibrillations and sort of the achy joints, and I dunno if that's part of my rheumatoid arthritis\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd then I wanted to ask you about what quantity of fat should I be eating of each kind of: how much coconut cream, how much milk, how much of the different things should I be eating daily.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecause maybe I'm not, I feel like I'm eating a lot of fat and maybe I should be eating more?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou are one of the dryer individuals that I've had, but you're doing better?\n\n You're doing pretty good.\n\n So, it all depends on how well you digest, how much bile you produce.\n\n Your skin looks good.\n\n I can see the red blood cells; I can see the enzymes.\n\n Probably doing as fast as you can, as you get better and eating pineapple will help that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nMore than just with the fruit meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, just the fruit meal?\n\n Well, if you want to you could have a chunk with a meat meal.\n\n Maybe no more than an 1\" x 1\" cube.\n\n Eat that with your meat, that would help your digestion a little bit more overall.\n\n Might help you digest your fat, a little bit better, beet juice.\n\n Are you doing that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't do beet juice?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay, then put some beet in your juice.\n\n Beets highest in chlorine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAre you talking about the green vegetable juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat quantity do I add to that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAbout 10% of your juice could be beet juice for about 14 days, and after that, drop it down to 5%, unless it works for you to stay on the 10%?\n\n \r\n\r\nBeet juice is high in chlorine.\n\n The highest food in chlorine, natural chlorine, not chemical chlorine, chloride.\n\n Chlorine is predominant in hydrochloric acid, so it helps build hydrochloric acid.\n\n Hydrochloric acid helps better digestion, also helps the liver make better bile, the pineapple does that too.\n\n Pineapple helps both.\n\n Both pineapple and beets help digestion both in the liver and with the hydrochloric acids in the stomach.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if I'm adding 10% of the beet the juice mixture, what am I taking away.\n\n Less celery?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLess a little of everything?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay, so then in terms of the quantity of fat, like that I should be eating daily for either drinking milk, coconut or cream, butter, dairy cream, cheese, avocado.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI'd say you're doing pretty well.\n\n Are you nervous or anxiety or depressed at all.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI'd say you've got good balance.\n\n Okay.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you want more fat, just push everything equally.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd what about the achy with my joints that just sort of comes and goes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, that's when you have poisons not coming through your skin, and so you're throwing out poisons out the joints?\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, the sport formula, you sip on that throughout the day, that's going to help neutralize those poisons coming out the joints.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n And that also in addition to the bath or those two separate things.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, bath helps get to that stuff faster out the skin, so it doesn't hang up in the joints?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nMilk.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOne of the things it's doing is building mucus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOnly when it's involved in a milkshake?\n\n When you have milk with egg and extra cream and honey, you're gonna build a lot of mucus.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you have it by itself, what's it do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's just going to take care of everything evenly?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, as a milkshake with cream, milk, egg and honey.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, if I add ginger juice to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's going to thin the mucus?\n\n It won't stop creating mucus.\n\n, it'll be thinner mucus.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat does that mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt means, let's say you got really thick mucus and you can't cough it out, or it comes out in a thick glob, you want to thin it a little bit?\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (23) How Much Fibre \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEven if it's done separately from your eggs\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't make any difference if particles lag in the folds of the intestines?\n\n \r\nAlways juicing, but you look like you don't need much juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI don't juice at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just don't need much cuz you're over alkaline right now.\n\n \r\nMaybe in six weeks, seven weeks, you can start having a little juice.\n\n But you need to get unalkalinized.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCream, milk, butter, eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Meat.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDid you say the Vitamix is too much fiber.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n In order to eat the fiber, you have to have alkalinizing enzymes and bacteria and we're acidic.\n\n \r\nSo, everything's acidic, you're not gonna digest properly.\n\n If your body's gone to the point of making enzymes, and digestive juices for alkalizing material.\n\n\r\nBetween a rock and a hard place, and you're not gonna do just either very well.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Keep Your Fat, Aajonus Built Pool, Etc \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nDo you recommend in the summertime be going off, like going down, in the wintertime going up\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's up to you?\n\n I say get your fat and keep it, don't get rid of it.\n\n But you know, I I go to Asia, I start doing actual physical stuff.\n\n Like I just got a swimming pool, I built a swimming pool, it's a shape of a mango and I have different levels on it.\n\n So, you can weigh in it, the deepest is 9 foot and I've got a diving board to dive into it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThere's a stream where I put a dam in so it goes down and I had designed, they built it, a waterfall and I had all these mechanical things made for jets to run a Pelton wheel and I got a generator that's being made right now to create power.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, just with filling up my swimming pool that goes down into a fish pond and that goes into another fish pond, so I use all of that water multiple times.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI have no filter on the swimming pool, so it's great algae, but because there's always new water flushing in, it doesn't get so green you can't see down in there.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut still green, full of algae and algae eats metals.\n\n So, algae gets into the skin, eats the metals, and pulls em out.\n\n So, that's why I had that and eight days ago I was there swimming in my swimming pool for the first time.\n\n It was really good.\n\n Algae is wonderful.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about drinking algae.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWonderful?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the form of algae to drink.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, algae isn't alive?\n\n It's just gonna pass through you like vegetable fiber.\n\n You're always thinking ahead, wait until I finish my sentence so everybody gets it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo algae, if you're eating it in powder form, is not going to be digested.\n\n Every time I check the feces of people who ate it, I always found 98% of it in the feces, only 2% seemed to be absorbed or was hiding in the feces where I couldn't detect it.\n\n Because when you test like that, you have to dissolve the feces in water, and then you have to, then you have to use something to separate the algae from it, a certain kind of filter, like a thousand micrometers to get whatever you want out of it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, it's like mining for gold.\n\n It's stinking and messy, and you have to do it by hand.\n\n So, I always found 98%, it could have been 100%, but at the best it's 98%.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut in chlorella, I found 7% was not found in the feces.\n\n So, what that means is if you're only eating a fraction, only have a little bit of chlorella.\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't have a teaspoon of it or something like that, have just a tiny amount, size of the bb.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI just said, cause you won't just absorb it?\n\n Otherwise, it's waste, expensive waste.\n\n And when it's in dry form like that, you're not going to digest it anyway, so put it in your vegetable juice.\n\n When you make your vegetable juice, put a little bit in each vegetable juice, can it and let it sit.\n\n When you get to it, it will already be liquid.\n\n So, when you put it in the body, you'll be able to start breaking it down.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen it's dry, the kind of bacteria we have: we're not cows, we're not pigs, we're not horses, we're not goats or sheep.\n\n They have the enzymes, which are highly fluid and they'll go into dried vegetation and break it down, we don't do that.\n\n That's why we don't handle vegetation raw.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, you drink vegetable juice.\n\n So, when you hydrate that chlorella, it's already starting to come alive again and the bacteria eats live things in our bodies.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (25) Metal Attract Radiation .lexane and Metal Water Bottles, Tell People Youre Allergic \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nStoring food and stainless steel\n\n Yes?\n\n No?\n\n**[2013],[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nStoring food and stainless steel?\n\n Yes?\n\n No?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou attract a lot of radiation to metal, not a good idea?\n\n Use glass.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean you track a lot of radiation to metal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, what do you use as antennas?\n\n Metal is an antenna for any kind of radio waves, wifi waves, you name it?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n Cause the food's in the metal and then it attracts radiation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt attracts the radiation and just broadcasts right to your food.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, well, glass has a liability of breaking, so someone gave me some un stainless steel bottles for water and I thought, you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBut not a good idea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about the metal tops on the glass jars.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe food's not touching it and it's not going to broadcast through, unless you fill it to the top?\n\n You're doing that with vegetable juice, but you've also gotten a refrigerator and the walls are blocking.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you're carrying around a metal container with your fluid in it, you're getting it into your body and into your hand going up all through your body, in the food, and then you're drinking it, just adding all that radiation to the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you wanted something that was non unbreakable, a container to carry a liquid drink in, what would you use.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLexane?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't like it?\n\n If it gets hot, if the sun hits it, the phthalates are gonna move into it, so you have to keep it out of the sun.\n\n You can't let it get too high, can't let it get over 102°.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you're in a car or anything, so then you just have glass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, why would you be wanting.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I'm thinking, I take glass with me when I go to play tennis?\n\n You're not allowed to, but I do it anyway.\n\n But I was just sort of thinking, sometimes I'll go someplace and I want to put something in my pocket I could take with me and so I'm just looking for, because you asked a question, was there another choice of something that was okay in an emergency.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, if you wanna play tennis, make sure you got it in a thing where the sun-  \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I bring these glass jars.\n\n But I'm not supposed that, people call me on it and I'm like, well, this is what I'm doing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nJust tell 'em you're allergic to plastic and you're allergic to metal and plastic, you can't use anything else on.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat'll shut 'em up fast.\n\n Anytime a person gives you hassle, say, \"I'm allergic to it, you want me to be sick.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nYou're not allowed to go on planes with any glass?\n\n As far as I know.\n\n It can only be like three ounces.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI take four quarts with me because of the doctor's letter.\n\n And then you got a doctor's letter from me, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n I don't have one, I haven't flown in a while.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (26) Mucus From Milkshakes, Sweating Toxins \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nIf it's too thick to bring up, it's not good\n\n You need to thin it a little bit with some ginger.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you eat the ginger or does it have to be juiced.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou can grate it in the milkshake and blend it in the milkshake?\n\n That's the best way to do it if you want to thin the mucus.\n\n \r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's just gonna go in your stomach lining and irritate.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, milkshakes are a good way to protect the lungs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Just remember all of your mucus membranes have to have mucus.\n\n The way I always tell people, you ever try having sex with that mucus down there.\n\n You're gonna be raw and red and sore and abrased?\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you eat foods and you have no mucus lining it, you breathe and you got dust in the air, you don't have the mucus to keep the dust or pollen, wherever it is from going into your mucus membranes into the tissue, you're gonna have problems, you're gonna have allergies.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you need mucus, not just for the lungs, but all areas.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEverywhere inside the body?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, are there any other things other than milkshakes to produce healthy mucus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's the only one, only one that I found?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd to detox the lungs you've got that egg and orange juice formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, that helps?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIs there anything else that helps detox lungs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I have egg?\n\n It's an orange Julius, so it's cream, egg and orange and it isn't orange juice.\n\n It's taking an orange and blending it, not the rind of course.\n\n And you blend it with milk, egg, honey, and cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat will that do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHelp the lungs detoxify?\n\n That's the orange Julius in my book.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThat would be your fruit meat during the day then and never more than that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDrink that well once a day?\n\n I wouldn't have more fruit than that, unless you have pneumonia, then you could have one milkshake and two smoothies, Orange Julius smoothies.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo that proportion of the milk Julian is one egg, one orange.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends upon the person?\n\n \r\n\r\nI give a ballpark figure in the book.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhich is what book.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe Recipe Book?\n\n If I were going do it per an individual, it depends upon how dry the skin is, I would go for a little bit more cream.\n\n If the skin is terribly dry and you're bleeding in your nose and your mucus, then I would add a tiny bit of butter along with it into that orange julius.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I would make the orange no more than 1/3 of the whole mixture.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's good for gums.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCheese and honey?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I have real problem with cheese, it's very constipated for me, any cheese.\n\n I used to drink whey and I stopped doing that cuz it's so constipating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou're just gonna have to do suppositories and you were almost as dry as she was when I first met you and I just think your body is still starving for fats in your colon.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, suppository I think is the only way you're gonna do it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd if you've done the suppository and the mixture of cream butter and coconut cream doesn't work for you, get rid of the coconut cream and just use more of the dairy cream and the normal amount of butter.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, use three tablespoons of dairy cream and tablespoons of butter, and that 1/4 teaspoon of honey, leave out the coconut cream.\n\n That way you won't be detoxing with a coconut cream, you'll only be strengthening and building your intestinal tract, your bowel.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you get constipated and you don't have a block in your intestines, if you don't have severe pain along with it, you don't have a blockage.\n\n That means you don't have a collapsed colon.\n\n That means your body's absorbing so much of everything that you eat, it's not getting enough fats in the colon to be satisfied, so it's just holding on your feces too long, pulling out everything.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you have a bowel movement every 24 hours and it's getting that dry, that's a sign that you've got good digestion and just not enough proper kind of fats in your colon.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, try that for this next time until I come back in July and let me know and how it goes.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nI tried on the rash I had on my legs a trip to Glen Ivy and your facial cream, it worked.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nGood.\n\n See, I told you, you just need to get the poisons out of the body with the heat first, then the poisons out, when they're locked in the skin, they're gonna keep doing damage to the skin, cuz they're locking up under the connective tissue underneath the skin and passing through the skin a little at a time and it abraises the tissue.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you get into the the hot bath, like at Glen Ivy and you spend the day in there, you've got like 5, 7, 8 hours in there where you're constantly perspiring those poisons out.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNow, the next wave that comes under the skin again, if another wave does come, you need to do the same thing again.\n\n Cuz those poisons are either coming from your muscles or your bones and it has to get to the skin again under the skin, and then it has to pass through the skin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, if you move it fast with long, long high baths, and then put the Primal facial body care cream on top, you strengthen those cells while they're clean, make it to absorb everything.\n\n But if the poisons are locked in the skin, the poisons have a tendency to hold onto the fat.\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n \r\n\r\nCould you divert it by eating cheese and divert it to the stomach, instead of the skin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nin the legs it's hard to do?\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's too far away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot too far away?\n\n It just doesn't happen very often.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's the problem I have.\n\n I eat a lot of cheese trying to get it out from my legs, stop all the bursting of my flesh here, but not my legs.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nCoating the rash with cheese did help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, that drew it out.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat did you do.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nI had a rash on my legs, I put cheese on it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAlkalizing minerals to pull it out.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat was the last thing I suggested for him to help.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you have the honey with your cheese, it's to digest the cheese.\n\n You don't digest cheese that's no salt, raw cheese, there's no enzymes in it.\n\n Your body's just gonna absorb poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, to absorb, and to get your concentrated minerals.\n\n You mix a slight bit of honey with the cheese.\n\n It's like 1/3 honey - 2/3 cheese, so it's, it's 3 tablespoons of cheese, would be 3 teaspoons of honey.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI even do less.\n\n If I'm having three tablespoons of cheese, I only have 1.\n\n5 - 2 teaspoons of honey to digest my cheese.\n\n And then you get all this mineral concentration to help the nerves and the whole system and I have to eat a lot because of all the mineral loss from those poisons in my body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAbout thinning mucus again, I read in your book about horse radish and lemon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but they can really cause irritation, so much mucus loss.\n\n They rip the mucus off the intestinal linings.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat horse radish should be used in very small amounts and lemon demineralizes the body too much.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (27) No Walk Required After Bath \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd what about the walk at the end that you had in the book\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't have to do that anymore?\n\n \r\nMost people can't do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's still good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it'll be wonderful thing if you can do it?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nIt's only because people can't do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, not because it isn't better not to do it?\n\n \r\nBut there's an advantage if you don't do it too, cuz then you get right under the covers and you stay warm the whole night.\n\n So, you're gonna be perspiring more, of course if you're walking hard, but then you're gonna be using your nutrients to deal with the lactic acid that's building up in your exercise.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCould you rebound.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can rebound it?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat happens with lactic acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you have lactic acid, your body has to use a lot of minerals to neutralize that, change it over?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Novocane \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd what about the Novocain stuff for dental\n\n What kind of mixtures can you assist to get rid of that toxic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's injected deep into the bone structure here, so the body will not circulate when that stuff's injected that's why it causes so much cancer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you mean by it won't circulate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't, they stab it right in near the bone?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThen how do you get rid of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA lot of eggs, a lot of heat around the face?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWould the pulling help in them.\n\n Coconut cream and coconut oil pulling?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt will definitely help, that will definitely help.\n\n \r\nYou can pull with anything.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou need to do that on an empty stomach, you said, right.\n\n \r\nYou do that the first thing in the morning?\n\n\r\nHave some cheese beforehand?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI pull with cheese?\n\n\r\nI get the cheese and just keep it so I know it's locked in there and I'll spit it out after about five minutes, then I'll down an egg or down just a little cheese, and then I down an egg or two after that and then go back to the cheese pulling.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Organic Cotton \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou don't want to be in the room when they're on\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDid you say that your handkerchief is organic cotton.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, they have to be organic in order to buy it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Well, you want to.\n\n I would buy organic cotton.\n\n You're gonna be breathing these particles.\n\n I want it to be organic cotton.\n\n I don't want Monsanto.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nDo they have it online.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n You can get organic cotton many places.\n\n**[Kathy],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nhandkerchief \r\n\n\r\nJust go get a piece of cloth.\n\n You go to a material store and get some organic cloth and just cut a section and roll it up like this.\n\n And if you have a sewing machine, bind the edges so it doesn't fray.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Oxidized Cholsterol, Ozonation, Ionization Machine \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOxidized cholesterol, is the only way it come would be from cooking\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can oxidize by ozonating?\n\n You can oxidize by cooking food, eating cooked food, smoke, inhaling chemicals.\n\n Many ways to oxidize.\n\n\r\nMany ways to ruin the oxygen in your body.\n\n\r\nA lot of people ozonated and you know, you eat ozonated olive oil and stuff like that, you're just robbing yourself of oxygen.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nEven those ozone machines in the room.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't use an ozone machine in a room while you're in it and breathing?\n\n You can do it ionizing machines and ozonation machines in a room you're not in.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Pain From Dental Surgery, Novacane \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you don't really need anything\n\n If you want to, you could take some ice and put it on there, that's about the best thing to numb it if you want to do that.\n\n But because he has the waters jet, the bit doesn't get hot.\n\n \r\nWhen I had all of my amalgams removed, I had 16 teeth that had amalgams in it, so I had removed 8 one day and 8 the next day.\n\n It was four hours of drilling each day and there was no water jet in those days.\n\n So, that bit would get real hot, it would burn the nerve, so I had a signal, I'd tap his elbow or something to get him to stop, cool the bit and then go back in.\n\n\r\nBut I didn't use any Novocain, anything for that.\n\n It's pretty traumatic, but when you don't use an anesthetic, the pain's gone in about 6 - 7 hours, 12 hours maximum.\n\n If you get any kind of anesthetic, Novocain, Xylocaine, any of them, it causes swelling for months in that tooth and surrounding area.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's a direct correlation between Xylocaine and breast cancer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd also heart attacks.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nFrom what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFrom dental anesthetic?\n\n More people, when they're seeing a physician, get a heart attack from dental work, from anesthetic.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHow do you remove the anesthetic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt takes years and years and years and years and years?\n\n For one injection, it takes about 6 years to get rid of all the poisons cause it's injected and goes into the bone and the hardened tissue, it's hard to get rid of.\n\n \r\nIt's responsible for almost all mouth cancer.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo Novocains are the cause.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNovocain, Xylocaine, all of them?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about Demerol.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, Demerol, that's conducive to brain cancer and pancreatic cancer?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHow do you handle the pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's why I like this dentist?\n\n He's so gentle, he's slow, I took Jeff Slay a couple of months ago to him, and he had cavities between two of his molars.\n\n So, he had to drill down in both tooth teeth, good part of the tooth as well right down to the nerve.\n\n Even bled and Jeff didn't feel the thing.\n\n No, Novocains, didn't feel anything.\n\n\r\nHe nicked Jeff's nerve, he said he barely felt it cuz the water jet is cool.\n\n It cools the area and keeps the nerve contracted, when it expands and swells, that's when you have pain.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, what about when you get crowns installed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're not hitting a nerve if you're getting a crown?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nNo, I'm talking about, like a crowns a good idea because you have to glue to the tooth, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when I had those teeth done, I had to have five caps on them, cuz there was so much tooth gone?\n\n And when they popped out, I took beeswax and I took a round edge of the spoon and I pressed them on a plate and I put that inside just so it fit in just fine fit inside the cap, put it on and I bit down on each one of them.\n\n When I went back to have them removed, he couldn't remove them.\n\n And the ones that had been put on with glue popped right off.\n\n But the ones that I had put on with beeswax, he couldn't get them off.\n\n He worked for one hour just getting one of them off.\n\n**[Attendee #3],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, you can have them put with- \r\n\n\r\nHe won't do it.\n\n A dentist won't do that.\n\n But that's what I did when they popped out.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhy didn't you just leave it on then if it was so hard to get off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe metal, the chip, it was like 25 years old, 20, 25 years old, so all of the porcelain had chipped off of the metal and I could taste the metal, so I didn't want that contamination in my mouth 24 hours a day?\n\n Well, boy, that one was a really hard one.\n\n That was the first one I put on with beeswax.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhen you do have even a plastic crown infused to high noble metal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n I've used a porcelain on a cap, I wouldn't use plastic on a cap.\n\n Just in a filling.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, a crowns need to be porcelain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, when you have pure porcelain, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what they do is they have pure porcelain, they want to take most of your tooth away?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying that then if you're gonna have a crown, it's best to have porcelain infused to high noble metal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo gold?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, that's the best thing.\n\n Why.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause gold doesn't deteriorate as easily and you don't have to get rid of much as much tooth?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nThe thing is, you are saying that it can be infused to pure gold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no, no?\n\n Pure gold is too soft, but it's completely covered by porcelain.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, it's basically, high noble metal is a mixture of gold, tin, aluminum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, tin they can't use.\n\n Tins is highly poisonous.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, it's aluminum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAluminum, some type of stainless steel and gold?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, then that's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nThat metal is not going directly on the gums.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShouldn't if it's a good crown.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nAnd so what was the reason not to have pure porcelain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause they have to take so much tooth away, they crack and chip very easily?\n\n Porcelain is not strong.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nBut you're saying it's not toxic to the body to have porcelain infused to high noble metal.\n\n It's not toxic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou've got enough porcelain over it?\n\n Over the metal.\n\n But if it started liking mine would start chipping away, then my metal was exposed.\n\n My acids in my mouth, cuz they're much higher cause I had the vagotomy.\n\n So, the acids that used to be in my stomach are in my mouth.\n\n\r\nThat's when my teeth just deteriorate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat did you call that.\n\n You had a vagotomy?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVagotomy pyeloplasty on my stomach when I was 20?\n\n\r\nYou have all these vagus nerves that are attached to the stomach and that helps generate hydrochloric acid into the stomach All of mine were severed at 20 years old in that stomach surgery, so a lot of my acids back up into the mouth.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nYou could taste that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah?\n\n But it's not good for the teeth, eats away at the teeth.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, what did you have to have done.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI just have to rinse my mouth with milk after I eat and stuff like that to make sure acids don't build up?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Pemmican and Dried Food, Sparkling Water For Cleach & Hydrogren Peroxide \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why the Eskimos, even though they make pemmican every year, dried meat with fat, they'll make a 90-pound block of it for each person in case they can't find food in the winter, just in case\n\n And when that spring comes around, if they haven't eaten it, they bury it.\n\n They won't eat it, enzyme deficient.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf the enzymes are deficient, you're not gonna digest your vitamins as well, you're not gonna digest everything as well.\n\n So, your health is going to decrease, Eskimos won't do it.\n\n They'll bury it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, how do you get fresh chlorella.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you can do it right your yard?\n\n Don't put it where the chemtrails can dump into it, but just have a bowl of good drinking water and if you've got Gerolsteiner, shake all the carbon out of it cuz the carbonation will destroy anything.\n\n It's like a natural hydrogen peroxide.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt can bleach, you can take the Gerolsteiner or Perrier or any of them and put in an old blood stain, pull it right out?\n\n Even an old blood stain.\n\n But if you leave it on, it'll also start taking the dye out of your clothes or your furniture, whatever it is.\n\n It's a natural form of hydrogen peroxide.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you use that, it won't let the algae grow.\n\n So, just let some water sit, just let us start.\n\n You can take up a little bit of vegetable juice, put a few drops in it, that'll help.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nCould you put it under an umbrella.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat would help?\n\n Just remember, algae eat rock, so you have to put rocks in with the water or you have to make some kind of the clay vessel where algae can eat away at the metal, you don't want any glaze on it.\n\n Concrete, you can use a concrete that doesn't have excessive lye in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about just a glass of water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat will never turn to algae?\n\n Algae eats rock.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat kind of a rock.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI just said: clay, concrete, porcelain, but if it's porcelain, it can't be glazed, fired, any of those, but you're not gonna get as much algae growing in porcelain cuz there's not a lot of metals in?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nI ordered the chlorella from out of state, but it's not good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat did I just say to do with chlorella that's dried.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nOh?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nPut it in your vegetable juice, just a pinch.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nHalf a teaspoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's too much, you'll never digest that much.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWell then how much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nMaybe 1/8 teaspoon per 8 ounces of vegetable juice?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd you just stir it in and you drink it the next day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOr days later?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen you make vegetable juice for how many days do you make.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThree days?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Some of them will be three days old.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nOnly put it in one then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, you put it all of them, but you're just putting a small amount?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd then you mix it in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (33) Pineapple Mixture 5-6 Before Bath \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDoing the pineapple, but my question would be, can you give us an update on changes in the baths since you wrote the book\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBefore I used to say drink that pineapple mixture right before you get in the bath or while you're in there, when you first get in?\n\n I find that that isn't efficient over the years for a lot of people.\n\n \r\nSo, I found that if you eat it at your normal fruit meal, it's gonna be in your blood and in your digestive tract being absorbed by the time you get into the tub at night.\n\n  \r\nSo, I used to want the fresh juices activated, but I find that those aren't as good as when it's getting into the mixing and all in the blood and in the digestive tract with other nutrients and when it's bacterial assimilated, and worked on better with the bacteria in the intestines.\n\n  \r\nSo, I found that eating the pineapple mixture for your regular fruit meal and doing the baths at night is better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat if you take your bath before your fruit meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot such a good idea, but if you do, then you eat your fruit meal at a different time of the day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI mean, a lot of times I'll get up in the morning and after I've had my green juice, I'll decide I just want to take my bath and be done with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, then I would eat your fruit meal in the middle of the night.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat far ahead of time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n I find 5 - 6 hours minimum is better.\n\n \r\n8 -9 hours is good too.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Porcelain Wont Leach \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n If you have metal in your mouth, like from high noble metal in the crowns, in the pulling, does it pull any of the metals\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour metal isn't exposed?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAlright.\n\n I don't know.\n\n That's why I'm trying to get the information.\n\n \r\nSo, you can do the mouth pulling safe if you've got those crowns of high noble metal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, can't get through the porcelain?\n\n Only if it's liquid and the metal's not liquid.\n\n It's solid and the porcelain is solid.\n\n Now, there may be some metal in the porcelain, but they're not allowed to use lead in that and they use aluminum and like I say, trace amount in the ear, your body can handle that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Primal Facial Body Care Cream, Royal Jelly Frozen \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCatch what the change was\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe skin Formula one?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, the skin formula?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe Primal Facial Body Care Cream is the same.\n\n It is the same.\n\n \r\nWell, you can alter it instead of putting butter in it, you can put bone marrow.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat would that do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it just adds stem cells to the skin and that would be better for you?\n\n Put bone marrow in your Primal Facial Body Care Cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat royal jelly, would that add stem cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can't get it unfrozen anymore?\n\n\r\nFreezing destroys the stem cells.\n\n You cannot get royal jelly unfrozen.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt's no good to eat the Royal Jelly anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's no good anymore?\n\n They freeze all of it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Raw Milk Lawsuit \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat was such a great win\n\n That was a whole state and in that situation, they didn't have the little county DA there, they had the DOJ Attorneys, Department of Justice of Wisconsin down there in this little town.\n\n They're a farm town.\n\n \r\nAfter I got off the stand, they had a federal one, they had a FDA attorney, flew in for it.\n\n And I went up to him, and I said, \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself\".\n\n Just like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe don't speak up though, we never get what we want.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't speak up, you're not going to be heard.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Tincpoisonous, Aluminum In Fillings \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, aluminum, some of 'em used to use tin, but tin's highly poisonous\n\n So, they went to aluminum, cuz it's lighter and as strong, but not poisonous.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes it go in the body at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot enough to ever detect a trace?\n\n If you collected the amount of toxins that were released from the composite filling, it would take a year to get a trace, collect a trace.\n\n\r\nNot enough to do any damage whatsoever.\n\n There's no BPAs that are released, no phthalates.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd what about over a 10, 20 year period.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, you still throw all that off, such a minute amount, get rid of it every day?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWould there be a material for pulp capping.\n\n\r\nHe wanted to use a dycal and he said that if you don't use something, I guess this is over the nerve?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I usually use Biocalyx.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a type of calcium rock that's powdered and it's pretty non-toxic?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, who's your dentist.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI use Britton Tijuana?\n\n Can you give us that address.\n\n Go to brittondental?\n\ncom.\n\n \r\nHe's a third generation dentist, so I converted him into a pretty holistic one.\n\n Handles a lot of my patient, fly in from everywhere.\n\n \r\nHe's a good looking, very big bear of a man.\n\n He's so gentle, perfect.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Weight Loss, Lose Weight In The Usmmer, Dont Gulp \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nYou said better to put on weight and hold it\n\n What about the weight loss thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLet your body go into a flu or cold and lose it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nDon't go on the weight loss, you're saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I don't mind you because you just have so many vaccines, so much medication injected into you?\n\n Probably the most I've ever seen besides military people.\n\n Your mother really did a job on you.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nShe didn't do it on me.\n\n I did it on myself when I had different vaccines or flu or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYour mother didn't vaccinate you when you were a child here in California.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I had to go for school.\n\n I took the polio vaccine, the polio sugar cube.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that was the cube.\n\n I'm talking about injections.\n\n If you're in California at your age, you had to have at least 18 vaccines.\n\n Now it's 58, 48, something like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you're saying if the person's vaccinated 20 times or more, it's good to put on weight and reduce, put on weight and reduce.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYep?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nI didn't quite understand what you meant about the rest of us, better just to wait.\n\n Better?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nJust keep the weight on and go into a cold or a flu to take it off.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, cause I don't take off weight when I go into a flu, I don't think I do.\n\n Maybe I just didn't know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWeigh yourself.\n\n You start a flu, weigh yourself at the beginning and weigh yourself at the end.\n\n Probably lose about 4 pounds, 2 to 4 pounds.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, forget about doing the weight loss.\n\n Cause I've been doing about, I was gonna do one again in this winter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWeight loss in the winter.\n\n Weight loss in the summer?\n\n You need too many nutrients in the winter, that's not a good time to lose.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nThe reason I do it in the winter is cuz in the summer, it's so hot, I'm so thirsty, I just drink tons of milk and I can't lose any weight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's cause you gulp.\n\n \r\n\r\nGet a straw, a glass straw, and you suck it through.\n\n You're gonna find you drink less, you're gonna feel better, and you're not gonna get thirsty when you.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen 80% of the water is leaving your milk and going to your kidney and not getting into your cells, you're going to dehydrate.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's like eating cheese, that's gonna dehydrate you.\n\n You've got all these minerals and all these nutrients to get to the cells, and they need to go on a vehicle of water to do that, and then the cell gets the water.\n\n But if you're gulping, most of that's just going right to the kidney.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's cause the body's saying, I need this water, and then all of a sudden it doesn't get it because most of its dumping into the kidney.\n\n You are giving your body a false promise.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, should I forget about the weight loss then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou're not in a bad shape, this poor girls in a bad shape?\n\n I wouldn't worry about it.\n\n When your body wants to take it off or go into a cold or a flu.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you go into a heavy pain cycle, you could eat a little bit more of your honey/butter or the pain formula to get through that.\n\n And then when that's over, you might want to go through a short, maybe three- or four-week weight loss period.\n\n Take advantage of that.\n\n \r\n\r\nOtherwise, just let a cold or a flu, take it off.\n\n You let your body decide when it's ready.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHer body is so confused.\n\n I have to force her, force the body.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nBut when the cold and flu, I don't change my diet to weight loss.\n\n I just do the cold and flu?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that's a different diet altogether?\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat's a smoothie and milkshake and if you sip them, you won't take as much.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nI have to buy a glass straw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nGet a glass straw.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI think if you did it spoon- \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nNo.\n\n Cause then you're not getting the saliva and all your bacteria in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut I know with straw, when I use a straw, it goes straight in the back.\n\n I protect my teeth that way, so I'm not really getting the saliva when I'm using the straw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, run it over the top of your tongue and through your teeth, so you're really sucking hard and you'll find all that saliva passes into your mouth with the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if I take the fluid in my mouth and swish around, it's more beneficial.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n But you have to understand that these glands are made to secrete fast for sucking.\n\n You swish it around, you have to swish it around, but if you're sucking, it pours out.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nHow do you suck on it.\n\n Did you take the straw and you put your tongue in the center?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n Give me a little straw.\n\n I don't worry about bacteria, suck it out the bottom so you don't drip it.\n\n \r\n\r\nI will put the straw on my tongue and suck it off the top and when you got a narrow passage like that, boy, that's a big straw.\n\n That's for sucking soups.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nExactly like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, not with my tongue out of my mouth and that cuts off the amount of?\n\n  \r\n\r\nLike I say, mine are half this wide, doesn't take anything to suck out of there.\n\n \r\n\r\nThere's no strain on the glands to cause much out here.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nDoesn't come up, nothing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay, then put it in front of your teeth and suck it through your teeth.\n\n \r\n\r\nSee, put it in front of your teeth and suck through your teeth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you sucked your finger, would those enzymes come down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot the same?\n\n But when you're sucking it through your teeth on your tongue, it's gonna be the same way.\n\n See the way she's doing it now, see.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf I had a big straw like that, my tongue would be in front of my teeth and I'd be sucking very hard, so it would string through my teeth and have to stream over my tongue?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen you see me drink this, you never see me do anything other than suck.\n\n I go like this.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm sucking over my tongue.\n\n I've got my teeth and everything, lips and everything hard together.\n\n So, I'm getting barely a string.\n\n I had no more than a tablespoon just then.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (39) Why Are Hot Baths So Hard, Lactic Acid \n \n**[2013],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\n102°, you get a little bit out\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat is it in the hot bath when you can't breathe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLactic acid?\n\n You're moving all the poisons, so all the nutrients, the red blood cells are getting highly contaminated, you can't utilize the oxygen properly, the brain is starting to throw off awful lot of chemicals, especially aluminum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what's the way to clean out lactic acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhey, the Sport

internet explorer because it takes hours to get everywhere.\n\n Firefox is very fast.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n That's what Jim said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI have to use Internet Explorer when I'm getting into one of my bank accounts.\n\n It won't let me get into one of my bank accounts without Internet Explorer.\n\n It's the only time I use internet explorer.\n\n I hate anything

made that uses alternators, rather than transistors so we can get rid of the EMF field\n\n And that's only 50 cents more per alternator, transistor.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAll these cars and everything, it would cost the companies about $5 to make non-EMF generating, cars $5 more.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd you can't ask for them to do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey won't do it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhy don't they do it.\n\n I don't get what the benefit is for them?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey want people to be sick?\n\n Most of the people who own oil and the car industry also have their major veterans in pharmaceuticals.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey want people sick.\n\n All of them do, big money.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (3) Appendix \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the appendix is a library\n\n It remembers everything that's ever entered the body and what to do about it.\n\n So, if you're missing it, your body has to take anywhere from 24 - 36 hours, sometimes even longer to reanalyze that substance and know what to do about it.\n\n \r\nSay you get a bee sting, once you get a bee stain the what to do about is is already registered in the appendix and the next time you get a bee sting, the body's not gonna have to analyze and decide what to do about it.\n\n It'll happen within 5 - 20 minutes, your body's already reacting.\n\n Without an appendix, it can take 36 - 42 hours before it will start doing what it needs to do to take care of itself.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then your body's changing all the time cause you're getting older and so every time you get stung, it's something different going on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt could be.\n\n Now, with me, I had my appendix removed at 15.\n\n5, within days after my third polio vaccine.\n\n It gave me angina pectoris.\n\n It gave me diabetes and angina pectoris at that age.\n\n\r\nI had my appendix out when I was 12.\n\n5 after my first polio vaccine, and then that one, they miss diagnosed and appendicitis and took out the appendix.\n\n \r\nI have no appendix, however, my body has developed, either it's regrown the appendix, which I don't know if it has, or I've developed another way for that library memory because last year right after the house in Thailand was built, I had my down pillows and sheets in a box and I took it out of the box, it had been sitting outside around the jungle waiting for the house to be finished so I could have a bed and my pillows.\n\n So, it was time, so I had the bed, I was pulling out the pillows, and I grabbed one like this and I felt a sting in my arm, and I pulled the pillow away and there was this tiny scorpion this big.\n\n\r\nAnd the baby scorpions, the tiny scorpions are the deadly ones because as the scorpion gets, It dilutes the venom, but the babies have a pure, solid venom that's not diluted.\n\n \r\nSo, the heaviness went down the arm, it got like a rash and flamed a bit, and all the way down I could feel it moving down here.\n\n\r\nIt was about probably 36 - 40 hours I experienced that and then it went away.\n\n Then five days later, I went and put some gloves on to work, and one stung me here, again a little bitty one, and that lasted about an hour.\n\n Then three days later, I got stung again.\n\n So, now I shake my shirts out, I shake socks out, I don't get into the bed, unless I've checked for scorpions first.\n\n\r\nBut that one didn't last 10 minutes, the last one.\n\n So, my body has found another way, or it grew back the appendix.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOr you're building up a resistance to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, your body has to have some area to store to know what to do, what compounds to make to defend itself against the venom?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Are All Parasites Good, Ebola Man Made Virus \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, you have parasites that don't belong in the human body, but any parasite that belongs in the human body is a good parasite\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut they're are manmade like Ebola is manmade.\n\n Now what they did was they created a chemical like they did with AIDS that destroys a lot of human tissue, it's a poison.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen they have a bacteria that accompanies and eats that degenerative tissue quickly.\n\n So, they talk about the flesh-eating bacteria, that's manmade.\n\n  \r\n\r\nLeonard Horowitz documented the making of Ebola and how they did it and how they made it to eat up so much of the human body.\n\n It eats only so much of the human body that's been damaged by the chemical that was in that injection.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the purpose of the parasite.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends?\n\n The trichinosis parasite is there to digest.\n\n Parasite can eat 100x its weight in 24 hours, bacteria eat 50x its weight in 24 hours.\n\n So, parasites can give you a lot more food quicker, they digest your food faster.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey're also those parasites that clean, eat dead cells, eat dead human cells.\n\n Of course, the pharmaceutical industry says, \"Oh, see, they're eating human cells.\n\n They attack the body\".\n\n Again, you have to say, which cells are they attacking.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf it's in a petri dish, it's not a live environment for human cells anyway, so they've got it in an unnatural environment, and its natural process is going to be to die or decompose and then of course those bacteria going feed on those cells and see the pharmaceutical industry says, \"See, it's eating those human cells and those were live cells?\n\n\" \r\n\r\nIt's all nonsense, it's pseudoscience.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (5) Bath \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, if I'm doing in the bathtub, what I do is I fill it halfway with scalding water for 10 minutes, it will heat the whole bathtub\n\n Then I put lukewarm water and bring it up to about 112° and then I let that sit for about two minutes.\n\n\r\nThen I put my ingredients: my milk, my sea salt, or Epsom salt, one or the other and the vinegar and I'll let that sit in there 7 minutes to neutralize the poisons.\n\n And then right before I get in, I put my 2 - 3 tablespoons of coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI put the milk, the sea salt or the Epsom salt and the vinegar in at 110°?\n\n\r\nThen I get in 7 minutes later, which is about 108°, 107° and then it takes 20 minutes for it to drop down to 102°.\n\n Then I'll let 2 inches of water out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI can go 40 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n That's terrific?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd I have a very accurate digital thermometer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I use.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey work really well.\n\n The ones from your website.\n\n Got nice big reading on there and I checked them out against other ones and they're very accurate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, I agree.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're off like only maybe 2/10ths of a degree at most.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhere do you get it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOxo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n From my product list.\n\n\r\nSo, then I'll let out 2 inches and when I get out down to 1 inch, then I'll run the hot water, just hot water and I funnel the cold water that's coming outta the hot water tap down to the drain like this, so the cold water doesn't disperse out right to the rest of the tub.\n\n Have water not caught in cold, right behind like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy hot water heater is right behind my bath tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, so it heats almost instantly.\n\n You could let yours almost down to the end of 2 inches.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI only let it down about 3 inches and I can bring it back up to about 107°.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut that's a whole three inches.\n\n I only let it out two inches and then raise it two inches with the hot water.\n\n \r\nWhen I'm putting the hot water in, as soon as I get down that last inch, then I plug the drain and switch the water around until it gets up to about 108° again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can't stay under water while that hot water's coming in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I'm sitting up, moving it?\n\n It's too freaking hot in my feet.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou're still doing hot baths now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n I've not even seen my 40 years yet.\n\n\r\nI still have lymphatic congestions in my irises, show up in my eye.\n\n Not a lot, but still in strategic places, especially along my back where they did all that radiation therapy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Best Vegetable To Juice (Carrot, Celery) \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus],[Carrot]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, if you are using, I like carrot, it sure helped me get out of my autism at 21 years old and I had it for 19\n\n5 years.\n\n I like the way the body can utilize a lot of water-soluble fats, make it into vitamin A, vitamin D, a lot of things that could be made from carrots, the water-soluble fats in carrots, but it's still high in carbohydrates, so that can cause advanced glycation end products to make the blood and the neurological fluids very sticky.\n\n**[Celery]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, to get away from that, I like to use celery because celery doesn't have enough carbohydrates to digest celery, so it's a negative.\n\n So, you use maybe a little bit more.\n\n Let's say you're using 35% carrot and 25% celery.\n\n That's a good balance right there.\n\n**[Cucumber]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd then cucumber.\n\n Cucumber to replace the collagen in your skin from all the damage from hydrogenated vegetable oils and all the toxins in processed food, which are supposed to leak through the skin.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou wonder why people have bad skin.\n\n Thick?\n\n The older they get, usually the thicker their skin gets because poisons accumulate in the skin, damage the collagen.\n\n They may scar, they may get all kinds of things.\n\n You get older, your skin has to tolerate all the toxins, it's supposed to tolerate 90% of the toxins that leave the body, so your skin will always be left in disarray the older you get.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you're eating cucumber puree, the pulp in cucumber, you're gonna get a lot of silica with the collagen precursors along with it help replace skin.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (7) Brain Worms, Trichinosis \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's all myth\n\n I would've been dead thousands of times.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou saw those maggots on the brain, you saw there.\n\n That was a, that was a made-up film, that wasn't real?\n\n They put them on this brain and around an animal skull.\n\n It's not even a human skull, it's not even a human brain.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey make up all kinds of shit.\n\n The pharmaceutical industry is really an evil- government, they have these shrill people that make up these stories.\n\n I have worked with people who were supposed to be the worst risk toward raw milk and raw meat, and none of them ever had a problem.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe only person I knew that had a problem, he called it, he said the doctor told him it was cuz he had trichinosis from a mongoose.\n\n He was a fruitarian for like 5 years, he had broken down his digestive tract.\n\n And of course, the trichinosis was trying to help him by digesting, but the pharmaceutical medical industry says, 'No, that's the bad guy\".\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd people believe it without any proof whatsoever, and it's really sad.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (8) Caffeine, Hormones Used As Detox, Adrenaline \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow's caffeine come into the picture?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a nerve irritant?\n\n It's a way to get bad energy if you don't have energy any other way, but if you're eating enough proper fats, you're gonna have the energy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know I stopped having caffeine headaches since I've been having a cranial sacral.\n\n\r\nI'm not like completely hooked on caffeine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I suggest a vegetable juice to help get the body going in the morning, full of enzymes and vitamins.\n\n Rather than have coffee or tea with caffeine in it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDoesn't it jack your adrenals up.\n\n I heard blood pressure and heart rate?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it attacks the nerves everywhere.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd I heard blood pressure and heart rate go up with only like 35 milligrams.\n\n It takes it up 10 points.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I can, depends upon the person.\n\n If they're thin, it's going to raise a lot of things.\n\n If they're fat, it's not gonna do that much damage.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, when you say near nerve irritant, it's raising metabolism.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the body tries to get rid of any toxins?\n\n When the body tries to get rid of toxins, it usually creates fatty substances, which are usually hormones.\n\n So, body will use a lot of adrenaline, adrenal glands.\n\n Adrenaline, like other hormones are 60% - 80% fat.\n\n\r\nFat, the body uses the harness with toxins, so the body will use whatever it can to defend itself from industrial onslaught.\n\n So, hormones is a way to do it.\n\n Adrenaline is a quick one to make, one of the quickest.\n\n Thyroid and adrenal, thyroxin and adrenal.\n\n \r\nSo,  it will overwork and excite the adrenals if you keep eating coffee, cuz the body will keep pumping out the hormones to try to neutralize the caffeine.\n\n That irritates the nerves and damages nerves.\n\n And that way it can exhaust your thyroid gland, it can exhaust your adrenal glands, can do a lot of damage.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Cant Get Butter, Salt, Bath Ing4editn, Acv, Chelation, Clay \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat if you can't get the butter and cream that you need to go in the water\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou don't put butter in that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you told my daughter she should have coconut cream, butter and cream and she can't get the butter and cream.\n\n She can't get milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nShe can get the coconut cream and vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, the coconut cream, yes?\n\n I must have made a mistake; it should have been dairy cream and coconut cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWe need dairy cream in our water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Well, you told her dairy cream, and coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nDairy milk, coconut cream and it should be dairy cream if you want, but I just use coconut cream, milk, vinegar and sea salt or Epsom salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, what if you can't get, she has had no luck and I didn't either when I was over in Maui trying to find any milk.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can't get milk, cream, butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have to have it shipped in if you want that from the big island or from Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, I asked that Lee Parish over the big island if he ship some over and he said no?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey don't have enough.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut you can use the coconut cream and vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, she could just use those two.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd then salt, sea salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you say what they do each individually again.\n\n Each individually does something different?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, the sea salt will cause the body to get hotter and perspire.\n\n Sodium is an explosive, that's why it'll eat things away, that's why it'll rust things.\n\n It'll eat a steel ship apart over time because sodium is an explosive when it's isolated, it's more volatile than nitroglycerin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThat was one of the projects that my father worked on for General Electric that worked for the military, that was one of the projects he worked on, and they received $2 billion to make sodium into a weapon and just 1.\n\n5° temperature change would set it off, so they could never do it.\n\n But a crystal, the size of a football would take out all of New York City, all of the buildings, just one crystal that big.\n\n That's why they want it, as a very efficient bomb, but there's no way to control it, which is a good thing.\n\n They do bad enough with uranium and stuff like that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo anyway, it has a tendency to break up the dead cells in the skin, helps dissolve them.\n\n It also helps neutralize things like fluoride and chlorine in the waters.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen the milk, can absorb the calcium, the phosphorous, magnesium, and potassium in the milk absorbs those toxins, so they don't get absorbed into your body.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe coconut cream is just to make your skin nice and soft, so it doesn't dry out when you get out of the bath.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat does apple cider vinegar do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nApple cider vinegar helps neutralize some of the poisons in the water?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDoes it actually go in and do something too for her pain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt doesn't, no, none?\n\n Not in my tests with it.\n\n But you've heard of chelation therapy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhere they put DMSO or into some of those toxic chemicals into your body to get heavy metals out.\n\n Well, the same amino acids are in raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhy would you use a chemical when you can use raw apple cider vinegar.\n\n It doesn't make any sense, but that's the way they make a lot of money, alternative therapists?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nYou can take it internally then too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n  \r\n\r\nLike I said, in my last newsletter, ever since I was between 14 - 15 years old, I don't remember when the test was done in my right carotid artery, I had a plaque on that artery and I had it checked.\n\n I have it checked about every 3 - 4 years by Lifeline Services.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I always had it checked, never did anything about it, never bothered me.\n\n I'm not an athlete, so I don't care.\n\n But then I decided to experiment, so for a year period, I alternately had a tablespoon of vinegar, either in some milk or in the sport formula, probably 45 times in a year.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd when I went back and had it done the next time, all the carotid artery was clean that quickly and that's the only thing I did different.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYou could put it in kefir milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I didn't put it in with kefir, I just put it in the milk, but you can put it in a kefir if you like it in kefir, that's fine?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI know you mentioned the clay too, goes in the bath too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou can put the clay if you don't have some of the other ingredients.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen you say clay, is that bentonite or French clay or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, your bentonite clay, a lot of people misuse that, bentonite clay was originally all from volcanic waste?\n\n That's not a good source.\n\n What happens when you have a volcano.\n\n When you have a volcano, it reaches, you know, sometimes 3000°, but it averages around 2300°?\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, all of your volatile minerals: calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, zinc; all of those are gaseous, they're gone.\n\n So, all you have is toxic heavy metals left in your lava.\n\n So, if you're taking clay from a lava bed, it's gonna be concentrated in toxic metals, mercury, lead, uranium, all that stuff.\n\n That's not a good thing.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I use Terramin Clay and the French Clays.\n\n Aztec or Azteca Clay.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWell, I don't know what it is now.\n\n Quite a few batches, so taken me years to go through them, big containers.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd back then when I got mine, Aztec Clay, I don't use Aztec Clay much anymore.\n\n I used mostly the Terramin Clay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the source of the Terramin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe Terramin is out in the Mojave Desert?\n\n It was an old aqua bed, an old thermal aqua bed, and of course, way down deep, it was a much higher temperature.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut they mine it where it never went over 98° and 98° is when you started altering the structure of phosphorus.\n\n So, the phosphorus is still intact.\n\n All the calcium, phosphorus, all the minerals intact.\n\n That's the only one I know that's intact.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (10) Casein Allergy \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou're allergic to what\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTo casein?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're not allergic to raw casein.\n\n Whenever you have those tests done, they use a protein that's been processed with kerosene or gasoline, hexane, so you're allergic to  that that they've made.\n\n\r\nIf you have raw dairy, you won't be allergic to it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Coconut Ceam Vs Dairy Cream (coconut 80-90% Detox) \n \n**[2013],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCoconut cream is very, very detoxing\n\n Coconut cream is anywhere from 80% - 90% detoxifying.\n\n \r\nRaw cream stabilizes the nervous system and the brain, and calms and protects the nervous system and brain, and calms the whole body.\n\n When the nervous system and brain are calm and not irritated, then you'll be calm and happier and raw cream does that better than any other fat, even butter.\n\n \r\nButter will certainly help, but you can't make the type of cholesterols to feed the brain and nervous system, all of the varieties of cholesterols needed to feed the brain and nervous system from butter.\n\n\r\nIt takes raw cream, whether it's the cream right from the milk or excess cream.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Coconut Oil Must Be Fermented, Oil Swishing \n \n**[2013],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe thing is I wanna ask you is about coconut oil, if you take a tablespoon of coconut oil a day with your meat meal and the lube formula, or what do you say on the coconut oil\n\n I bought it from Erwan, raw coconut oil?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends on how coconut oil is made.\n\n If it's truly from fermentation, it's a good oil.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt has to say ferment on the jar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the only way coconut oil can be truly cold pressed below 96°?\n\n \r\nI didn't look, Kathy, I don't know.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt has to say fermentation on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt should say coconut oil from fermentation?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're not doing that anymore with Wilderness Family Naturals.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know they're not.\n\n They have the centrifugal spinning and that gets too hot, also oxidizes.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, I should return it back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid you open it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I was doing my coconut oil pulling, but Max has the coconut oil in his shop.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know.\n\n I didn't look at his.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIf it doesn't say fermented, you can't use any of this coconut, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can use it for pulling?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nFor pulling is okay.\n\n What if you swallow some of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're not supposed to swallow any of it?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBy accident you swallow it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBy accident, you're not supposed to have an accident.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI do it every night before I go to sleep.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGood- is swishing some kind of fluid around in your mouth and allowing the chemicals that come from your brain to dump out your gums to dump in all at one time and then you expectorate it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHow can I find fermented coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, use olive oil if you don't like that?\n\n Use coconut cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nI do have it in my fruit meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Well use the coconut cream, it's cheaper.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nThe coconut oil I could do for the swishing in the mouth, okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you can also use coconut cream for swishing in the mouth.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nBut you said coconut oil at one time was better than using coconut cream when Fred asked you, I have a tape on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n Well, that's what I believed at that time, but it came out- my laboratory tests didn't show that it was any better.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, then I don't need the coconut oil, I'll just swish with the coconut cream.\n\n I should return it back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Different Types Of Bacteria Based On Diet \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you know, you have different types\n\n It depends on what diet you're on.\n\n \r\nIf you're on a vegetarian or vegan diet, you'll have different bacteria cuz your body will try to adapt to the diet you're on.\n\n Nobody does it well cuz what you have to do is you have to adapt like a cow or a goats or sheeps bacteria.\n\n When you do that, a sheep and a cow and a horse, all of 'em have 2.\n\n5x more digestive tract than we do.\n\n\r\nIt's 30x the length of their torso, they take 48 hours to digest their food, to break down the cellulose, to get the fats and the proteins from it, they have 60,000x more enzymes to do that than we do.\n\n \r\nSo, our bodies will try to adapt, never accomplish it, but still try to adapt.\n\n So, your bacteria are different from a carnivore, herbivore, fruitarian, all of those are different.\n\n\r\nAnd we should have all, pigs and humans should have the whip worm, trichinosis.\n\n That is the main digestive parasite in a human that should belong there.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Digestion, Mincedmeat, Campylobactera, Fat, Lymph Ssytem \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, it starts in the mouth, like I said, and a ton of bacteria infiltrates the food to start breaking it down and it goes to the stomach, your body secretes hydrochloric acid\n\n That's to dissolve larger pieces of protein meats.\n\n Let's say you're eating cheese, that helps you break down clumps of cheese.\n\n If you have minced meat, you don't need much hydrochloric acid because it's already in almost a liquid pate form, so the bacterias need to infiltrate.\n\n You have the Campylobacter, which is a prominent bacteria in the stomach, and the health department says, \"Oh, Campylobacter, that's a dangerous bacteria.\n\n\" Bullshit.\n\n It isn't a dangerous bacteria, it's part of the digestive process.\n\n \r\nAnd then, as it moves down into the ladder part of the stomach, the bile secretes into there from the bile duct coming from the gallbladder and that helps digest fat.\n\n It helps break down larger molecules of fat, so that the bacteria that eat fat can infiltrate it and break it down easily.\n\n\r\nFat molecules are very resilient.\n\n Just like you put fat on anything, even gasoline takes time to eat through the fat.\n\n So, fat is difficult to break down without bile, and then after the bile fractures the membrane of the fat cells, then the bacteria can infiltrate and eat it.\n\n \r\nAnd remember the feces, the urine, the sweat of bacteria is our nutrients, that's our food.\n\n So, you'll get beyond your squeamishness when you realize we all eat piss and shit and sweat, just a bacteria.\n\n So, get rid of all that squeamishness when you realize that and no animals or creatures, urine and feces are supposed to be toxic.\n\n\r\nIt's usually just byproducts of organic waste that could go in to feed the ground or feed some other creature.\n\n Feces is merely food that isn't completely digested.\n\n It's not supposed to be toxic, so it feeds the ground.\n\n Dogs eat it, many creatures eat fecal matter.\n\n That's their diet, it's just partially digested food.\n\n You shouldn't consider feces  something as a toxic, nasty substance.\n\n How many animals go around licking each other's butts every day and their own.\n\n If it were a problem, we'd all be dead and no creature would be alive today?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut all the toxins we consume.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, that makes it toxic.\n\n Any animal that's eating processed food with the 60,000 chemicals that they now use in food processing will have toxic feces and urine.\n\n And then when you go into the small intestine, you have several types of bacteria there and it just continues to eating that which you've eaten, and then that's absorbed into the lacteal system.\n\n The lacteal system is a fine web network that goes from the intestinal tract, all the way out to the lymphatic system.\n\n And when the food is digested, I don't care if it's blackberries or blueberries or anything dark or beets, bright red, everything that the bacteria eat turns milk.\n\n It looks just like this when it gets into the lacteal system, when they finish digesting it, their urine, their, sweat, their feces is all milk.\n\n \r\nThen the lacteal system absorbs it and breaks it down even further till it gets to the lymph system, and the lymph system is a translucent, like an opaque, translucent to an opaque milky substance.\n\n And then the lymph system has the job to feed every cell in the body, but most people's lymphatic systems are so jammed with hydrogenated vegetable oils, which is plastic fat that the lymphatic system can't even clean itself, which is its second job.\n\n\r\nFirst job is to feed every cell, second job is to clean all the waste out of the body, all the byproducts of metabolism out of dead cells, whatever it is, the lymphatic system is given the job to dissolve all that, neutralize it, send it under the skin for perspiring out of the body.\n\n 90% of waste are supposed to leave through the skin in perspiration, but when the lymphatic system is blocked, it doesn't happen.\n\n\r\nSo, the lymphatic system rarely transports nutrients anymore, the bloodstream does it, and the bloodstream is only supposed to transport oxygen to develop energy with fats in the system from whatever your body makes the fats, and it can make it from a lot of things, but the only pure fat for a human is animal fat.\n\n So, that's the best.\n\n \r\nSo, the lymphatic system is supposed to feed every cell in the body, but rarely in anybody does it happen, in any animal does it happen, unless they're a raw fooder and not that inorganic, toxic industrial chemicals.\n\n  \r\nThen in the bowel, when he gets down to there.\n\n Now the bowel is relatively short.\n\n The whole digestive attack is 12x the length of our torso.\n\n So 3 x 12 is 36 feet.\n\n So, our intestinal tract is 36 feet, yet the bowel is only about 3 - 3.\n\n5 feet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Doctors Recommend Supplements, Kerosene \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you know some physicians in this area that are sympathetic to your way of thinking\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot really?\n\n closest is Dr.\n\n Priviteraout, out near St.\n\n Bernardino.\n\n But he's into all these supplements.\n\n He doesn't really think that there's that much kerosene and gasoline in supplements and he recommends a lot of supplements.\n\n\r\nYet, there's a lot of kerosene or hexane and gasoline in supplements.\n\n\r\nWould you soak your food for 22 hours in gasoline or kerosene rinse it for two minutes and eat it.\n\n That's what all supplements are made of?\n\n Kerosene or gasoline.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's big money earner for 'em.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, that's huge.\n\n\r\nSame as medication.\n\n Everybody wants a magic bullet and people believe in magic bullets and there's no proof of it anywhere.\n\n The thing that happens when people take supplements, they get toxic kerosene or gasoline in their system.\n\n It raises their adrenaline level cuz their adrenals will make the hormones to deal with those toxins as fat and it raises their energy level and they're blaming it on the benefits of the supplements, instead of the toxicity of supplements is hatching as a adrenal reaction.\n\n \r\nIf they're on it long enough, of course they get adrenal fatigue, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, all kinds of accumulative problems with gasoline and kerosene collecting in the body.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nRemember, there was a guy named Maynard, who was the helping, you said he took too many supplements.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what he did.\n\n When I talked his surgeon in, the doctor wanted to go in and remove the whole jaw.\n\n He had a tumor this big on his face, and I went to his surgeon.\n\n I had to talk with the surgeon, surgeon wanted to remove the jawbone, all of the skin, everything and I said, wait a minute.\n\n It's part of the lymph gland system.\n\n So, if you just take out the tumor, leave the skin, leave the bone, the body will be there.\n\n You don't remove all the lymph glands cause they want to take the limp glands too.\n\n Said the lymph glands are what clean the body.\n\n Why would you want to do that.\n\n\r\nJust remove the fricking tumor, scrape it off the skin, there is going to be excess skin, of course, cut some of the skin away and then sew it back together?\n\n .\n\n So I had him retain the tumor and then had it analyzed, it cost almost $10,000 to have it analyzed for everything I wanted it analyzed for.\n\n And everything was minerals and vitamin supplements stored in that tumor.\n\n Concentrations.\n\n\r\n And then he got another tumor because he took them for 60 years and took supplements for 60 years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do they use the kerosene for supplements.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to take a substance, dissolve it to extract something from it?\n\n Let's say they're taking vitamin E from corn or soybean.\n\n They use the kerosene or gasoline to dissolve it to make it a liquid, then they extract the substances out of it.\n\n So, it's at least 22 hours soaking.\n\n Sometimes it's 5, 6 days.\n\n\r\nSo, it's lots of kerosene or gasoline.\n\n And they only rinse it for two minutes.\n\n It goes through a sprayer, rinses it off for 2 minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo they use that ingredient because it's the fastest way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's the only way you can get anything to dissolve?\n\n \r\nNo other solvents.\n\n You put it in water, it's gonna take a year and then you have bacteria that grows and fungus and everything else.\n\n They need something that's not gonna get a fungus or a bacteria and dissolves it and makes it a mush quickly.\n\n\r\nKerosene is natural, so that's what's in your natural supplement.\n\n If it's non natural, it's gasoline and hexane?\n\n There's no other way to do it.\n\n\r\nThat one big vitamin company, what are they called.\n\n I can't remember the name of it?\n\n They called me and their attorneys called me and said, \"Two of our top sales people were at your workshop in Chicago and you said that all natural supplements use kerosene.\n\n That is a lie, we do not use that and you need to put a ad retracting that statement in the New York Times, LA Times, Chicago Tribune and all the major newspapers like Toronto, wherever I give my lectures\", and I said, \"You want me to do that based on what evidence.\n\n\"\r\nHe said, \"Well, we don't, ours is all natural?\n\n We don't use any kerosene in ours\".\n\n I said, \"Did you know that kerosene is natural and that's the solvent they use.\n\n Go check with your laboratory?\n\n If your laboratory proves to me that they use something other than kerosene to make your supplements I'll borrow $500,000 and put those ads in\".\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Dont Use Kefir Grains \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nKefir, it will compete with yours\n\n It won't encourage your particular kind of bacteria because ours are different from a cows or a goats, or sheep or any animal where they use the rennet to help them.\n\n So, using your own saliva will always produce the best bacteria for you as an individual.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Drinking Milk In Hot Bath, How Much Fluid \n \n**[2013],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJoe made a comment about what you're drinking while you're taking the bath, and I know you said use a sport drink, but sometimes I'll just take room temperature milk and I'll sip some of that while I'm taking a bath and he suggested that, that you told him once maybe to put mineral water in with the milk\n\n\r\nIs that accurate or no.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I said mineral water in with a milkshake if you want to thin it a little bit, maybe some people I may have said thin the milk may be by 1/3 with water?\n\n Sometimes when you're eating just milk in a hot bath or a hot tub, you'll get caked, all the minerals will cake around the mouth and around the tongue cuz the body's using all those minerals to buy when the poisons are coming out of the brain and sometimes the body doesn't have enough water to help dissolve it, it causes too much drying.\n\n If I were to have that done, I would put a bit of a honey at the hot tub with me, and I would put honey on my lips.\n\n\r\nI wouldn't dilute with water.\n\n I would have the sport formula, and I'd have milk in the hot bath.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd when you have the milk, you have it straight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I'll have them both together.\n\n \r\nSo, sometimes I'll take a swig of the sport drink and then a swig of the milk, and then the sports drinks, right on top of each other.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI have a strong affinity for milk after I've had the hot bath.\n\n I just feel like drinking milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I drink milk in the hot tub.\n\n\r\nI want all those minerals in my system, so I drink both.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, how much of this do you drink.\n\n Like a quart of milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're in 90 minutes, absolutely?\n\n You can drink a quart.\n\n I never drink that much.\n\n I drink probably a half a cup before I get in, cup while I'm in, maybe 1.\n\n5 cups  and then 1/2 cup when I get out.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Exercise, Anxiety \n \n**[2012],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about exercising\n\n I do dance class, and yoga?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's great.\n\n You do any exercise you need.\n\n You have a tendency toward anxiety, anybody who has a tendency toward anxiety needs to exercise.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what I have to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd if you're like me, you don't build any of those hormones.\n\n You can just sit at a computer all day and not do a thing.\n\n My exercising is this.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Filling Type (porcelain) \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI want to get these two teeth done because this plastic flipper is really driving me crazy right now\n\n It's been probably a year and a half, two years wearing this  thing.\n\n\r\nSo, I should get porcelain with gold.\n\n How do they do that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you could have a plastic platform?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's what I have now is the plastic flapper thing, but I wanna have the teeth in there and that means he's gonna like have the patch with these two teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I have mine porcelain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou have porcelain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Not this one.\n\n \r\nThis tooth right here, you see it's gone through crooked.\n\n\r\nThat's the way it was when I was a child before I had braces and while I was chewing on the chicken bone about four months ago, the tooth went just crooked, just like it was, in an instant.\n\n Cuz it was in solid bone, it doesn't move, yet the whole bone and everything shifted with it.\n\n\r\nIt was weirdest thing.\n\n It was like the twilight zone.\n\n It was just, we crooked just like that.\n\n It was solid in there.\n\n This one's a porcelain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, there's no metal to strengthen it at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's just porcelain?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you think that's all I need for the front.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause it's 4 teeth altogether.\n\n The two are total fake and then they tear down these two side ones for support, unfortunately.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut that's to make a bridge.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTo make like a bridge thing.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, flapper is better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat I have now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it causes a lisp.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMine does too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's really a pain in the ass, I'm tired of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou hear your lisp more than I do.\n\n I hear my lisp more than other people do.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I'm eating something in particular, the whole thing will come out very easily.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr get underneath it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, that happens very easily.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll the time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen I'm home, I just take mine out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's what I try to do too, because it gets irritating eating all the time with this in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you just do it because if you're around everybody else, you don't wanna like go, \"Oh yeah, hi!\", you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well if you have those other teeth ground down, you're taking those teeth and you damage those teeth, so they're not gonna last as long as they were, probably half their life.\n\n\r\nBecause once you've grinded them down to the point where you can cement a whole bridge of teeth, you've damaged them all the way down to the tubules, which are soft.\n\n You put the epoxy over the tubules, that leaks all the way into the nerves and  those teeth will die much sooner.\n\n \r\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n It's maybe more convenient or inconvenient.\n\n It's easier to deal with the inconvenience of having a flapper.\n\n You have to decide what it's worth to you.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nCan you drink coconut water in the bathtub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can sip on it, but again, water is water?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou have the coconut water.\n\n What are you gonna do with it.\n\n What else do you do?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMix it with milk and cream and cheese?\n\n Something to remineralize, water is just a negative substance, even if it's from coconut water.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Foods For Big Breasts, Bone Marrow, Glands, Chicken and Fish \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat foods are the best foods to eat to grow your breasts big\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nShe wants to know what's good to grow big breasts?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm not gonna be shy, I'm gonna say it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBone marrow and chicken and fish and of course any glands of an of an animal, but what you have to do is you have these muscles around the breast, they need to be exercised to get the circulation in better.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, even if you're doing light pushups, it's like you put your arms out as far as you can and you just go like this and that exercises those muscles around the breasts, those get strengthened, the actual glandular tissue strengthens with it.\n\n And that's the best way to do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause I was doing the ovaries for a year over a year, and I didn't notice anything, I would do it in a shake, I would blend them up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOvaries aren't very strong, testes will help, any good hormone good, a calf's thyroid, which is very large.\n\n Buffalo thyroid, you have this huge animal and you got a little thyroid this big.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, a calf or a buffalo thyroid would be.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, Buffalo thyroid is too small, you're not gonna get much?\n\n But a calf's thyroid is about 2.\n\n5 pounds.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWhere do you get a calf's thyroid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you have to get in touch with a Amish farmer or farmer that's butchering a calf?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, just like how much bone marrow would you have a day with your meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you want to grow them faster, you can see how mine are developing nicely?\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou could have probably 3 tablespoons a day with your meat meal with a glandular meal.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd you have to have eaten that for- it takes time to digest it, get into the blood strong.\n\n So, let's say it takes about 4 hours, then you start exercising after that 4-hour mark.\n\n  \r\n\r\nLet's say you do 30 of those light with your arms stretched out.\n\n If you can do 'em out even farther, it's.\n\n The farther you get them apart, the more you hit the pectoral muscle there.\n\n Just get a little pressure on it, doesn't have to be huge.\n\n If you're way down like this, it's gonna be very hard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou start some activity in there, some activity in that area.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n When you're doing it like this, you're mainly going to get your trapeze muscles back here and you're not gonna get a lot in this area, but when you stretch them out, you can feel it all the way across here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you think thyroid is the best in terms of a gland.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause that's so much, they're large glands in some animals?\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (21) Gluten \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat's your opinion on gluten\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWe're not made to digest gluten?\n\n We don't have any enzymes to process gluten completely.\n\n We've adapted over the last 10,000 years of eating grains to break down some gluten, but not thoroughly.\n\n Only about 60% and that leaves byproduct, waste products toxins that get into the glycogen phase, of utilization of sugars for brain and nervous system.\n\n So, that turns into a glycogen that is even more sticky and even drying, dehydrating to the cells.\n\n So, gluten's not a good thing.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWe are meat eaters; we are animal cell eaters.\n\n Were you here when I talked about the digestive tract.\n\n \r\n\r\nI think that was right before you came, wasn't it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI heard about the bacteria?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, all of that.\n\n Okay.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd if you take, like I did in autopsies, I took the hydrochloric acid from the stomachs of 32 cadavers, and I put it on different foods to see what it would break down.\n\n It did not, but barely etch vegetables and fruit.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen I put the hydrochloric acid on meat, went right into it, put on nuts, barely etched.\n\n Softer nuts, it helped a little bit, but not a lot.\n\n Only on dairy products and meat and eggs did it react almost completely and thoroughly.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIt's the same with the human bile from the liver and gallbladder, put that on different fats: vegetable oils, coconut cream, butter, dairy cream.\n\n It all worked almost 100% on those.\n\n On the animal products, on the animal cells, but hardly worked at all on vegetation, vegetable fats, we maybe get 2% of vegetables, and that's mainly juice.\n\n So, juice your vegetables.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (22) H Pylori Is Good \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n It's a bacteria\n\n H pylori is a stomach bacteria and that is not a bad guy, that's part of digestion.\n\n Some of the h pylori though do clean and eat dead intestinal walls or stomach lining wall cells, your cells die all the time.\n\n 10% of your body is dying all the time.\n\n  So, these dead stomach cell walls, the Pylori eat them.\n\n \r\nIt's just like white blood cells.\n\n White blood cells are to eat dead red blood cells, so the contamination of dead red blood cells doesn't build up in the bloodstream.\n\n The white blood cells are called phagocytes eaters to eat dead red blood cells.\n\n That's what they're there for.\n\n \r\nPylori is there to help eat not only the foods that you're eating, but dead stomach tissue cells.\n\n That isn't a bad thing, but the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry wants to freak everybody out.\n\n Say, \"Oh, see these eat the human cells\".\n\n Yeah.\n\n Well, which state are those cells in.\n\n They're either decomposing or dead, or diseased to the point where they're almost dead?\n\n\r\nThey don't eat healthy live cells, they're just janitors.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're never cause any stomach problems.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't cause any stomach?\n\n Let's say you eat something with poison in it and you kill a lot of your stomach lining cells, your Pylori is going to be very high.\n\n Now you're gonna have symptoms from that poisoning, let's say bloody vomit.\n\n The pharmaceutical industry, medical industry is gonna say the Pylori are very high, they're the problem.\n\n No, they're just the janitors.\n\n\r\nBut they want you to believe that the body's attacking itself.\n\n They want you to believe that the body is ultra stupid like they are and most people believe them.\n\n And that's the saddest part about it, people believe their nonsense.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) High Meat \n \n**[2012],[Louis]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nPreparing high meat\n\n When I wanna start a batch, what percentage of air should be in the jar based on actual meat when you're putting it away to get old.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, it depends on when you want it to become goodbye meat?\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nHe's the comedian I thought *laughs*.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt should be 50-50.\n\n 50 air - 50 meat.\n\n**[Louis]**\n \r\n\r\nI see and then start airing it out for the first month.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you mince it, it's going to react faster?\n\n It's just harder to get air into minced meat, unless you fluff it up a little bit.\n\n**[Louis]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's basically it.\n\n How important is it to have high meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, just remember it feeds the brain and the nervous system?\n\n If you have any neurological problems, then you should be having it frequently.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (24) Human Lifespan \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike I said, many times, all creatures live 7x the time it takes 'em to finish maturation\n\n\r\nSo, for humans, we should be living to 147 years old, 147 years old.\n\n We're not even living half of that on the average, they're dying in their mid 60s when half of the life should be 75.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe Hunza's lived to be 150 I heard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSome of them.\n\n So do some tribes in Philippines and Georgia, Russia.\n\n\r\nNational Geographic, I think it was either between February and June, 1971 did an article on Georgia Russians that lived, there was one couple that was together for 128 years.\n\n Hell, can you imagine being together with somebody 15 years, much less, 128 years, and still loving each other.\n\n I mean, that takes health?\n\n You have to be a healthy individual where you're not expecting your mate to make you happy and healthy.\n\n You know, we have all of our problems in relationships because we throw the responsibility for happiness and wellness off onto somebody else.\n\n\r\nWe say, you have to make me happy.\n\n You're responsible for making me happy and you're gonna have nothing but a bad relationship, period.\n\n You have to take the individual responsibility for your happiness and your wellbeing and share your happiness and wellbeing, then it's easy.\n\n Like those people in Georgia, Russia.\n\n\r\nThey interviewed a couple that was 128 years.\n\n They were together 132 years, so they were in their mid to late 140s and then there was a couple that were together between 92 and 98 years, been so long since I've read it.\n\n And then another couple that was together about 111 years and happy together, and they showed one guy out on a horse at 129 years old, out there on a horse, herding the cattle.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you think we'll live that long if we stay on the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe were raised with too much toxicity?\n\n We could probably get to 110 - 120, I think.\n\n If nobody kidnap's you and injects you with crap  or no bus hits you.\n\n \r\nI remember I was at Stanford doing the British American Drama Academy and Richard Dreyfus was one of our professors and we were sitting down eating lunch one day and he says, \"What if you get hit by a bus\".\n\n\r\nAnd I said, \"I'll die healthy\", and he got it?\n\n He got it.\n\n He never said another thing, but he used to make a lot of fun of me eating that way.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Lemonade \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n Is there any issue with that or\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, water is a problem?\n\n Water's a solvent.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I guess I'm leaning towards more drinking the lemon juice.\n\n Is that a negative for your teeth or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can be, just rinse your mouth with some milk after you eat anything with lemon to make sure?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I wanted to have lemonade, if I wanted to take fresh lemons, let's say, and put some raw honey in it and just drink it as lemonade, is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot a good thing to have very often, you can put cream in it, maybe eat some cheese before you drink it so you don't demineralize because lemonade with the honey and the lemon will cause demineralization in the system?\n\n\r\nIf you eat cheese before you eat it and a little dairy cream in your lemonade, it's okay.\n\n It's still going to do more taking a part of your body than building, it's gonna dry your skin more.\n\n It's gonna dry your insides more.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Making Kefir&cottage Cheese, Sweet Vs Sour Milk \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nOkay, I'm just gonna go around\n\n Start off, Fred.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nMaking kefir and cottage cheese.\n\n I'll make it and a lot of times it ends up different, but I know you've said there's like three different kinds of bacteria, so I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how the variables affect.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, the temperature will decide which bacteria.\n\n You've got three main bacteria's in milk.\n\n**[unclear]**\n.\n\n**[unclear]**\n digests the proteins, the bulgaricus digests the fat, the acidophilus digests the sugars.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDepending upon the temperatures.\n\n If it's cold, the fat usually is prominent.\n\n The bulgaricus is usually higher, that creates a more sour in sometimes even bitter flavor.\n\n The warmer it is, usually the acidophilus will predominate and you'll have a sweeter kefir or yogurt.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want to make sure that the acidophilus predominates all the time so you have a sweet rather than a sour if you have that kind of a taste bud, it's good to put a little bit of honey in.\n\n It doesn't take much to spur the acidophilus to be more active.\n\n Probably a teaspoon per quart of milk is enough to make it gear on the sweet side.\n\n Of course, the more honey you add, the sweeter it's going to be okay, and it won't be just the sweetness from the sugar, it'll be the sweetness from the milk because the acidophilus will be more prominent at that point.\n\n More the sugars will be digested, along with the minerals and minerals make things very sweet too.\n\n  \r\n\r\nA lot of times you can have something that's very sweet tasting and not have any sugar in it, that's because of the minerals.\n\n It has the alkalizing minerals, which have a sweet flavor.\n\n If you have milk that separates like Kathy's there, you can just put it in a blender for three seconds, it'll be back into a thick kefir again.\n\n You don't have to drink it separated like that and it just takes three seconds, maybe not even three seconds, two seconds, two to three.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you want an acidophilus or yogurt that is best for you in human, then you use your own saliva as your starter.\n\n You've got more bacteria in your mouth and your saliva than dogs and cats, and that's where we start our digestion.\n\n  \r\n\r\nRemember, Digestion is supposed to be at least 90%.\n\n Bacterial is supposed to be 90% of digestion, so it starts in the mouth.\n\n So, if you take some milk and swish it around in your mouth for a minute or so, and then expectorate that back into the milk, that's using your own bacteria.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you use a cow's rennet or the grains from a cow's stomach to make your yogurt or kefir, it will compete with yours, it won't encourage your particular kind of bacteria because ours are different from a cow or a goat or sheep or any animal where they use the rennet to help them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, using your own saliva will always produce the best bacteria for you as an individual.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nSometimes it comes out like almost fizzy.\n\n What causes that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nLike turning alcohol, that means it's getting too hot, too fast, and a lot of alcohol forms in it, and that causes a gaseous reaction?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nI've had that even in the fridge.\n\n I just let it sit in the fridge, but for a long time, maybe several weeks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it'll still do it.\n\n Turn in alcohol, absolutely.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nAnything to do to prevent it doing that.\n\n Because sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it does?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt depends upon how warm the milk got before you put in the fridge.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n That's probably why, it got warmed then.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYou don't want it warm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI like it warm?\n\n I will make my kefir out of the fridge and then put it in the refrigerator, but I'm usually consuming it within a week.\n\n Mine rarely ever goes beyond a week.\n\n If it does go beyond a week, it will get fizzy, it'll separate.\n\n You can blend it and that'll get rid of some of the gas, but still you have a high concentration of alcohol.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nWhich is not good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, it just cause more detoxification?\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd there's no limit.\n\n Let's say you've got some kefir and you've got a whole bunch, you can keep it for months, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n It's up to you.\n\n If you're like the Germans, you like it stinky and rotten.\n\n Really nasty stuff.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (27) Meat Meal After High Meat, Lube Formula, Cheese Schedule \n \n**[2012],[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWe have to wait an hour\n\n Let's say if you have your high meat at 5:00 PM, you wait an hour for your regular meat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, you can eat it 10 minutes later?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\n10 minutes later.\n\n Your regular meat meal with the lube formula, the lemon and everything in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYep?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's all it takes is 10 minutes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but you know, if you have the lube formula, It might be better to wait 10 minutes after you finish your meat meal cause the lemon might neutralize some of that and prevent it from absorption the same way?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYou sure it's 10 minutes though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf you're having meat with butter, if you're having the lube formula, you might want to wait to have the lube formula after you finished the meat meal?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\n10 minutes after.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then you could have half an hour after that, 35 minutes after that, you could have the cheese and honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, what I've done, I've changed that a little bit.\n\n 25 minutes after you've finished the meat, have a little sugar cube sized amount of cheese, 10 minutes after that you have your cheese and honey, because I don't want any poisons getting into the honey and cheese.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's only if you have high meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, no, no?\n\n That's any time after a meat meal.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nYou wait 10 minutes after you have the sugar cube.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAfter you have that little sugar cube?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou go 25 minutes after you finish the meat meal, you have a little sugar cube amount of cheese and then 10 minutes after that you have your cheese and honey together for your mineralization.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's something different.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I just wanna be sure that you don't get any poisons from the stomach lining or the intestinal walls into the cheese that's going to digest and get your mineral supplement when you eat it with the honey, just like I have you eating cheese 10 minutes before everything, absorb the poisons, so when you eat your meal, whether it's fruit or meat or milkshake or whatever, the poisons are not gonna get into your food that's going to be digested.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, if you have the fruit meal, it's the same thing again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have a piece of cheese?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\n10 minutes after you eat your fruit meal, you have another half a teaspoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nOh.\n\n That's only for the meat meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOnly for the meat meal to have cheese and honey together?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm talking about the sugar cube after the fruit meal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, you eat it before.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nA teaspoon, that's what I have.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (28) Meniscus Tear \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nDo you have any remedy for a minor tear in the meniscus\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, anytime you have a tear anywhere it's subcutaneous?\n\n So, applying anything that will help get fat into the area, deep into the tissue, so like putting butter or bone marrow on the area and then applying meat on top of that, and then like a damp cloth, cotton cloth or silk cloth on top of the meat to keep it from drying and then a piece of plastic over that, and then wrap that with ACE bandage.\n\n Keep it on not too tightly and then you take a hot water bottle.\n\n You put it in a pillow case.\n\n If you have just regular cotton pillow case, then you may put it in two of them if you have your hot water bottle up to, let's say 142°.\n\n It's pretty hot, it will burn the skin.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOr if you use a flannel pillowcase, it only takes one and you put it inside and wrap it around.\n\n Then you put that near the meniscus and then wrap a towel around both the hot water bottle and your leg or ankle foot, and that tents the heat into that area while you sleep.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you wrap the hot water bottle in a pillow case, especially a flannel, it will keep it hot 2 - 3 hours longer.\n\n So, you can go 7 - 8 hours without cooling.\n\n So, you can have the benefit of a hot water bottle in that area for that many hours.\n\n If you don't, the hot water bottle will broadcast its heat throughout the entire bed under the covers, and of course that will lessen the heat sooner in time, like maybe 2 - 3 hours, maybe 3.\n\n5 hours it won't be hot.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut if you wrap it in a flannel pillow case, it will stay warm for 6 - 7 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd how, how many days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nEvery day until that- it usually takes about 10 weeks for meniscus to mend properly on a good diet?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat if somebody's in a lot of pain with the meniscus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSame thing?\n\n The heat will take care of it and plenty of cheese and butter, lube formula.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (29) Nightshades, Tomatoes, Peppers \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nTomatoes are the only good nightshade that I will eat\n\n All the other nightshades are roots, which can be very complicated in digestion.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nLike red peppers or orange peppers you can't eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I'll eat those to an extent, but they will they can cause nerve damage or nerve detoxification too quick?\n\n Like I said in the book, you eat too many bell peppers, the hot peppers are not the same.\n\n With bell peppers, you can cause tooth detoxification and create a lot of tooth pain from it.\n\n So, that is just a flavor, like a sauce or something, not to eat lot of.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (30) Oil Is Detoxifying, Olive Oil \n \n**[2012],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat should I do with the remainder\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat did I just say?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOkay, until I finish with it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n \r\nOil is always 90% detoxifying, so I suggest that people have no more than a tablespoon of oil if it's cold pressed, stone pressed, like stone pressed olive oil, one tablespoon a day.\n\n If you're going to have a sauce with it, like a mayonnaise made with the olive oil and you're gonna have a lot of mayonnaise at one meal, then don't have any for three or four days, but keep it to a minimum cuz it will cause heavy detoxification.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHave it with your meat, your of olive oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can have it with anything?\n\n It doesn't have to be with your meat meal.\n\n I prefer oil not being with a meat meal cause I don't want to turn my meat meal into a detoxifier that's what my fruit meal is for.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, what do you use the olive oil by itself during the day.\n\n\r\nJust take a tablespoon?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you could take it with your fruit meal, at the same time as your fruit meal?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOlive oil with, with raspberries.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can just take your tablespoon of olive oil and eat your fruit meal?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSwish it around your mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can swish it if you want and spit it out or you can swallow a tablespoon of coconut oil or olive oil and then eat your fruit meal?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Poison Ivy, Why Does It Affect Certain People, Urine For Skin, Drinking Urine \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, if you have low vitamin D in your skin, you're going to have problems with those oils\n\n See, those oils in the ivys are very, very caustic and they're almost like kerosene or gasoline, and they will eat into the cell and rupture and burn the cells.\n\n That's what causes the blistering.\n\n\r\nIt actually burns the cells.\n\n So, that's what happens when that oil gets on you.\n\n It doesn't spread, the body will dissolve the oil and move it so it doesn't burn in just one spot.\n\n It'll keep moving it till it's gotten rid of all of the oil, the ivy oil.\n\n \r\nYou can minimize that by putting something on there that'll break it down ,like take pineapple or lemon juice or lime juice and put it on there and break that oil down.\n\n Of course, a lot of it's gonna be absorbed into the skin.\n\n It's gonna be burning the skin, but at least you can take off any surface area to keep it from spreading.\n\n \r\nAnd then, like I say, to heal the skin, use urine, old urine is better.\n\n The ammonia will arrest any oils that are embedded in the skin and the cells and the nutrients that are in blood, which are the same as in urine.\n\n \r\nUrine is nothing other than blood without red white blood cells and some extra ammonia that the kidney has developed to prevent red and white blood cells from entering the kidney and being pissed out of the body and you're being anemic every time you urinate.\n\n\r\n So urine, if you're not on a good, healthy diet, is not toxic.\n\n It's a nutrient dense liquid.\n\n Astronauts drink their own urine up there, they just filter it.\n\n In India, vegans, they drink a lot of their urine to recycle the proteins and b12.\n\n\r\nSo, applying that to the skin that's been damaged from one of those ivy oils helps the skin quickly.\n\n The ammonia helps stop and neutralize the oils, the caustic oils from the ivy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I don't get it.\n\n That means I have enough Vitamin D, but everybody else doesn't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n If you don't get it, your, your skin is fine.\n\n\r\nIt's protected, well protected.\n\n That's interesting.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat does the vitamin D do.\n\n Does it block it from getting into your skin?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it doesn't penetrate?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Problem With Equilibrium, Tinnitus, Hot Water Bottle \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat means one ear has more fluid in it than the other\n\n \r\nDo you have one that has more ringing or hissing or sounds like you're underneath the sea.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSometimes I have the tinnitus, but I haven't had that for a long time?\n\n But lately it's just been the equilibrium imbalance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, maybe your nerves are dead and you can't tell anymore.\n\n\r\nSo, get a sense.\n\n Whichever way you have a tendency to fall is your weak side.\n\n So, that side, you put the hot water bottle against that ear at night, get that excess fluid out of there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it doesn't matter which side from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, if you perspire the excess fluids out of one of them and it's the wrong side, then the other one's even going to be more imbalanced and you're gonna have even more vertigo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, basically you have to increase the liquid in your ear again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDecrease.\n\n But every day you're going to increase the liquid, so you may have to use hot water bottle alternate on one side to the other each night.\n\n If you have it in one particular ear more than the other, maybe two nights in a row on this ear and one night on this ear.\n\n Rotate it that way.\n\n Depends upon your particular problem.\n\n \r\nWell, what you can do.\n\n Usually, if you'll run around the house, do something that causes a little aerobics and you lie back and you just go like this in both ears.\n\n You can tell which one has more pressure in it.\n\n\r\nThat's the one to put the hot water bottle against.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Reduce Breasts \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou want to reduce your breasts\n\n Hot water bottles on them, perspire out the extra fluids?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes it shrink the fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt does shrink the fat?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Regenerate Tooth Enamel, Cheese, Suppository \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nCan you regenerate tooth enamel\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, I've seen it, but not on, not on people over 35?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nReally.\n\n Okay, so what does my daughter do, you told her brain is detoxing and so some of her enamel on the front of her teeth are missing?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat can she do for that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, she has to eat lots of cheese?\n\n She has to eat cheese like every 30 minutes.\n\n A little sugar cube size amount, 1/2 teaspoon.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, how do you keep from getting so constipated.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you'll just have to use the suppository?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd so how long would it take her to, to start regenerating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHow old is she and how long has she been on diet?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nShe's 38 and you just met with her on the big island, but since she can't get milk and some of the other ingredients, she's eating raw now?\n\n I mean, she was a vegan before, but she's eating more the way you suggested she eat, but she can't get all of those foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThen she probably won't regenerate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, do you know Jennifer Nelson.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBecause she had the same, I don't know why hers was missing, but she's had some missing and she's been doing energy healing work, and I see her every couple of weeks at the co-op and it's starting to grow.\n\n The enamel is starting to come back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, she hasn't shown me that, so I don't know.\n\n I have to see it to believe it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nLike I said, I've only seen people up to 32 years old and they're doing the diet 100, they do the cheese and the milk and everything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nJoe's done it.\n\n Joe's gotten an enamel back.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nNo.\n\n Remineralization.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRemineralization is not re-enamelization.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the difference.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe enamel is a harder substance?\n\n It's almost like silica glass based substance.\n\n Remineralization is maybe remineralizing the tubules.\n\n Now that can get hardened and make a harder surface, like a dentine, but the enamel, it's not quite as hard and it's discolored.\n\n Yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou're saying the silicone, they can form that left layer again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI've seen it done in people up to 32 and first I saw was in a 24 year old?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd so, you just live with those sorts of gaps in your teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, they can fill up, but you won't get a dentine on them?\n\n Remineralize.\n\n, but not dentine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, should she go to the dentist then to get something put on.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIt's up to you, you can have that bonding put on it, but then you're gonna poison your tubules again?\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (35) Scorpion Sting \n \n**[2012],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, it was time, so I had the bed, I was pulling out the pillows, and I grabbed one like this and I felt a sting in my arm, and I pulled the pillow away and there was this tiny scorpion this big\n\n\r\nAnd the baby scorpions, the tiny scorpions are the deadly ones because as the scorpion gets, It dilutes the venom, but the babies have a pure, solid venom that's not diluted.\n\n\r\nSo, the heaviness went down the arm, it got like a rash and flamed a bit, and all the way down I could feel it moving down here.\n\n\r\nIt was about probably 36 - 40 hours I experienced that and then it went away.\n\n Then five days later, I went and put some gloves on to work, and one stung me here, again a little bitty one, and that lasted about an hour.\n\n Then three days later, I got stung again.\n\n So, now I shake my shirts out, I shake socks out, I don't get into the bed, unless I've checked for scorpions first.\n\n\r\nBut that one didn't last 10 minutes, the last one.\n\n So, my body has found another way, or it grew back the appendix.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOr you're building up a resistance to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, your body has to have some area to store to know what to do, what compounds to make to defend itself against the venom?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Shaving, Milk \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I have scarred skin and I cut fairly easily\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWhat did you say.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's dealing with shaving and I think the last one you mentioned, cause I tried them all, coconut cream and cream, I've tried that and it doesn't work?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo kidding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I've gone back to an electric razor cause I'm cutting myself, I have any other ideas?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I hope you're not shaving more than three minutes, cuz the EMF field is pretty strong.\n\n Does it take you more than three minutes to shave.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine.\n\n Just put some milk on after.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you do a hot bath.\n\n When you do a hot bath, your beard is so soft it comes off just like nothing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen I shave, I used to use coconut cream cuz I never cut myself, but the coconut cream would hard, especially when I'm an Asia, there's no hot water.\n\n They don't use hot water cuz it's hot all the time.\n\n And you can't rinse that coconut cream with the whiskers out of the blade, I had sticks in there, so I went to milk and that I can rinse out with cold water and the milk was just as smooth as the coconut cream for me, but I just don't put it on and immediately shaved, I put it on, I go do something for5 or 7 minutes, then put more on and then shave to soften the beard a bit.\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nHave you stopped using egg white for shaving.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I stopped using egg like probably 6 years ago, then I went to coconut cream, and then now I'm at milk .\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou put it on before you shave and then after.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I put it on after too.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nIt's cold milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's room temperature?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat would be in the milk.\n\n It seems like that wouldn't work very well?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt works wonderfully and I can rinse it out so easily?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, it softens the whiskers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you leave it on 5 - 7 minutes?\n\n\r\nDo you leave it on your skin or do you immediately start shaving.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I would immediately shave?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n There's your problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd it was cold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat would do me too, I would cut myself to piece.\n\n I did it one time and I just cut this side of my face and this side of my face.\n\n I just had scrapes galore.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Stem Cells, Bone Marrow, Lymphatic Clear From Cheese and Hot Baths \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nSusan Summers, I saw on tv, she lost her breast from cancer\n\n She had adult stem cells implanted and she grew it back?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nDoes that work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I've got a man who's been on the diet 12 years and that's what he does.\n\n He has an international stem cell company in Bangkok.\n\n So, people fly to him or he has connection with quite a few, he had his own clinic, but his son overspent money and absconded with $5 million.\n\n His own son bankrupt him.\n\n So, sometimes you can't even trust your own blood.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhat you do is you go and have the blood taken, and there's a way to separate the red blood cells without a chemical.\n\n \r\n\r\nNormally, they'd use some solvent to dissolve them, but stem cells are whole large cells and there's a magnetic way to separate them.\n\n So, then they separate the adult stem cells and then reproduce them in a laboratory in Israel, and then send them to whatever country it is and then they inject them.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDon Ho hadn't worked in, I think it was about four years.\n\n Anybody know who Don Ho is.\n\n He's singer of Hawaii?\n\n Famous Hawaiian singer in the 60s and the 70s.\n\n And anyway, he had a heart transplant, and a lot of difficulty bypasses and nothing was working out.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, he went to my friend Don in Bangkok and he had stem cells taken here, sent to the laboratory in Israel and then injected into his heart in 40 places.\n\n He was back to working in two months.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI saw one elderly man that was in a wheelchair and he had the stem cells injected all in his heart, and he was playing tennis in three months.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nIs it very expensive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nVery expensive?\n\n $30,000 - $50,000.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nFor a shot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well, you get 40 - 50 injections of it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\n\r\nFor one treatment.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nOne treatment, yes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nCould they do it to the spinal cord at some point.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey can do it to any part of the body?\n\n It's just that you have to have a doctor who's familiar with those particular stem cells they segregate, isolate from the blood, like there's pancreatic for diabetics, there's heart for heart, there's lung, there's spinal cord.\n\n You have to know the difference, and you have to have a laboratory who knows how to do it and then a doctor who will inject them into that area of the body.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I'd rather just eat bone marrow.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nBut that's gonna take 30, 40 years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot necessary?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nThis goes automatic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n It will go automatically to that part of the body.\n\n Yes, it will.\n\n But if you put hot water bottle on the area where you're having difficulty and you're taking 90-minute hot baths a day, your system's gonna move fast.\n\n \r\n\r\nIn the last three years, I still have two more to go before I'll be satisfied with the results.\n\n Been having people doing 90-minute baths instead of just 40 - 45 or 35 - 50 minute baths, plus eating cheese anywhere from every 15 - 45 minutes of the day to collect the poisons that are in the intestines and stomach so it doesn't remix with the food nd then you redigest your poisons that are in the system.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThe hot baths make sure that you melt it out of the lymphatic system and perspire out of your skin where 90% of toxins are supposed to leave the body.\n\n So, people used to progress the normal rate that Howell and Pottinger found that it took animals to reverse their diseases, which was five generations.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, for humans, that would be 37 - 40 years.\n\n Since I've had people doing it at least 5 days a week, 90 minutes a day, plus the cheese every day, anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes daily.\n\n The increase in lymphatic activity and cleansing and healing has tripled.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I think that, I don't know if there's a point where some things can move so fast and some things can't, I'll get a better idea at 5 years and 10 years and 15 years, but right now, the initial results show 3x faster cleansing and healing.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nCan you break it up in a day.\n\n Like half an hour?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, it needs to be a 90-minute stretch?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\n\r\nAt one time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Imagine this, you've got a stick of cold butter in a two-cup glass jar.\n\n You've got 105° outside.\n\n How long is it going to take for the outside heat to change the temperature of the inside air around the butter, which is generating a colder temperature.\n\n How long is it going to take?\n\n It takes 90 minutes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDo you have to have the foods that you recommend in the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes?\n\n In the water, if you have municipal water.\n\n If you have well water, you don't have to put ingredients in the water.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (38) Type Of Clay \n \n**[2012],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\n I know you mentioned the clay too, goes in the bath too\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can put the clay if you don't have some of the other ingredients?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen you say clay, is that bentonite or French clay or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, your bentonite clay, a lot of people misuse that?\n\n Bentonite clay was originally from volcanic waste.\n\n That's not a good source.\n\n What happens when you have a volcano.\n\n When you have a volcano, it reaches sometimes 3000°, but it averages around 2300°?\n\n\r\nSo, all of your volatile minerals: calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, zinc, all of those are gaseous, they're gone.\n\n So, all you have is toxic, heavy metals left in your lava.\n\n So, if you're taking clay from a lava bed, it's gonna be concentrated in toxic metals: mercury, lead, uranium, all that stuff.\n\n\r\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n So, I use Terramin clay and the French clays.\n\n Aztec or Azteca Clay.\n\n I don't know what it is now.\n\n I have quite a few batches, so taking me years to go through them, big containers.\n\n\r\nAnd back then when I got mine, Aztec Clay, I don't use Aztec Clay much anymore.\n\n I used the mostly Terramin clay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the source of the Terramin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe Terramin is out in the Mojave Desert?\n\n It was an old thermal aqua bed.\n\n And, of course, way down deep, it was a much higher temperature, but they mine it where it never went over 98° and 98° is when you start altering the structure of phosphorus.\n\n\r\nSo, the phosphorus is still intact.\n\n All the calcium, phosphorus, all the minerals intact.\n\n That's the only one I know that's intact.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Aajonsu Weight \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are two ways to measure the fat content of your body\n\n There's a scale and you put your height in it and stuff like that and there's a way that it measures your fat level, and then there's this like a high blood pressure machine that you put around and it's an electro field.\n\n\r\nCapacitor.\n\n And it measures the fat level.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about the ones that you hold in your hands.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike, I've never tried one of those, so I dunno?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe health foods, the gyms have them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't go to gyms.\n\n I don't exercise.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, you can walk in there and ask for an evaluation for free.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, how do you have big muscles.\n\n I'm sorry, I'm just confused?\n\n How do you know it's not bigger muscle.\n\n How do you know it's fat and not bigger muscle?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause the way they've measured it out the electromagnetic, the biofeedback tells the machine, because it has a certain resonance, fat has a certain resonance, so when it comes back, it tells how much resonance is fat?\n\n\r\nHow much is bone, how much is muscle.\n\n They can differentiate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, you'd think that machine wouldn't be able to tell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the scale for some reason.\n\n I don't know how they did it, but the scale works almost within a percentage or less than one percentage.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWell, the old way was different was a caliper measurement that can pinch and you can go on charts.\n\n So, a lot of people know how to do that, that's pretty simple.\n\n But that's less effective than the electronics.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut when I was getting ill, I like to stay up around 27% fat, so I usually looked about like Kim here.\n\n So, that's where I like to hold my weight, but in the last two years, I've been getting rid of a lot of old fat molecules that has shrunk my bones and everything to where I was when I was a teenager.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause I've gotten rid of all the skeletal structure that was built with old wwollen fat molecules?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, you're eating the same and just your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, you only have five more years and you're totally clean.\n\n It takes 40 years?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it takes 40 years?\n\n Yeah.\n\n So, I've got six more years.\n\n No, no, that's, well, let's see.\n\n\r\nOf eating meat on a daily basis.\n\n I say it from the time you start eating meat on a daily basis, but it may be just going raw for me.\n\n I don't know.\n\n For raw, I've been eating raw since 72, so 82 92 and that's 30 years.\n\n 34 years, so 6 more years to 40.\n\n \r\nBut I thought it was eating meat on a daily basis cuz that's when I got the real health and energy when I started eating the raw meat and that was in 76.\n\n So, that's 30 years, so I really have 10 more years to go, but that's theoretical.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAs far as American are concerned.\n\n I mean, if we stayed on this diet when you're 25, would you look so much younger when you're 75 or versus like you said, I mean, did they not get the wrinkles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey don't get the wrinkles?\n\n\r\nThey don't look like all dry and wrinkely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Thin, Cooked Fats Swelling, When Aajonus Started Eating Raw Meat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEverybody's noticed how thin I am\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Wasting away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, actually, the fat level is staying high.\n\n I'm now 20% fat.\n\n I was 22% about three months ago, so I've lost 2% fat because I'm going through a detox and a cold.\n\n But I thought that, I thought there would be five generations, about 38 to 40 before I'd had all the old toxic fat molecules out of my body.\n\n \r\nWhen you eat a cooked food, the fat molecule has swollen anywhere from 10 - 50 times its normal size.\n\n So, you can imagine the girth that people have.\n\n Only the tribes like the Fulani's that eat 90% dairy do they have more girth in their bodies.\n\n\r\nBut the Samburu and Messiah are very tall and very thin, yet their fat level is 18% - 20% cause the fat molecules are very small.\n\n \r\nWell, I'm at that point now, so I'm a 30 inch waist, 29 at my low side, 33 top.\n\n So, I'm a 31 right now.\n\n So, in the last two years, my body has detoxed a tremendous amount out of the bone.\n\n\r\nSo, even my bones have shrunk, but everything's dense.\n\n No osteoporosis.\n\n So, this will be the ultimate skinny diet eventually, but I don't want anybody to think.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n35 years or so *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I have to look at, it's been 34 years since I started eating all raw foods, so it took me 34.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen did you start eating the raw meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I started eating raw meat in 76, so that's 30 years, it'll be 30 years in September since I have been eating raw meat?\n\n And then eating raw meat on a daily basis was 82, so it takes a while.\n\n \r\nWith the raw food, you have to count from the time I started raw food, not raw meat, cuz that's when I stopped eating the cooked fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, everybody's gonna be different too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverybody will probably dig different.\n\n I have one lady who's only been on the diet 14 years, and she's trimming down.\n\n She's keeping a high fat level, like 24%, but she's really skinny now, you know.\n\n \r\nSo, she did it in 14 years, she had breast cancer?\n\n So, people will do it at different stages, but it took me 34.\n\n\r\nSo, get used to me thin.\n\n I'm not used to being thin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow interesting.\n\n You didn't change anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Didn't change it.\n\n Finally, just, well, there's one thing that I changed year and a half ago.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aluminum Pulling With Rasberrries and Coconut Cream \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEating raspberries with coconut cream will help pull the aluminum out in a non-toxic way\n\n Hopefully it won't all go out through the scalp.\n\n \r\nEven with those mixtures at your age, it's going to be difficult not to keep it from turning your hair gray.\n\n But my hair was completely gray after chemotherapy.\n\n\r\nAnd it goes in, five years ago, I had a whole patch of gray here that stayed there for about a year and a half.\n\n Went back again, goes in and out.\n\n Here this was all gray a year and a half ago.\n\n It's going back to its color.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's got a browner look.\n\n I'd swear that you dyed it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's getting dark.\n\n Well, always in the winter it gets darker, and then the summer is lighter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo eggs, I have never not eaten eggs every day.\n\n I've always had at least five eggs a day for two and a half years.\n\n That's alright.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine, wonderful?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSome days I eat 12, sometimes I have 18.\n\n I have never felt relief for my lungs eating that huge amount of eggs every day for a month and I didn't feel any change in my lung.\n\n I'm not saying it didn't do it, but I didn't feel anything so.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's to arrest the poisons.\n\n\r\nBut if you've got fibroids in your lungs, the eggs aren't gonna work that.\n\n You need bacteria in the lungs.\n\n You need the foods that are high in bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm always having my clabbered milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nClabbered milk helps the bacteria in the intestines, but not in the lung.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Amos Chicken, Soy Chicken \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus],[unclear]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot any different, \n is the same\n\n It's just that the Rocky Junior's gonna be younger, more tender.\n\n The older animal's going to be more tough.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that the only kind you buy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the only kind I buy here?\n\n \r\nI'll send away when I know I'm going to be in town for a while.\n\n \r\nI buy the chicken Amos Miller, an Amish guy who feeds the chickens exactly what I want him to feed them.\n\n \r\nHe feeds them high meat as their protein, feeds them nothing, but you know what they peck around in the yards and high meat.\n\n \r\nI get meat from them too.\n\n Very tough chicken, but it's very healthy chicken.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nChickens eat high meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n That's what they do best with.\n\n Chickens are real nasty scavengers, so are ducks.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHave you heard of this stuff called smart chicken.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've heard of it, but I haven't looked into it yet?\n\n If they feed 'em mostly soy, it's the same garbage as y'know.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHow about Shelton.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShelton?\n\n Shelton is vegetarian, they're high in soy.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat about Coleman.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nColeman doesn't make chicken, only beef?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nIs it good beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's okay.\n\n\r\nYeah, they just go through their cycles.\n\n \r\nThat's why I like people to eat three meats: chicken, fish, and beef every day.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nThey won't do that, they will only eat one kind at a time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know, but that's only because they're not well animals.\n\n Out the wild, they would eat a bird in the morning, a rat in the afternoon and all kinds of different meats.\n\n\r\nBut if they had any vaccines they're not well.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, is that why they get back and forth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they should give variety?\n\n\r\nBut you know, if you let get spoiled and let them have their way, they're going to eat only what they want until they satiated with it and then they're going to go to the next and you have to figure out what it is that they're going to to like.\n\n But if you train em in the beginning, you're getting this meat in the morning, this is night, the next morning like this, and you rotate it, you know that's the way to do it cuz that's their natural diet.\n\n But they won't have any problems if they eat one meat for a long time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Asnd Filter \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI don't use anything, I use a sand filter in mine\n\n \r\nI have a Hayward sand filter.\n\n It's a three.\n\n I use a a swimming pool size filter, so I have to change it every five years, so it's 300 pounds of sand.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt could fit into a traditional size jacuzzi or we have to have it specially fitted or what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou'd have to have it specially fit because that filter is about this big and it keeps that water crystal clear?\n\n It won't stop algae, but I like the algae.\n\n I let algae grow in mine.\n\n I'll just scrape when it gets- the algae is like velvet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Avidin \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay\n\n If you read the new book, I talk about it in, it's in the old book, but the spell checker changed avidin to albumin.\n\n So, in this book, it's proper.\n\n \r\nEgg white has avidin, the egg yolk has biotin.\n\n \r\nThey're scientists that say the avidin binds with biotin and doesn't allow it to be utilized.\n\n \r\nIt's utilized in a toxic body by taking biocarbons, it neutralizes biocarbons and removes it from the body.\n\n**[biocarbons are from eating carbohydrates]**\n\r\nStop eating cooked foods so you don't have so many freaking biocarbons.\n\n So, you need to eat a lot of eggs because you got a lot of biocarbons.\n\n \r\nSo, the scientists are just looking at \"Gee, this happens.\n\n Let's not do that\".\n\n \r\nThey're not looking at, \"Yeah, this has a good function\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that's not causing it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n That's always heavy metals.\n\n It's usually a aluminum that cause.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Bacteria To Lungs From High Chicken \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHigh meat, especially chicken\n\n High chicken will help bring bacteria to the lungs.\n\n\r\nNo, you don't grind it.\n\n Chop it up.\n\n Let it get really stinky.\n\n Foul as can be.\n\n\r\nIt's just certain bacteria is growing faster than others, the stinky bacteria is growing faster.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI open the jar and I just want to throw up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's just a certain bacteria.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're actually inhaling bacteria when you smell it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, just the vapors from it?\n\n It's gas.\n\n\r\nIt's like you having a fart.\n\n I'm not eating you?\n\n\r\nIt's just your gas.\n\n So, that bacteria off gases, it farts and it creates that odor.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Car Exhaust Toxins \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRemember, anything that's made from a vegetable oil that's burned, that fat will harden quickly In the human body\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOne of the statements they make is that it burns up the CO2 s that it uses.\n\n Or, the plants feed off CO2's that it produces, it burns back up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're just talking about one element of the exhaust\r\nWhat about the other elements.\n\n The heavy metals, the exhaust contamination, they're just talking about one element?\n\n Iit's a big element, but that's just one element.\n\n The plants, they'll be fine.\n\n But will we.\n\n\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (9) Cocoa Nibs, Chocoal, Website and Book \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about raw unheated organic chocolate\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's fine?\n\n Cocoa beans, cocao nibs.\n\n \r\nI've got a chocolate recipe for that.\n\n I don't think it's in the book, but I make ice cream with it, like orange chocolate ice cream and that's fine.\n\n\r\nJust don't do it too often.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat's the recipe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou'll have to email me for it?\n\n I've got an orange ice cream and orange cheesecake, chocolate orange cheesecake.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDon't do it too often because what.\n\n What's too often?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it's still high in theobromine and caffeine?\n\n\r\nIt can cause irritability, cause diarrhea, it can cause hyperactivity if you have to often.\n\n But if you're making the chocolate the way I said in the book, if you let it ferment like I suggest, tastes like rum chocolate and I love rum chocolate.\n\n \r\nThe actual cocoa beans, raw cocoa beans.\n\n.\n\n\r\nIf you have it with the butter.\n\n If you make it the way I say to make it, that caffeine's not gonna be able to be released from the fat, nor will the theobromine and you get the taste of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat wasn't in your book though, was it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n This was something I created since- see, the coho beans weren't available at that time, and I wasn't finished with my two years experiments with it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan get that from you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I say, I'm going to email them to Cynthia and then you can get the recipe from her?\n\n \r\nThere's a website that will be released this week or next week where I've contracted with this to make my books available in electronic form, PDF format.\n\n So, you will be able to search the whole book on your computer instantly, so you don't have to go through pages, go through the index and look around.\n\n\r\nAlso on the website itself, all the information that I have published and not published will be on that website along with all the books.\n\n So, if you want to search one thing, then we will give you a whole list of hits come up like that of information on a disease or a particular thing or a particular subject.\n\n\r\nSo, you have all of my knowledge at your fingertips like that and I think subscription is only $80 a year or something like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow will we know about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm going to email it out next week?\n\n\r\nThey'll sell hardback books, but it's mainly for my books in the electronic form.\n\n I've contracted for them, that's their exclusive and to have all my information searchable on their website and it's, we want two, the two is the numeral to live.\n\n\r\nWeWant2Live and that's the website.\n\n You can go there and now and subscribe it's already ready.\n\n Just thatI haven't proofed it yet, and I was going to do that this week.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that means if somebody like was asking me about the mercury, and I've said that you've been to a laboratory and had the animals.\n\n.\n\nthat would be on that site.\n\n**[Aajonus],[never happened]**\n\r\nThat will not be on there until I finish the Detox Book \n cause that information's in the Detox Book?\n\n Well, it's everything that I can release that isn't part of the book because I can't release the information in the Detox Book because of my contract with the publisher.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it'll be in the book too though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it'll be in the book and the website once it's on the detox book, once the detox book is published, hopefully in the fall?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut what I was trying to get at is, and I think others were asking, the information that will be on the website will be more than the than that's in both books.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWill be extra.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n There'll be interviews.\n\n He has interviews on, ppeople have interviewed me, the information I've given them and their questions and answers.\n\n I have two years of question and answer sessions like we're having here that were all transcribed, they'll all go on the website, so that in the next six months, you're going to have a plethora of information.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf I go on there for a question, for instance, it's a research on where that information comes from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf I've given that, yeah, like in the book, what I've cited in the book, of course it will come up in the footnote or in the bibliography?\n\n\r\nYou're gonna have all that information at your hand without having to lead through a bunch of books and papers and pages.\n\n Will be like going to a electronic law library, which is a dream.\n\n \r\nBecause when I was studying law, word law and suing the city of Los Angeles, the police department, I mean, before they put all that stuff digitally, I would spend a week at the Law Library and get very little done.\n\n When they put all the law books on the websites of the universities, I was able to put the exact words that I wanted, I would'nt have to go read and read and look all through all this stuff.\n\n The hits would just come up like that.\n\n\r\nSo, I was able to write, you know documents in hours instead of weeks.\n\n \r\nSo, that way you'll have that information of and it'll keep building and also there's gonna be a newsletter that'll come out every two months giving new information.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Commercial Moisturizers, Cooked Food \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCommercial moisturizers are all chemicals\n\n They're not food, so they poison the cells.\n\n Remember, anything that's cooked has heavy metals and toxins in it, and you read the stearates and all that stuff, and you get online and you search out the side effects of those.\n\n They're pretty nasty.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, there's no lotion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere is no lotion that's raw, that you can buy in the store?\n\n You have to make your own.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre they're not allowed to make them raw anymore.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's illegal?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there anything that cooks with heavy metnals in it but they're not released.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSee, when you cook a food, the plants eat strychnine, the mercury, the lead, the iron, all of those elements, they make food of?\n\n They make biochemical substances and they're of value when they're in their proper ratios and they're connected with vitamins and proteins and minerals and enzymes, they're not a problem.\n\n\r\nBut once you cook the food, you fractionate all those bonds.\n\n So, then the metals are just like they are in the earth and they're poison.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Dog Raised On Raw Meat, Dogs Need Bones \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt may be a problem for 'em\n\n A friend of mine had a dog who raised from 10 weeks old on the raw foods and eating raw bones and this dog was 230 pounds.\n\n His head was this high, this big, and you know, those big femur joints on a cow, this big.\n\n\r\nYou put that in his mouth and he would just dissolve it, with one bite, just crumble it with one bite?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas that a young dog or an old dog.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that was when he got older?\n\n But I mean that he grew up on this diet from 10 weeks old, so he had really strong teeth.\n\n\r\nCan you imagine what he'd do to you if he did that.\n\n I'd be just mangled?\n\n Like a lion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen I give him raw meat, five seconds It's down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, gone.\n\n\r\nWell, it's cuz he needs bones.\n\n You have to have bones, dogs have to have bones.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, so one pound with meat a day and give him butter and egg occasionally.\n\n\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (12) Dont Forc Detox, Oysters For Metals \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you don't want to force detoxification of heavy metals with tremendous amounts of cilantro or anything like that, until you've been on the diet a year and a half minimum\n\n\r\nIf you want to detox heavy metals a little bit safer, then eat oysters almost every day, like six days a week with some.\n\n\r\nLike for you it would be a cup of beef with three oysters twice a day, and that'll help remove it more quickly, safely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Dont Require Ingredients In Well Water \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo, they absorb the toxicity in the water\n\n If you have well water, you don't have to worry about the milk, but it still helps soothe the skin as the poison minerals and toxins come out.\n\n That little bit of fat in there keeps the skin from being damaged and drying too much, coconut cream is helpful.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if the bath water is absorbing the toxins from the water, when you stand up and it coats your body, are you then putting the toxins on your skin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because it stays in the oil?\n\n Doesn't get reabsorbed into the skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou don't have to shower off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you don't want to?\n\n You don't want to shower off.\n\n \r\nWhat I suggest that you do is take a silk or a cotton cloth, and after you've been in there, right before you're ready to get out, or even while you're in there, after you know every 20 minutes, just wipe the dead skin off.\n\n\r\nAnd then when you get out, you might get all down to several layers of the dead skin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Dry Skin, Primal Facial Cody Care Ceam, Coconut Oil \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI just told you why the skin gets toxic\n\n Cuz poisons perspire out the body, so the skin's going to be dry for the rest of your life probably.\n\n So, you have to put some kind of lubrication on the outside.\n\n Primal Body Care Cream is always the best nutrient wise.\n\n That's on page 145, I believe it is, of The Recipe Book.\n\n Somebody's recorder just clicked off.\n\n No, Lorraine may.\n\n The Primal Body Care Cream is the best.\n\n That's in the one page, 145 on The Recipe Book.\n\n \r\nNext would be the coconut oil if you're getting it from James in Los Angeles, it's the Thailand coconut oil that's made by friend of mine, a patient of mine on Costa Maria Thailand, has made and been to the home of people who make it and watched it be made perfect.\n\n Also, on wildernessfamilynaturals.\n\n**[no longer made properly]**\n they carry a Philippine fermented coconut oil, and it's made the same as we make it in Ko Samui, but it's made in the Philippines now.\n\n \r\nHe used to allow the coconut and oil to reach about 105° - 110°.\n\n\r\nAfter talking with him for three months last year, he brought the level down to 96°.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that Wilderness family.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWildernessfamilynaturals?\n\ncom.\n\n Yeah, so that's the Philippine fermented coconut.\n\n They have other coconut oils, but that's the only one below temperature.\n\n \r\nJust rub it in and wipe off the excess after 20 minutes.\n\n Put it on very thinly and it goes a long way.\n\n You really don't need- that's pure oil\r\nIn the Primal Body Care Cream you've got nutrients to feed the skin, not just protective oil.\n\n\r\n When you ever have just a pure oil, it is more detoxifying, but it seals off the dry air, you'll lose less moisture in your skin, it won't dry, but it won't nutrifiy your skin like the Primal Body Care Cream.\n\n \r\nAlternating one day with the primal facial the next day with the coconut oil.\n\n That's a good way to do it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Electronic Chlorinator \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nElectronic chlorinators work off of turning salt into chlorine, chlorine that doesn't have a chloroform vapor and those are fine\n\n \r\nI will swim in those every day if I had that.\n\n \r\nIf you put salt in the water, they've got an electronic field that sends a signal through the water and it turns salt into a more natural chlorine that does not have chloroform vapor and just use sea salt if you're going to do that.\n\n \r\nThose are good for swimming pools or you know, small pools.\n\n If you're using something like that, it's fine, but if you know you've got a lot of chemicals in the water, you're still going to need something to chelate with those chemicals if you're using in city water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow about doing showers or baths with city water.\n\n Same thing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSame thing?\n\n I would never take a shower, I always take baths.\n\n When I was living in the city and having the city water, I always took baths only every two, three days and always put my milk, my vinegar, and my sea salt in the water.\n\n\r\nI found that putting 2 - 3 tablespoons of coconut cream in there really makes the skin nice.\n\n That's what I would use now if I had to do that, but I have my own well.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Exercise Isnt Enough For Lymphatic Congestion \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay, take your body temperature and you may get up to 99\n\n5°.\n\n You've got to hit 101°, so that water temperature has to be minimum of 101° - 105°, and you have to keep it at that.\n\n So, you have to let the water out about every 15 - 20 minutes, some of it, about three inches of it, put scolding hot water in, and also the mixture that I suggest: the milk and the vinegar and the sea salt in there, or epsom salt in the water.\n\n So, they'll help pull out the toxins and uh, keep the water warmer for a longer period of time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you ever go hotter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou just can't stay in it that long if you go really hot, you just can't stay in it?\n\n People are out in 35, 45 minutes if they get it too hot.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long should you stay in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt should be 45 minutes - 1?\n\n5 hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've gone in for two hours, just a few nights ago.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but the water cools so much.\n\n\r\nOh, so you have like a jacuzzi.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but I mean, I just got it out and fell asleep again for another 20 minutes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I see.\n\n You just kept waking two hours.\n\n \r\nYeah.\n\n It's great.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Feeding Dogs Raw \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a dog that's 13 and he's in good health\n\n I, I feed him a raw meat in between the meals and I'm starting to put raw meat in with his crunchies, breakfast and dinner.\n\n What else should I be doing this.\n\n Because he's not good, he's pretty healthy?\n\n \r\nShould be giving him anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wouldn't feed him anything, but?\n\n You know, a dog in the wild is a scavenger, but mainly they eat raw meat.\n\n That's their diet, raw bones.\n\n Is he a small dog or a large dog.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, he's 60 pounds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n60 pounds.\n\n Well, he should be eating red meat and bones.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I noticed the crunchies are wearing his teeth down, so I've been putting it in water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if he's already getting deterioration of his teeth, he's not in good health.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n You think he's, but he's not.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\nOnce they start losing their teeth and his teeth-\r\n\n\r\nNo, his teeth are fine, I see they start wearing down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a bad sign because all dogs in the wild don't wear down their teeth and they eat huge bones.\n\n Their teeth, their dentine, constantly regenerate.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe can barely get up.\n\n He has a hard time getting up.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI give him glucosamine twice a day.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nGive it to the vet, shove it up his butt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n He seems like he's getting up outta his teeth better, he seems like he's walking better?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe's not walking better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust give him the raw meat, the eggs, the honey and butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nInstead of the Crunchies.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe Crunchies and Gardens?\n\n That's not a dog food.\n\n\r\nThat's industrial food that tells you it's dog food.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nCan you just buy the regular beef instead of getting the good stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGet 'em the worst beef you can, I mean, not the, you should get them New Zealand, but get all the garbage pieces, all the stuff that they throw away?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAll the organs and everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll the stuff that they throw.\n\n I have people who have the dogs they go to these health food stores and say, give me about five pounds of your throwaway meat and fat.\n\n You get 'em for .\n\n50 cents a pound, a dollar a pound.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Fermented Foods, Hadza Eat Cooked Meat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I eat the fermented juice\n\n Anytime you want to get rid of anything in your body that you've eaten cooked, you eat it fermented.\n\n\r\nNow, Sally Fallon and a lot of those people that go for all this fermented foods, they continue to eat cooked foods.\n\n So yeah, they needed a lot of fermented.\n\n\r\nAnd only the tribes like the Hunzas, they eat cooked goat and they didn't eat much raw meat.\n\n They ate a lot of raw dairy, but they ate a lot of fermented foods to make up for their cooking.\n\n\r\nThey were living in a clean environment, so they didn't get a lot of disease because the other things that people normally cooked, they weren't eating cooked.\n\n But they were having the fermentation.\n\n \r\nSally Fallon said, \"Well that all that fermented food is better for you\".\n\n\r\nI said, \"Yeah, if you're a cooked food eater\", definitely.\n\n \r\nSo, as long as you eat cooked food, you need to eat a lot of fermented food.\n\n It should be a regular part of your diet and it'll help your digestion.\n\n**[Attendee],[Something about fermented vegetable juice],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, but I only suggest one a day if you're going to do that.\n\n The others are fresh.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Food Cravings, Eggs Dries Mouth Form Pulling Out Toxins \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAs long as you go with those cravings and you stay balanced, that's fine, but if it starts imbalancing you, it's not the way you should do it\n\n You should go against your instinct.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about the green juices.\n\n**[audio cuts out so not sure the question],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCause more hunger, they increase digestibility, they clean the system quicker?\n\n So.\n\n all of a sudden the body says, \"Oh, I feel better.\n\n I can eat more\".\n\n \r\nSomebody gave me an ostrich egg for Christmas.\n\n I didn't eat it until I got back for New Years.\n\n And there was five cups of egg in this one egg.\n\n Three cups of white and two cups of of yellow yolk.\n\n\r\nAnd I ate it in less than 24 hours.\n\n And I was still hungry.\n\n  Sometimes I'll make a shake with 24 eggs in it,  and that's two quarts about or right around a quart and a half depending on the size of the eggs and I'll still be hungry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what about doing it at night because we are supposed to eat every five hours.\n\n Cause I do raw eggs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow many eggs at a time because sometimes I get nausea.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends upon the person.\n\n Just keep eating them until you get really turned off I've eaten, like I say, I can eat a cup of eggs at a time and then all of a sudden I start getting nauseous.\n\n \r\nAnd usually a cup of eggs, if they're normal sized eggs, an egg is about a 1.\n\n5 oz - 2 oz,  depending upon the size of the medium egg.\n\n Some eggs, you get 3 oz out of the big eggs, so whatever it takes to make a cup and then that's all I can drink at a time is one cup.\n\n \r\nHowever, sometimes i've consumed up to two cups at a time no problem.\n\n Especially if I've eaten cheese first.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you always need to have honey/butter/cream with the eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n\r\nWell, it's just that egg tendency because it pulls out a lot of toxins to dry the mouth and lips.\n\n So, put honey on your lip or eat the honey and butter.\n\n\r\nThe cream is more alkanalizing.\n\n The butter is more acid.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Foreced Tapeworms For Constipation \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I forced myself to get a tapeworm on it and I had had constipation for 57 years\n\n Even on a raw diet, I'd move every day, but that first part of my bowel would be very dry and it would rip my rectum.\n\n And before I went on a raw food diet, I only went every 3 - 5 days and it would tear my rectum completely and there was always blood.\n\n I bled for 50 some years, and when I forced myself by eating the fermented milk with the mocha and the fermented sugar cane juice, I got a tapeworm from it.\n\n I kept the tapeworm for about three months, passed about 85 feet in two separate movements.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n85 foot long tapeworm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, 85 foot long?\n\n About 45 feet one time at 45 and 40 the other.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you didn't attempt to release it.\n\n It just?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it just- well, I got a craving for onions and I just ate a half of an onion in a sitting and said the hell am I doing?\n\n And the next morning that evacuated 45 feet of the tapeworm?\n\n\r\nI thought, oh shit, I worked all this long to get a parasite and here I knocked them out with the onion because I could smell 'em coming out with onion juice.\n\n  \r\nSo, but then I saw, a week later, I saw little sections coming out again here and there, and I said, okay, he's still around.\n\n So then about a month and a half later, I passed another 40 ft.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid it take care of your constipation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I haven't had constipation since?\n\n They never come out larger than, let's say that, instead of the size of my fist.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd what was the mechanism and why the tapeworm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTapeworm just changed the environment.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know?\n\n It's like Joel Westock, he gave the people with inflammatory bowel syndrome who'd been suffering from 10 to 32 years no mitigation from it and if you know anybody's had inflammatory bowels syndrome.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Gerenstar Coconut Cream For Sale \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMuch better than the one we were using at the moment\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the Green Star, this machine is 4?\n\n5 feet long, four feet high.\n\n It's like a Green Power juicer, but it's all stainless steel and big.\n\n\r\nAnd then there I bought a machine which can take the husk off of coconut in 10 seconds.\n\n \r\nThey trained me to do it and the people who make the machinery, they could do it in three seconds, do a whole coconut in three seconds.\n\n Shell it, and then there's a machine that grates it, and then the gratings go into the juicer.\n\n\r\nSo, we'll have coconut cream available again.\n\n Probably even a better quality because we're not gonna let any moldy coconut get into the mix as the other company did.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, the products that we get here, you order on Friday for the first Friday the month, and they come the next Tuesday, so that will be among them.\n\n We get all the products from James, everything that's available up in LA, which is a lot of great products.\n\n You'll get the product list.\n\n If you're new on this list today, you'll get the product list that says everything that's available.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou always have the right price on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's always changing, so I can't keep up with the price list?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDon't worry.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Hair Testing \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAluminum usually won't cause welts like that\n\n You have to remember that from the time you have the hives, you have to wait at least a month to take that hair cuz that's what will be thrown off at that time.\n\n The new hair coming out, that will hold the key to what you were throwing off.\n\n But if you took a sample while you were going through the hives, you would not know what's being thrown off.\n\n\r\nJust remember, your hair's behind what's happening in your body, so you'll have to let the hair grow out for a month and then take that amount, shave it off.\n\n You'll let your hair grow long and you're gonna take a clip of it.\n\n Just remember that only that small section that relates to what grew at that time is going to give you the clue of what it was, what was involved.\n\n\r\nA lot of practitioners don't think, and they'll go take a whole clipping of hair and say, \"Oh, well you got a lot of mercury\".\n\n Well, you're talking about, did it happen last month.\n\n Did it happen this month?\n\n Did it happened six months ago?\n\n So, they don't give you a good picture of the cycles in your body?\n\n\r\nIf you're having a problem now, they're basing the past analysis of what your body was throwing off in your hair from a different time.\n\n So, they're not giving a proper analysis, giving improper diagnosis, and then giving improper resolution for it.\n\n But the problem is by the time your hair grows out, it's too late.\n\n\r\nYou've got to know a remedy for what's going on with the actual.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Heavy Metals Leave Through Mouth From Brain \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen those heavy metals leave the brain where most of it them are contained, they leave through the mouth, the gums, the lips, the tongue, the salivary gland\n\n That's why people get dry mouth, it's not dehydration at all.\n\n It's that those heavy metals come through and out the mouth and the fats all from that area are pulled with those toxins to keep those toxins from damaging the body.\n\n So, that leaves dry lips and it's not dehydration.\n\n It has nothing to do with water.\n\n \r\nThe best thing to do is the oils in the honey absorb into the lips the best, so that keeps your lips from drying the best.\n\n\r\nBut as long as you have heavy coming out your salivary glands, you're gonna have problems on the sides of your mouth for those people who have the tendency to send a lot out the lips \r\nI do, so I've always had these scars on the side of my mouth.\n\n I don't have the sores I used to.\n\n I used to have constant sores on the side.\n\n I don't have sores, but I have the scars from it.\n\n**[Attendee],[Something about eyedrops or contacts],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's not a good thing to do.\n\n\r\nThimerosal, which is liquid mercury.\n\n All kinds of toxins.\n\n \r\nIt's still a chemical.\n\n They're using glycerin and stuff like that.\n\n It's all chemical.\n\n I mean, if you want to try to make a solution, take distilled water and take sea salt and put it in there and use that\r\n And what it is is take about a pinch of finally granulated sun dried sea salt in eight ounces of distilled water, or two grains of the heavier salt, sun dried sea salt.\n\n\r\nI just keep it in the for patients who come to wear contacts, I've got a little thing for them and I use that and I've had that solution last for over a year and a half without any problem.\n\n I put it in a small glass Perrier bottle.\n\n I don't leave it in plastic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Hives, Sugar Cane Detox, Penicillin \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf it's coming out at night, it's coming out of the nerves, and it's heavy metals of some kind\n\n It's causing welts.\n\n\r\nWell, when I forced the detoxification with the sugar cane juice, I had welts all over that.\n\nI refused to scratch them, yhey still turned into scabs.\n\n That's how toxic the substance was.\n\n \r\nSo, I took one scraping and took it to a lab.\n\n It only cost me $200.\n\n Here it's $2,300 - $3,200, the same lab test.\n\n \r\nSo, I had done there and I had byproducts of penicillin that had been injected into my rear end.\n\n So, all that was penecillin that was bound with a lot of sugar byproducts from all the sugar.\n\n I was a sugar hound cause I was diabetic.\n\n You know what sugar crisps are.\n\n I put four tablespoons of sugar in with my sugar crisps?\n\n \r\nI wasn't as bad as Hitler putting sugar on top of his cake,  and icing, but I was pretty bad and.\n\n \r\nSo, when I got all those injections, I had a lot of sugar products with it.\n\n So, when I ate the fermented sugarcane juice, it started a massive detoxification of that in the bones, in my hip bones, and my spine started getting very sore.\n\n \r\nI got these huge welts and I would take slices, cold slices outta the refrigerator, and I was in Vietnam at the time in hotels.\n\nI got stuck in my hotel for three just dealing with the itching, I took slices of cold tomato and rubbed them all over the spots.\n\n Then the next hour I would use cucumber and then I'd get into a bath with lots of salt, and tomato in there and soothe it.\n\n \r\nSo, every hour I had to do something to keep up with the intense itching, so I wouldn't scratch it, but still even without scratching they still scabbed over, that's how toxic it was.\n\n \r\nPenicillin is from a mold and you know what molds do to things.\n\n They eat it apart and they cause it to dry like the desert and that's what is happening to the skin as it is coming out through the skin?\n\n\r\nSo, those are the things I suggest.\n\n She just has to keep treating them every.\n\n Tomato, cucumber, and a tomato bath.\n\n Like I talk about in the book.\n\n \r\nThat's all external.\n\n \r\nInternal.\n\n It's the moisturizing/lube formula.\n\n Lots of eggs.\n\n\r\nBecause the eggs can help start pulling some of it through the intestines.\n\n I'm not sure that everybody wants that cause then it starts causing welts and that kind of scarring in the intestines and if somebody doesn't produce enough mucus, they're gonna have a problem.\n\n\r\nSo, if she has a normal, okay digestive system, doesn't have constipation, then she can eat a lot of eggs.\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWell, it's from the nerves if it's happening at night.\n\n \r\nHeavy metals could be metals that went along with antibiotics or vaccine cause they put mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde in 96% of the vaccines.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Is Primal Diet Sustainable \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd eating because you need cows for milk and cream and you need animals for meat\n\n I mean, do you think it's a sustainable as anything else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Can you imagine, look at all the fields where they grow rice, two-thirds of Thailand and Asia and Cambodia and Thailand and Malaysian, Indonesia is rice patties.\n\n \r\nWhen you take a cow, a cow can live off of the same land and feed more people, nourish them and make them healthier.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI didn't realize that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust figure this way.\n\n My family, my grandparents had a 55 acre farm, 40 milking cows, and about 200 sheep, about 1000 chickens, 4 Clydesdale horses, plus other horses, and grew corn on 35 acres.\n\n That fed all of those animals, all those animals all year round.\n\n So, there's a lot of propaganda out there about what is sustainable.\n\n\r\nPeople are making arguments, they don't know anything about farming.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Lung Infection, Eat Eggs, Fibrosis \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you have to understand, the infection is a good thing\n\n Whether it's bacterial, viral, or parasitical, they are there to break down the toxic tissue and remove it so the body can get rid of the waste product and rebuild it to new.\n\n \r\nSo, infection is always important.\n\n You just need to supply the body with the proper nutrients to make sure that the detoxification happens properly and that the nutrients are delivered so that the regeneration of the healing can occur.\n\n \r\nAnd if you've got a lung problem, eggs are the key.\n\n\r\nLots of eggs.\n\n\r\nIn fibrosis, that means the body is not tearing down the toxic tissue.\n\n The dead cells, it's mummifying them.\n\n So, they're hardening and getting thicker and thicker.\n\n You can't absorb oxygen in tissue like that and his lungs are turning into fibrosis.\n\n \r\nHe's not gonna live very long, unless he does the diet where he can get high bacteria, where he can have a lot of infection to break it down.\n\n\r\nStopping the infection just allows the fibrosis to get worse, quicker.\n\n Eggs, lots of eggs.\n\n Eggs and eggs.\n\n\r\nWell, how big is the person.\n\n \r\n175 pounds, 5' 10''?\n\n\r\nSo, you should be eating about 40 eggs a day.\n\n 40 - 45 eggs a day.\n\n And honey and butter if he'll take it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that should get him to a point where he can eat better maybe it is about three months?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Magnetic Bed \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, when I did experiments with those, I found that sleeping on the pad for about six weeks is okay, no more than five hours a night\n\n \r\nOtherwise, it starts pulling out too many heavy metals and too many toxins.\n\n It causes a high adrenaline and it makes you feel like you have more energy, but it causes massive toxicity in the system.\n\n\r\nS,o you're going to use those.\n\n You have to use them in small amounts.\n\n So small periods of time, if you're putting them on your back for a couple hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI slept on them for a couple years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're asking for trouble.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I did already.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey'll probably make the skin very poor and very dry cause most of this stuffs gonna come out the skin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Main With Ms Healed From Diet \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHis keeper used to have to rub him and he was completely crippled and he just shook and that was his life\n\n He just shook and they had to hand feed him.\n\n I put him on the diet and in six months he was jumping up and down off the couch.\n\n \r\nHis cataracts, he was completely blind from cataracts and deaf.\n\n\r\nIn six months, half of his cataracts were gone.\n\n He could see light and enough to see the doggy door and, and to go where he wanted to go in just six months.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas it from diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n From the diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat did he eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I gave him raw meat, egg, honey, and butter?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Nerves Run On Metals \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo, that's because of the toxins that are moving through the mouth, out the mouth\n\n \r\nAnd remember I've said that the nervous system and brain use more free radicals than any other part of the body.\n\n \r\nRemember, nerves function with electricity and light.\n\n \r\nWhat is a conductor of electricity and light.\n\n \r\nMetals?\n\n\r\nIron, mercury aluminum; all of those metals which are toxic when they're in a non bioactive form, meaning in a cooked form.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Over Cultivation \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, look what they did in Africa\n\n You take the whole north of Africa, it's a desert because Egypt over cultivated, cut down trees.\n\n So, Egypt had a whole north continent of Africa was their agricultural bed.\n\n It's a desert because of what they did.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're talking 2000 years ago.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, thousands of years ago?\n\n\r\n2,000 - 10,000 years ago.\n\n That was all lush.\n\n It was all lush, African lush territories there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere are those who would argue that if you eat beef, if we had to produce that we beef, which means to beef after the graze on land.\n\n How can that be sustainable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's if you're trying to get the cattle to craze unnaturally?\n\n\r\nYou let cattle graze on whatever, it grows, it's wonderful.\n\n Take a look at Hawaii.\n\n My God, the grass is grown as green as this, and the cattle don't need much room.\n\n You just graze tropical areas.\n\n Sure.\n\n You cut down forest, let me tell you.\n\n Those forests grow faster than then you could cut them.\n\n\r\nAt Pangaia, they have to cut back every day to keep that junk creeping into their growth area.\n\n So, that's a little off.\n\n But when you're clearing the land completely, taking out all trees and you use chemicals, you're going to erode the land and that's the problem.\n\n\r\nBut if you let grass grow and you've got cattle running around in a jungle, you've got that growing heavily.\n\n It's going to grow and grow and grow.\n\n It's not going to be a problem.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) People Only Eating High Meat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have people eating only high meats\n\n I have one guy, he was depressed all of his life, he started on the diet off and on, off and on, off and on cuz of his depression, his problems.\n\n He became alandscape artist so he wouldn't have to deal with people and after two years, he finally took of some of the high meat and he got so happy that he only eats high meat.\n\n\r\nHe won't eat any fresh meat, so he eats two pounds of high meat a day.\n\n You don't know anybody happier than this guy, and he doesn't have body odor nor does he have foul.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that would be really difficult *Laughs*?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut he eats that at home.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOutside the home even *laughs*.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan you eat that with your regular meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, you should eat it 10 to 15 minutes before your regular meat?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow could you make a palatable.\n\n I mean, I can't stand it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust put a nose clip on your nose, and you won't smell it.\n\n It melts in your mouth, it's so soft and tender.\n\n \r\nYou had never tried it, obviously.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI did try it.\n\n I've been on it for five years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know, but that doesn't tell me that you tried the high meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n On and off and off and off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMostly off.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut look, I'm healthy.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI left it six months in the fridge, do I have tt throw out and start over.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you don't have to throw it out?\n\n You just have to start opening it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Plant Growth From Aglae Urine and Eggshells \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe algae is like velvet, it's like laying on velvet\n\n So, it's like wonderful, but when it gets too long, I'll scrape it out and dump it.\n\n Use it in my garden.\n\n Boy does it make the plants grow, that and raw urine, the nitrogen in raw urine.\n\n \r\nYou should see a fern that I planted two years ago.\n\n\r\nIt was this small in a pot and with that algae and my urine and egg shells, it is now as big as that whole area over there of that garden.\n\n Just one fern.\n\n It's growing everywhere.\n\n And my roses are like this big, when they were originally this big, it really works.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, do you put milk in your jacuzzi or no.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n You don't need it because I got well water.\n\n But if I didn't have well water, I would put coconut cream in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about a cup of vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBe okay, fine?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Printers, Scanning Food \n \n \n \n \n### (34) Pure Eggs Diet \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut I only put people on pure raw egg diets when they have a severe digestion problem or allergies with foods\n\n\r\nNo, it has enzymes, it's just they're detoxifying enzymes.\n\n Yeah, you can drink it and I do that as a part of the detox, that's going into the detox book, so have one a day if you want, and that helps you detox all the cooked vegetable fats that you eating, helps to break them down, the vegetable oils that you've eaten in your lifetime from eating your cooked vegetables that your parents made you eat.\n\n\r\nIf you didn't like em like me.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Skin Last Thing To Heal, Asian Peole Shrivel Up At 50 \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\n Well, you have to understand that most of the toxins leave through the skin, so the skin's gonna take the brunt for a long time, so it'll probably be the last thing to repair and heal\n\n However, there's some people whose skin is very important to their body and they look like miracles, within months of starting the diet.\n\n\r\nI mean, especially the Polynesian and the asian men and women, they start eating this diet and my God, their skin is just phenomenal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, a lot of them have it genetically.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you see them in their 40s and 50s and they're all just shriveled up badly.\n\n They age faster than any other culture, when they're in their youth before they hit 40, no lines anywhere but boy, you know when they hit their mid late 40s, they just shrivel up like a raisin, but they go on this diet that pops right back out pretty quickly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan your skin  get better as we get older.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, definitely?\n\n It is already.\n\n I don't have all that breakout anymore and the lines here are getting lighter.\n\n\r\nFour years ago, I had about 12 layers of skin here.\n\n Now I only have about six, so it's half of what it was.\n\n\r\nWhen I lived outdoors as a vegetarian, traveling on a bicycle, I looked like those Indians.\n\n I was dark skinned and had this thick skin.\n\n It was wrinkled all over, and eventually it dissolved and went away.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre wrinkles toxins.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's toxins that are buried in the skin, and the skin has killed the cells and mummified the cells, so it's like leather?\n\n A lot of the cells aren't alive.\n\n You get layers of them.\n\n \r\nYou're supposed to have only three layers of skin.\n\n The older you get, the thicker your skin gets often, unless you're doing laser surgery or peels and acid burns, keep taking the layers off.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought old people get that little transparent, that their skin gets thinner and that wrinkles are the skin being thin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's when you get up into your sixties.\n\n Then it goes the other way.\n\n Your body starts eating its own protein because people of that age stop digesting proteins and assimilating cooked proteins.\n\n So, then they start eating their own bodies.\n\n So, then the skin gets thinner and thinner and thinner.\n\n The body starts eating the bones, so they get osteoporosis.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd why is that again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause they stopped digesting food, so the body eats itself?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou mean cooked foods.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n The intestine stopped digesting cooked food.\n\n Eat raw food, and it changes\r\nMine was down to here after the poison mushroom, mine went like this.\n\n I have been experimenting with some people now with that they're putting saliva and honey on their necks and it's working very well.\n\n \r\nI tried mixing the honey with water, it denatures it, but the saliva doesn't, and you have ptyalin enzyme in the saliva, which helps break down sugars, so for proper absorption.\n\n\r\nSo, that's probably another reason it facilitates honey and that way you can put it on so thinly your face isn't sticky all day, just for maybe an hour.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFall asleep and the ants will get you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's funny, with the saliva in the honey, the ants don't bother it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, but I tried some of that.\n\n The problem was the ants got around the honey, you know.\n\n Next to the bed?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I'm talking about over your body, not the honey next to the bed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo what percentage saliva.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n50 50, maybe a little bit more saliva than honey, and it also keeps the lips from dry?\n\n Very wonderful.\n\n Better than butter, any of it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Slowing Down Detox, Bath Formula \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI see in your book you talked about slowing down a detoxification and you talked about a bath\n\n\r\nDo you recommend me doing the baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the baths, you have to understand that we eaten vegetable oils?\n\n Most of what we eat is the vegetable oils because of the propaganda, margarine, and all that garbage.\n\n \r\nPropaganda was that hardening of the arteries and the heart hardening of tissue came from cooked animal fats from animal fats, get off of animal fats, have margarine and vegetable oils.\n\n\r\nWell, your vegetable oils, especially your hydrogenated oils, crystallize.\n\n Hydrogenated vegetable oils are the same molecular structure as plastic.\n\n That's how plastic is made.\n\n So, it's absolute bullshit what they've been telling us.\n\n Vegetable oils cause hardening of the arteries.\n\n Humans body temperature is about 98.\n\n6° or lower.\n\n\r\nHerbivores who eat vegetables with vegetable oils have body temperature about 101°.\n\n We will not stay that warm.\n\n So, vegetable oils in the human body have a tendency to dry out at lower temperatures and crystallize, and that's what causes hardening of the arteries and hearts and multiple sclerosis a, along with iodine and a lot of other problems.\n\n\r\nBut it's vegetable oils that's the culprit.\n\n\r\nTo get that to melt in the body to be, dissolve it from the lymphatic system and discharge it from the body, it takes heat.\n\n So, you have to get in the bath, stay a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour and a half, take a walk afterwards, about a 45 minute walk.\n\n\r\nBefore you get in the bath, like I say in the book, you have pineapple, coconut cream, and, and drink that mixture with a little bit of butter and cream too, dairy cream.\n\n You drink that before you get in it, right as you get in.\n\n \r\nThen you take the 45 minute walk and you're going to feel as limp as a noodle and not feel like taking any walk when you get out of that bath.\n\n\r\nSo, you move very, very slowly because the blood sugar will be very low cuz you melted that stuff and started perspiring out of the body.\n\n So, the blood sugar's gonna be very low, so you have to move in slow motion out of that bathtub onto the toilet seat, or a chair.\n\n It shouldn't be far from the bath.\n\n You dry yourself, slowly bundle up in very warm clotheslike you're going out to the snow to stay very warm for your walk, and you take a very mild 45 minute walk.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Sunglasses and Vit D, Sun Is Okay Wit Hgood Fats \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI would say if it's causing you headaches or severe problems, then you use sunglasses\n\n\r\nSun gazing and all of that, yeah.\n\n Vitamin D is very helpful for the eyes.\n\n Keeps them young and alive.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes the sun causes cataracts or anything like that in the long run.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Well, as long as you have good fats in the body, the sun causes the oils, the fats in the skin to transform into vitamin D, including the cornea and in the retina.\n\n So, it aids the body, but if you don't have good fats, let's say you're full of vegetable oils and you don't have any good animal fats in the body.\n\n\r\nIt can cause a cancer, cataracts, glaucoma can cause all kinds of problems.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan cataracts reverse.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've seen them reverse on this diet in animal, and human?\n\n\r\n I had a pug that was given to me.\n\n He had MS couldn't even stand up or walk, couldn't even have a bowel mover or urinate on his own.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Sustainability \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the sustainable one is so primitive\n\n It has no cars, it has no tv, it has no electricity.\n\n That's perfect the way the natives live.\n\n That is perfectly ecological.\n\n But the way I'm gonna run the health center, we're going to have hydro power, we're gonna have sun solar power.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNuclear energy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* no nuclear energy?\n\n\r\nThe machines will be oiled with coconut oil, everything will be electric that's powered by the sun and hydro.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about biofuels like biodiesel and ethanol.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey still have toxic vapors and they still have heavy metals there, so they're still very clear?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about peanut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a vegetable oil, It will harden in our systems?\n\n It'll cause hardening of the lungs a joke.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Sweat Ldoge, Sauna \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFrom burning the ashes and the herbs and burning the rocks\n\n Ehen I do sweat lodges, I lay back flat on the floor, flat on the ground, and you got a 12 inch to 16 inch layer of good air that stays there, and the smoke doesn't come down below that, it just seals it.\n\n\r\nSo, I'm down there breathing at the side, everybody's up there in that smoke and the steam and suffering.\n\n I'm down there on the ground enjoying the better air, but still it doesn't get as hot there, so it's not as much sweating.\n\n \r\nSteam baths, the problem is you got the steam that goes and burns the mucus membranes.\n\n So, that causes blisters and all kinds of problems, thins the mucus too much.\n\n \r\nSaunas are too dry, they burn the mucus membranes all the way down the system.\n\n And because it's dry when you perspire, the toxins that come out with the first iteration get dried right into the skin.\n\n So, if you do saunas, you have to go out every three minutes and rinse off thoroughly and then come back in.\n\n\r\nAnd you can't get the body heated up deeply into the lypmh system in the connective tissue, unless you stay in that heat for 45 minutes to an hour and a half.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n[Saunas and firemen.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they were drinking a lot and discarding a lot, but they weren't on a good diet and eventually, you know, their skin would've been worse, but they got better internally, but their skin would not get better, nor there sinuses.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Tapeworm For Ibs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo matter what they eat, even if it's water\n\n They get cramping, severe pain and diarrhea all the time.\n\n They live with it every day, every time they eat or drink anything, so it's a miserable disease.\n\n \r\nAnd he gave them the whipworm from the pig, five days later, no digestive problems like that.\n\n All the symptoms went away, not even on a raw diet.\n\n They didn't change their diet.\n\n \r\nDrank a whip worm in gatorade, which the Gatorade neutralized the hydrochloric acid, so it didn't destroy the eggs.\n\n So the eggs incubated.\n\n They got the whip worm and resolved all their problems.\n\n Of course, they were back five, six months later asking for more worms cuz they started having problems again cause they didn't change their diet.\n\n\r\nBut how does it work.\n\n Who knows?\n\n There were eight scientists who came out with a report last year that followed up on his work, and they did it for, I think it was 11 years.\n\n They did the research on it, and they found that the whipworm produces three chemicals that prevent brain tumors and pancreatic tumors and a whole plethora of chemicals that protect the body and make the environment good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, why can't they isolate those and just give you those chemicals rather than have those worms.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not infectious to other people?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that's all bullshit?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when do you recommend them to people.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnytime you want?\n\n But it's hard on a raw diet, it's hard to get them past the hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, if it's a high alkanalizing environment that they need to be put in, see, I never thought of that.\n\n I put 'em in an alkaline fluid, but I never thought of putting the vegetable juice or something like that to alkanalizing the hydrochloric acid.\n\n So, probably be a good idea to eat some cheese first if you want to create a parasite.\n\n I have some people doing it now with some pigs intestines to get the whipworm and one of them did it about two months ago.\n\n \r\nSo, I had him eat the cheese and then eat the intestine with some with some vegetable juice to alkanize his system, so he has no intestinal problems within a week after eating them.\n\n\r\nAnd another man who's 62 years old, who I've been working with for six years on the diet, like me he's had the constipation problem.\n\n I got him to get in touch with that person who had the pigs intestine.\n\n He said ever since he ate that, hasn't had constipation.\n\n Just like that, eating it one time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre you gonna market it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's against the law?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, I'm sure it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe small intestine.\n\n Not the large intestine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWouldn't the health department have a field day with that.\n\n Because they're so absolutely paranoid about trichinosis?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIsolate trichinosis and sell it *laughs*.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, Joel Weinstock did.\n\n\r\nHe knows how to do it.\n\n So, if you want to know how he does it and set up your own pharmaceutical to do it, you're just gonna have to do it underground.\n\n Joel Weinstock is at Iowa University.\n\n It's in the book, the Recipe Book, and it quotes what he found in that experiment was six people.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut that brings up a good point for new people, just when you can't talk about this guy with people, cause they go freak out.\n\n You tell 'em anything like this, they're gonna gp report you to the agency.\n\n Your relatives think you're crazy, your friends think you're crazy?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't care.\n\n I have the health.\n\n They don't, so I don't give a shit.\n\n And if they say, \"Oh, you're gonna get sick and die\".\n\n I've been doing this for how long now I'm healthy and you're not.\n\n That tells me everything.\n\n As long as I die healthfully, I don't care.\n\n Doesn't matter how many years I live, it's that I live healthfully.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Travel Foods \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen I travel, I always take my honey butter and cheese, that's all\n\n Because I can always get eggs and raw meat wherever I go.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if you go long without green juice.\n\n I can't go long without it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nyeah, I can't go long without it.\n\n I can usually get vegetable juice, there are health food stores that make it, or I've got clients or friends that I make it for me while I'm traveling.\n\n In Bangkok, I get sugarcane juice, fresh, fresh juice, Cambodia, they make it right on the street.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you don't have the green juice can you get too acid.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can get too acid?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Vinegar Neutralizes Chlorine, Hot Tub Setup \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you're using regular city water, you need something\n\n \r\nI used to go to those deprivation tanks and boy, they've got salt and chlorine galore.\n\n So, I take a bottle of vinegar and I'd dump it in there.\n\n Cause I'd go for, you know, six, eight hours at a time.\n\n And they'd even say, \"Boy, you're really rank.\n\n It smelled like some kind of acid shit there\".\n\n\r\nI said, \"Well, you clean them out every so often anyways, so clean it out after I get out\" because I don't tell 'em I put vinegar in it.\n\n Cause I don't wanna get in all that chlorinated water and the vinegar neutralizes chlorine.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, if you go to a friend's house, you bring your vinegar and dump it in\r\n\n\r\nWell, when I used to go to swimming pools, I would do that.\n\n I would take a couple of cups.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, if you're neutralizing it, then the stuff's gonna start growing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, vinegar stops that from growing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you could just use vinegar maybe.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but it could dry your skin a little bit?\n\n\r\nSo, you might want to put some coconut cream in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you could just use regular water, city water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIif you're using a sand filter and vinegar, you'll be fine?\n\n You just have to neutralize the poisons in the city water.\n\n \r\nLA has 192 chemicals in the water, San Diego's 168 chemicals in the water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, to neutralize the chemicals in the water, the vinegar alone would do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt will help?\n\n That's why when you want to neutralize them completely, you need a high calcium and other minerals, and that's what comes with the milk.\n\n Or if you don't want to use that for your jacuzzi, you could use epsom salt and vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, does the sand filter have to be in the jacuzzi or can you fit it outside.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFit it on the outside?\n\n I got my jacuzzi, it's 10 feet in diameter.\n\n It's concrete, poured concrete, and I keep it, there's a center section, there's a seat level and a lot of people are in it, but when it's just me I go in it every day, almost every day when I'm in town.\n\n\r\nI just keep it only just above the seat level, so I'm down in the center section, which is about,  five foot diameter.\n\n So, the heating bill isn't high and I can heat the thing in an hour instead of six, seven hours if I've got it full because it's about a 500 gallon jacuzzi if it's full, but 14 people can fit in it.\n\n\r\nWhen it's small, three, four people can fit in it comfortabley when I have it on the low level.\n\n\r\nLet's say the jacuzzi here, my whole filter system and heater are in a separate house that was built probably 45 feet away from the jacuzzi itself, and I keep mine outdoors.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Weight Loss, You Will Look Thin, But Be Fat \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm getting too fat, but I love it\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the cream will put on more weight than anything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I'm doing exactly what you're telling me to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Yeah.\n\n Well, just cut down everything by maybe a tablespoon at a time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've been doing that.\n\n \r\nWe'll just cut it down a little bit more, you know, ratio everything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long do you think I need to have it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRest of your life?\n\n I will never stop drinking milk and cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI wanna get back to a size 8.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't care.\n\n It's not healthy.\n\n Its how good you feel now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI feel wonderful.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, keep it.\n\n Who cares what you look like.\n\n\r\nYou look good.\n\n Who wants to be skinny and unhappy.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWell, I was skinny and unhealthy, but now I'm fatter?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd happy and healthier.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'd still like to be down to a size 8.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you've been on the diet as long as I have you'll be skinny.\n\n Maybe 30 years.\n\n \r\nWell, you didn't have chemo and radiation, you may do it in 15, 20 years or less, who knows.\n\n \r\nLike I said, the one woman that's only been on the diet 14 years, she's thin now.\n\n She's very thin, thinner than I am, but she carries 22%- 24% body fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo I still need the cream with the milk cause I know less cream in milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can cut it down as long as you're not comfortable with your weight, but if you start dropping weight, then I would say add it back?\n\n Because you're in the perfect weight right now for health.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI weight more more than I ever was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're in the perfect weight for good health.\n\n Enjoy it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nStay with the cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, stay with your weight?\n\n\r\nYou can cut out the cream and just drink the milk if you keep gaining.\n\n But right now you don't need to gain anymore, you're the perfect weight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) What To Feed Dogs, Bones \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanted to ask you about my dog\n\n What about this flea stuff I was putting on every month, and the heartworm stuff.\n\n\r\nCause I saw a man whose dog died of heartworm when I lived in Florida.\n\n He didn't give him the heartworm thing and the dog died.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's probably what killed him.\n\n\r\nA lot of these vets will say, \"Oh, your dog died of heartworm\".\n\n And they didn't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, don't give 'em heartworm, don't give 'em flee stuff.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all toxic stuff?\n\n \r\nIf you feed 'em right, they don't have flees.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So much of the protein should I give him each day.\n\n He's 55 pounds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou've got several dogs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOne dog?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOne dog.\n\n He needs about a pound of meat a day if he's indoors.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I take him for a walk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's nothing.\n\n He lives out in the backyard and he runs around all the time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's like an old dog, he doesn't run, he walks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA very sedentary dog.\n\n Pound a day will be fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that will be all his nutrients.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, you need to give him a little butter and egg once in a while?\n\n But he's gonna need a lot of bones.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat kind of bones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nChicken?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI always thought chicken bones splinter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, if they're cooked.\n\n They turn brittle and then the acids don't melt it.\n\n \r\nAll dogs eat all bones in the wild, that's what they live on.\n\n They eat more bones than anything else.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, raw bones.\n\n So, I have to go to a butcher and get bones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr you get chicken parts with the bones in them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd those bones will not splinter.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nGet a whole chicken and take out the breast for yourself and give the bones for your dogs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I used to, that's what I feed the coyotes.\n\n I eat the legs, they get the breast.\n\n \r\nI give them the neck and all that other stuff.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

do 'em.\n\n Do you intuitively listen to that.\n\n Cause you said once, you shouldn't do 'em every day?\n\n You should do 'em every other day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n 90 minute ones you don't do every day.\n\n You do the 40 minute ones every day.\n\n\r\nYou do the 90 minute ones, two days a week.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that consistently throughout your detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThroughout 40 years of your life?\n\n The reason I like that is cause when the people who've done it, and I've seen it in the last week again in New Jersey when I've seen patients there, those who did it even for only six months continuously did the baths, the astounding look of their skin and in the iris where their skin is and all the lymphatic fog that was there gone.\n\n Not the lymphatic congestion, but all that stuff that was stored in their connective tissue gone.\n\n Six months to a year.\n\n And before I was watching that take 15 to 20 years, so there's a huge difference.\n\n\r\nThis diet can't do everything because of the chemical structure of our industrial pollution.\n\n And when you've got hydrogenated vegetable oils clogging up the body, there's no way that our diet can do it only.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe bathtub that you sit on uhhuh, it seems that's very good for this.\n\n It's much easier to hold the heat and also the amount of water.\n\n It's not that much as a big tub.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n It would work better, but most people aren't used to getting into a slim cylinder.\n\n But those work very well, they also conserve space.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you know where to get them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I only know three people that have them, and I didn't ask them where they got, but you go on the internet, you'll find it?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Something]**\n\r\n\n Japanese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, Japanese, because they had the Hiroshima and Nakai bombs, they had to take care of themselves much more than any other race.\n\n They had to get through all of that, so it became a science how to survive.\n\n We found that the clay, the raw fish, maintain life better, help get rid of the radiation poisoning.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, those will help the radiation now that we're having.\n\nout of the BA would be one?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep, so it doesn't get there where like the glands would be secreting constantly, perspiring to make sure you're helping the lymphatic system because if it can't get to the lymphatic system, it's gonna store somewhere else.\n\n\r\nIn the liver, in the pancreas, in the thyroid, it's gonna store somewhere where there's fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThen you wanna have your smoothie too, right.\n\n While you're having your bath?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the pineapple pineapple smoothie is important for the 60 to 90 minute bath, but not so important for the short bath?\n\n\r\nEvery day and a hot tub is always the best cuz you have a constant temperature.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Body Fat, Cooked Fat \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI like everybody to be overweight and I'm on the thin side right now because I just spent four months traveling and I can't get all the foods that I want, but I'm still 18% body fat\n\n Most athletes who have this kind of muscle structure, and they exercise, and I don't are about 7% - 8% body fat, 10% at the most.\n\n\r\nI'm 18% body fat.\n\n That's because on a raw diet, raw fats are very small.\n\n When you cook them, they swell anywhere from 5 - 50 times their normal size.\n\n If I were eating cooked foods, I would be quite overweight looking, but I am 18% body fat, but look thin and I haven't eaten cooked fats since 1972.\n\n\r\nBeen a long time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Injections, Hot Baths \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust now coming to a point of detoxing all of it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat happened two years ago.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI was abducted?\n\n I talked against the swine flu vaccine on national radio.\n\n I created a cold campaign against it because I was in the swine flu fiasco of 1976.\n\n I got death threats and everything and six weeks after that, I was in the Philippines and abducted in a hotel room and given three shots.\n\n\r\nAnd I got very sick.\n\n I got sores bigger than this.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShots.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, injections?\n\n Scar here, here and another one here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe shots for what.\n\n You don't know?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI imagine they were swine flu because on the radio I said the only way you can get swine flu is to get the swine flu shot and a rap group in the famous rap group in England heard my broadcast, so they made a million dollar video within a week?\n\n I mean, it was very complex and they had my voice in there several times throughout it.\n\n And one of 'em is saying, you cannot get the swine flu without getting the swine flu vaccine.\n\n\r\nI just think they wanted to give me the swine fluid and say, see, he got swine fluid and he died, but I didn't die.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if somebody gets skin tags a lot, the body's putting toxins, something that move it out a little away.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n Dead cells.\n\n Cancer is always a collection of dead cells because your body can't dissolve the dead cells.\n\n\r\nLymphatic system's too jammed or your liver.\n\n 90% of the cancers that I've seen, it was also a liver problem, where the liver was not making the bile to digest the fats properly, so the lymph system could dissolve cells, and the body was so toxic that bacteria and parasites and fungus couldn't break down those dead cells because they were poisoned to death by some industrial chemical.\n\n\r\nSo cancer's nothing more then the body's inability to dissolve dead cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, what if it's just skin cancer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's cancer?\n\n A wart, a mole is a tumor.\n\n They're all tumors.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo take the baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, to keep things moving out of the body, so they don't back up and collect?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Aajonus Teeth Procedures \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA dentist that will do what you want do without x-rays, you won't find it in the United States\n\n You won't find it.\n\n You have to go to Mexico.\n\n I use Dr.\n\n Thomas Britton in Mexico.\n\n He does exactly what I want, even if he doesn't agree.\n\n And when I have a filling pop out, I have him scrape off the epoxy.\n\n\r\nHe's not allowed to drill anymore and he'll fill it in and my teeth had started regenerating.\n\n So, I have a filling that's filled like this, and as my tubule and dentine fills in, it pushes out the filling and then the filling pops off.\n\n So, I've got new growth, if I haven't drill 'em out, it's gonna go to that same size again.\n\n\r\nSo, for the past 10 years, I haven't allowed him to do that.\n\n**[big], is now this big [small]**\n.\n\n So, I don't let him drill anymore.\n\n I only let him scrape off the old epoxy and any black mold that might be there because the mold is there to break down the toxicity there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo where do I find his address.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe's in Mexico, he's in Tijuana?\n\n Thomas Birtton, you'll find him on the internet.\n\n\r\nYou have to go further east of Tijuana to get to there.\n\n They've got too many military men with machine guns, so they don't mess with them there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you just go through the border.\n\n A taxi?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I drive through?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI think you have to park on the American side and then you walk through.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's if you wanna walk and take a taxi, I drive through.\n\n You just have to have your passport.\n\n \r\nI've gone over there for six years now and never had a problem.\n\n\r\nThey love Americans to take their money over there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow's the price.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's like one third of what you pay here or half of what you pay here?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nFor one tooth flipper, I saw holistic dentist here in LA and It was a thousand dollars.\n\n These two teeth, and it looks very real, $80.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe only charged you $80.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nFor this?\n\n It's the flipper though.\n\n I can take it in and out.\n\n It's plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n But he charged me for a flipper.\n\n He charged me $300.\n\n\r\nYou're too pretty.\n\n \r\nWhen I wanted to have it done in LA, they wanted $100 and he charged me $300.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI just wonder if he doesn't X-ray, how can see inside what's happening.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe doesn't get to see inside.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, sometimes I wait with cavities.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You can wait and see and if they're not getting bigger, then don't worry about it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat Romi guy that wrote the book Heal Your Teeth or Heel Tooth Decay, I have that book and he's basically talks about the diet and if you're on this diet that it will fill up naturally, like it will heal itself naturally, cavities.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but it takes years, I had to be on the diet 15 years before it started making a difference in my teeth, but I had radiation and chemo and surgeries.\n\n So, it may have been just that, but I don't know.\n\n That I haven't studied thoroughly with other people.\n\n Just my own situation, my own case.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe mentions your, diet kindly in his first book, but in the second edition, he takes it out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat does he say in the second.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe just doesn't say anything about it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n That's fine.\n\n Because he says in the first, he doesn't have to say it in the second.\n\n Oh, you mean the second edition, he removed it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I'm almost positive cuz it wasn't there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't think so.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Adrenaline Surges At Night \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I was wondering with regards to people who have the adrenaline surges or adrenaline rushes, especially at night that cause weird insomnia\n\n In your experience, what is the best way to try to manage that just as people in minimizing that and to sleep through the night.\n\n I mean, you're talking about somebody who works during the day and to then get up in the middle of the night and prepare some cooked rice?\n\n You know what I'm saying.\n\n So, what is your experience with that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I use many different things now cause it's a difficult adrenaline?\n\n One little pin prick of adrenaline can allow you to lift a car.\n\n\r\nSo, it's so concentrated and you've got a toxic adrenaline running, it takes a lot of nutrients to bind with it and neutralize it.\n\n So now I suggest that people use the nut formula first and foremost, cheese regularly, like every 30 minutes they're going through it, and also clay and milk.\n\n Clay and milk works wonder for helping to sleep and it will work all through the night as will cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust putting a little bit of clay with the milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You take a tablespoon of the moist clay and you mix that with 2 - 4 ounces of raw milk and it tastes a little like chocolate milk if you're using the terramin clay.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you do this before you go to bed or is this what you do when you wake up?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo it before you go to bed?\n\n I would say in the evening, if you go to sleep at 10 - 10:30, you should have it around 7:30, so it's already starting to rip the stuff out, and it takes 24 hours to move substances through the human body.\n\n So, it takes 19 hours to get to the bowel, and then five hours to clear the bowel.\n\n\r\nSometimes it'll hold onto it even longer, called constipation.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Caffine \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow bad is caffeine for you\n\n Like, whether it's coffee or tea or one of those things?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's a stimulant and it's a high metallic one because you cook it and you fractionat it.\n\n The component of caffeine is like some parts mercury, some parts lead, some parts  arsenic.\n\n So, it's a toxin and that's what stimulates the nervous system and they don't tell you that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's interesting.\n\n Really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep?\n\n So, when you cook it, you make it into a very toxic substance and it irritates the nervous system.\n\n It poisons the nervous system, and the nervous system tries to resist, so it makes the whole body hyper.\n\n**[unclear]**\n a lot, so I had to act like I'm drinking coffee and they actually serve coffee, hot coffee.\n\n So, I put it up in my mouth, I'd just throw my tongue and spit it right back out.\n\n I would get so buzzed from just touching my tongue.\n\n I would stand there and be shaking from it, so I had to learn to put it up to my lips and down again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd why do some people feel better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause, they have chronic fatigue and it gives them a little energy?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI came from a country where people drink 6, 7, 8 esspressos a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Well, this country does it.\n\n I drank 11 cups a day.\n\n I had no energy, I was chronically fatigued.\n\n I was taking benzodrine, I was drinking 11 cups of coffee a day and smoking two packs of non-filtered lucky strikes daily for my energy.\n\n Then I couldn't sleep at night, so I drank a fifth of gin or bourbon.\n\n I ended up with an ulcer.\n\n It was so big I was vomiting a cup of blood at a time.\n\n\r\nSo, those weren't healthy ways to stimulate yourself.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow about tea.\n\n No?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTea's also a toxin?\n\n There's caffeine in a lot of them, a lot of heavy metals in it.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nCan you detox from caffeine with the nut formula.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll help because you have the starches in there, the bind with the caffeine, but I think that the clay and the milk work a little bit better and the cheeses?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Cauterized Clay \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot the terramin clay, I've just started with all this, so I've been using zeoalite for some time\n\n I just wondered what you have to say about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nZeolite is not really that good.\n\n It's not really a clay that isn't processed.\n\n I like the clay from the Mojave desert, the terramin.\n\n\r\nIt's from an old aqua bed, thermal aqua bed, and they mine it where it's never reached over 98°.\n\n So, the phosphorus is contained and when you get a clay from a volcano bed, what happens in a volcano.\n\n You got temperatures of 1900° - 3,200°, what is burned off in gas?\n\n All of the alkalinizing minerals, all you left electric molten metals?\n\n\r\nWho the hell wants clay from molten metals.\n\n Doesn't make a fricking bit of sense to me, even though new algae and processors are going through, breaking it down?\n\n I don't want heavy metals in any form, I'll feed 'em to plants.\n\n That's okay.\n\n They can handle them, they can eat them, but I can't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo if I wanted to get some clay, I just go online and ask.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTerramin?\n\ncom and that'll take you cal goodearthstore.\n\ncom something like that and you order it there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can get it from Jackie Brothers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's probably cheaper to get it right from the source?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Cheese, Cheese and Honey, Weight Gain \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCheese\n\n You have cheese every 30 - 45 minutes to an hour.\n\n You're gonna have it in there from the time you go to sleep all the way through that 19 hour trip through the body collecting poison as long as it's raw, no salt, cheese, and you don't eat honey with that cheese.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you eat honey with the cheese, you'll digest it and reabsorb your poisons?\n\n\r\nYou eat honey with the cheese twice daily.\n\n For people who are very underweight, they can eat it more, but you make sure that's separate from where you have the cheese to detox.\n\n So, I usually recommend that people have cheese and honey together 35 minutes after they finished their meat meals.\n\n \r\nHave anywhere from 1 - 2 tablespoons.\n\n If they were a big person, it would be 3 - 4 tablespoons with a tiny bit of honey.\n\n 1/6th - 1/12th.\n\n So, let's say you had one tablespoon of  cheese, the maximum would be one teaspoon of honey.\n\n That's one third, but I recommend even less.\n\n I recommend one tablespoon cheese - 1/2 teaspoon of honey.\n\n\r\nUnless somebody has a huge depletion of mineral enzymes in their bodies.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI find raw cheese very constipating.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Chlorine In Water, Chemicals In Water, LA Water \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIn a bath you have to keep warming it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey just started fluoridating San Diego tap water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI thought you got that stopped again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, they, they finally did it.\n\n It's just as bad as you can imagine it.\n\n So, to make a long story short, of course now San Diegos are contending with this and those of us who had the foresight to get whole house, water filtered systems and so forth have less of it, but it's not, you can't get it all out that way, unless you have a whole house reverse osmosis system, which is virtually impossible for the average person to have one that really works.\n\n And so love to hear your thoughts on this.\n\n I spent quite a bit of money to get a a new porcelain tub to be able to do these and then they- I mean, seriously.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, yeah.\n\n In LA we've had fluoride for 25 years and we've got 197 chemicals in our water because the water is used in,it's that place way up on the hill, uh, in the mountains there.\n\n.\n\n\r\nAnyway, there's a township up there that uses it first, then the valley uses it and the valley's nothing but industry and then we get it third hand, so very, very toxic.\n\n I always put milk in the water, vinegar, and the formulas in the book in We Want To Live under baths, under health modalities.\n\n\r\nSo, I put about a 3/4 cup of milk in there, raw milk, of course and about 3-4 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar and about two heaping tablespoons of sea salt or epsom salt.\n\n And then if you want to make your skin nice and supple and keep it from drying out, from being in there so long when you get out, you put about 2 - 3 tablespoons of coconut cream in there and it just skims the top, and as soon as you get out it just coats you very evenly and nicely.\n\n \r\nSo, that's what I used to neutralize any poisons in the water, you could also throw some clay in there, especially now that we have the threat of nuclear fallout.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's in the water now too.\n\n So, that's gonna neutralize the fluorides in the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt neutralizes any of those poisons?\n\n All of those poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much terrmain clay do you put in the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI put about two tablespoons?\n\n\r\nTwo tablespoons per tub, 30 gallon tub dry.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOnly thing about that is you have to let it sit before you drain it for about two hours to settle or else it will clog up the pipes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Colon Bacteria, Suppository \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you need to do that suppository\n\n You have to understand, Michael, the bacteria in the colon gets the scum of whatevers left and it's not healthy, it's not that good.\n\n So, they're getting predigested this, toxic that, everything in the colon that goes through theirs, they're getting whatever's left, the dredges.\n\n\r\nPlus all the toxins that are moving through the intestinal tract and out the intestinal tract, the cheese helps mitigate that.\n\n However, the body is absorbing all the best fats through the small intestine, the bowels not getting much.\n\n \r\nSo, I suggest that people take three tablespoons each of.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n butter\r\ndairy cream\r\ncoconut cream\r\n1/4 teaspoon of honey\r\n\r\nMix it all together in a four ounce jelly jar, and then you do this right before you go to sleep and you immerse in a bowl of hot water for about four minutes, hot enough to make your hand uncomfortable, but not burn it for four seconds.\n\n Then take a bulb syringe and then stick that in your rectum and you're going to feed that E.\n\ncoli in the bacteria from the back end.\n\n\r\nIt no longer will hold up your fecal matter trying to get every particle it can.\n\n That's not true constipation, that's deficiency.\n\n \r\nSo, the best way to do it is you get down on your knees on a bed or the floor.\n\n In the bed you could tilt and cause yourself to squirt in the wrong direction.\n\n So, it's better to get off the solid surface like the floor and then stick it in this way or this way, whatever's comfortable.\n\n\r\nBut get down after you put it in and roll your stomach like a belly dancer, so you get it to move up the descending colon.\n\n Then you lay on lie on your right side and you can lift your leg and roll your stomach like a belly dancer again, and to get it to move up the transverse colon, you're gonna be feeding those bacteria.\n\n\r\nYou're gonna sleep better.\n\n You're not going to hold onto the fecal matter forever and you may only have to do it once every once a week.\n\n Some people like Michael may have to do it every three days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's butter, dairy cream, is it coconut cream too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut cream?\n\n Three tablespoons of each.\n\n\r\nYou can do it without the coconut cream, but the coconut cream helps move things a little faster and don't let it out of the body.\n\n Keep it in all night.\n\n You let those E.\n\ncoli, the other colon bacteria eat.\n\n They're starving.\n\n**[Micheal]**\n\r\nYeah, it came out all over my carseat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, did you do what I said.\n\n Did you roll your stomach?\n\n Did you lie in your right side?\n\n**[Micheal]**\n\r\nNo, I didn't do that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou left it in the sigmoid colon.\n\n Try it again doing it that way or not.\n\n It's up to you, Michael.\n\n \r\nShe asked about an adrenaline problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how do you determine if you're having an adrenaline problem.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you can't sleep you're hyperactive?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I'm only laughing cause I have these problems.\n\n Feels like someone's got a gun to your head.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI would say, well you're on the thin side up here.\n\n\r\nYou gain good weight and I like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n Well, I need to get rid of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo you don't.\n\n No, you're perfect here.\n\n You're safe the way you are.\n\n Your skin is looking better, everything's looking better.\n\n You're not half as dry as you used to be.\n\n You're still very dry, so you're not getting enough nutrient fats to the system, to the skin, cuz your insides were all dry and they're using it up faster it can get to the skin, so you need to feed your skin from the outside too.\n\n Bone marrows the best, so just rub bone marrow and go to North Star Bison, order some bone marrow out of the bone.\n\n You're gonna pay for shipping of the bone and it's gonna be expensive.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Constipation \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut that's when the body is trying to get all the nutrients out of the feces that it can, and it's really not true constipation\n\n True constipation is when you've got a block in your intestines, in your large intestines, and nothing's moving.\n\n Not just because your bacteria is holding fecal matter up in the sigmoid colon to get every digested thing it can out of it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cooking Releases Radiation \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWel,l always look at this picture first\n\n When you cook something, you fractionate everything and you release a radioactive material that will be damaging and harmful.\n\n\r\nWhen it is bound in other nutrients, it is neutralized to a great extent, so they cook the pig, they got big problems if it's high in radiation.\n\n \r\nIf you don't cook the pig and eat it raw, most of it's going to be not storing your body and it's going to pass out of the body, either in the feces or in your urine, less in the urine, and your perspiration.\n\n So, it's not gonna get into the glands and areas like that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Dental Procedures \n \n \n \n \n### (14) Ear Clicking \n \n**[2011],[Joe]**\n\r\n\n\r\nClicking in my ears\n\n Usually it starts in the evening.\n\n I think it's associated with wax build up in there, but how do I get rid of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if it has a good beat, Jazz Club?\n\n Clicking in the ear usually means that the ear is opening and expanding and contracting and expanding and contracting constantly and that causes the click.\n\n \r\nIf you have a wax buildup inside, it'll make the clicking sound as it opens and closes.\n\n Because it's wax, it'll stick together and click like that.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nWhy is it doing that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour ear's probably going through in and out of detoxification or there's poor circulation into it and all the pulsing doesn't always make it?\n\n\r\nSo, what you do is put a hot water bottle against that ear at night and sleep with it and that'll help melt the wax and also increase circulation.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nWhat about laying like this in the hot water bath for a while.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat'll be helpful, but you need it for many, many hours?\n\n The ear drop is sunken deep into the head, so what happens is the circulation and heat getting into it you'd have to have your head underwater for at least 90 minutes.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nI was able to get a lot of wax out by doing that.\n\n Just going with the finger.\n\n I got an incredible amount, it was so plugged with wax that I could hardly hear out of this ear.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you wanna get the wax out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, definitely?\n\n The wax is like mucus.\n\n If it gets toxic, you need to remove it.\n\n You need to put heat, allow it to dissolve, soften, and run out.\n\n And it's just like a bees wax.\n\n Once you hit a temperature of about 100°, it's gonna get thin and start moving.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what it's done in the hot bath.\n\n Is it a bad idea to have a ear/nose/throat, doctor take it out with a little spoon instrument to do it with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can do it yourself cuz they'll put a chemical on it.\n\n They'll put wood alcohol or something on it to put in your ear.\n\n They always medicate everything.\n\n Medication's, poison all the time.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Eggs, Milkshakes For Mcuus \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI should probably do more baths\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you have to understand, anybody who has an allergy is not making proper mucus.\n\n If you look at mucus under a high powered electronic microscope, it'll look like layers of cloth, one on top of another.\n\n The more layers, the thicker and the stronger, if the mesh is wide open and not tight in the weaving then particles will pass through, get to the mucus membranes and irritate them and that's what allergies are.\n\n \r\nSo, you're not building your mucus properly yet, and milkshakes is the best way to build it and of course, eating enough protein.\n\n\r\nI had a, a patient in South Africa to set up my lecture tour there.\n\n He's on a diet doing greatly, but he's staying away from mucus forming foods to deal with his allergies and I said it's just the opposite,You need to build the mucus.\n\n So, he started eating 2-3 milkshakes a day, and then two days he had over 50% relief.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know there's some days I get a lot of coming out.\n\n If not, then I get tight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen you need the milkshakes right away.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou need to eat one or two every day when you have your kind of condition, don't let it dry out.\n\n Don't let yourself get mucus deficient, because if your body's using it as an expiratory point, you've got to have more mucus to replace it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you have to do the milkshakes.\n\n Can you just drink the milk and eggs and stuff separately?\n\n Does that have the same thing?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, it will not do the same?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYou gotta have it together.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou have to have it together, yes.\n\n And with a cream in it too.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, if I have a lot of phlegm coming out, then I'm doing fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're doing great cuz you're getting the poisons out of the body?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCause I have asthma too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's one way you expel it, secreting it.\n\n 90% is supposed to go out the skin and perspiration.\n\n That's why you do the hot baths every day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Emf In Car and Emf Pillow \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow what I did for my Prius and any car, they all have a very high electromagnetic field\n\n \r\nI took inch round magnets and made them in three centrifugal circles and I spaced them an inch apart all the way around, positive, north, south, north, south, north, south, all the way around.\n\n \r\nSo, what it does is it repels, so it doesn't allow any frequency to stay steady and I have that between two down pillows and I sit on that in my car when I used to drive down here, when I first got the prius, that's a hybrid car with electric and gas.\n\n My legs used to ache, I mean ache, especially back here with this foot on the pedal and the highest amount of electromagnetic field is at that gas pedal, like it can get up to 75 - 80 milligals, back away it's 8 - 13 depending upon if it's running on electric or gas.\n\n So, I made this pillow, now I never have a problem.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Emfs In Cars \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why I won't use a cell phone next to my head, I absolutely won't do it\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And you have like a tube, but I couldn't find anything like that on the internet, but smart and safe.\n\n Closest to airless.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're air, they're not airless.\n\n They're just air.\n\n I have no wire in it at all.\n\n The wire comes up in here.\n\n There's no wire, in mine there's no wires.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWho makes it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDr?\n\n Cola has one.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that's got wire.\n\n It has aair tube from here to here then it has wire.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, well I got that one and it didn't work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what I did with that one, I went online to a security company that sells for CIA and the military and for security and all they have the white spiraling tube.\n\n And I added that to the blue, so I had it way down her, instead of just to here.\n\n I didn't want it near my thyroid and I didn't want it anywhere, around my neck, so I just put an extension on.\n\n what's this one in Israeli.\n\n And it, uh, has two.\n\n\r\nSo, what I have now is a tube that's just pure air and it's this long, and I just clip it to where the speaker is and it takes the sound into the air tube.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou made that yourself though, it's no manufacturing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I bought it in Thailand?\n\n Go to thaiorganiclife.\n\ncom, they're very cheap.\n\n I think I paid $23 for it, which beats Mercola's $35 one.\n\n Yeah, tie organic life.\n\ncom.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you made it even longer.\n\n You put an extra.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, no, no.\n\n\r\nThat was on the Mercola one.\n\n I'll get it and I'll show you.\n\n \r\nIt's nothing but a tube, and there's a piece that I lost on here that helps stick onto the back, but here's my mic.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Emfs In Phones \n \n \n \n \n### (19) Essential Oils, Toxins Go Into Hair and Nails \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about essential oils, are they any good or are they all toxic\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll essential oils are distilled at 267° if they're youngs?\n\n And even young even says in his book, nature does it from 52° - 67°, not 267°.\n\n Just because he's 200° lower than everybody else doesn't make it a good oil.\n\n\r\nIt is a solvent when it's distilled at that temperature and eats right into a cell, a cell doesn't have a choice.\n\n It's like gasoline or kerosene.\n\n\r\nYou put the oil in and you would have to somehow let it sit and ferment until the oil separated.\n\n Then again, any kind of an oil separation is gonna be more solvent reactive, cleanser.\n\n It isn't like butter or cream, which stabilize and strengthen the body.\n\n  it will be act as a cleanser.\n\n\r\nNow most people are full of plastic wax fats, so when they use the distilled oils, it goes in there and breaks them down, but the byproduct is very toxic, so they may feel better because now their lymph system and other things are flowing and maybe they're perspiring now in their neck or wherever they're using them or in their sinuses, but it will start at some point within a few months of using it to deteriorate your tissue, dissolve them.\n\n\r\nWhat happens if you use 'em for 10, 15 years and you've got mucus membranes that are all scar tissue.\n\n Then it happens in the lungs, what's gonna happen if you can't absorb oxygen.\n\n You're gonna be a vegetable?\n\n\r\nMost people put it on their neck and also it'll start breaking down all the lymphatic congestion in the lymph, but it doesn't do it safely.\n\n\r\nYeah, it'll dissolve them.\n\n It'll definitely do that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNot dissolve.\n\n It allows the nail to become normal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it stops the detoxing of heavy metals, it causes the warped toenails.\n\n I'd rather have warped toenails for a while and let it remove from my body.\n\n Of course, if you start doing the hot bath, you're gonna eliminate a lot of it, and then we won't have to build it into the nails and hair.\n\n\r\nBut I'd much prefer gnarly nails than have the poisons remain in my body, heavy metals.\n\n \r\nAfter I got abducted and injected with those, I started having all kinds, still I have all kinds of detox.\n\n This is all numb, completely numb here.\n\n Can barely feel anything.\n\n Very thick pads, when it happened, you see how thick that is.\n\n That's a third of what it was?\n\n I used to take a knife and just peel them off.\n\n I mean that thick.\n\n I would peel the pads off.\n\n I'm now ready to do it again in this area.\n\n After that, and this is some of that.\n\n This is a cancer tumor that came about, and I got them all over my feet about two months ago.\n\n And you can see I got rid of all of them, except for this one.\n\n And this one's starting dissolve, but I have to soak it in hot water for a couple of hours every few days just to keep it from going hard again and it's starting to get hard again right now, so I gotta soak it, but you can see all the damage and see what it did to the nails.\n\n I had perfect feet.\n\n Everybody used to admire my feet, nails were perfect.\n\n They're not perfect anymore, but they're getting better.\n\n This one was this thick, this one was this thick.\n\n\r\nAnd it's just your body builds toxic metals into the hair and nails, so it just went nuts.\n\n Now this one's starting to become normal.\n\n This one is starting to become normal again, all of these are normal except for this one and this one and this one, but they're all gnarling since the two years ago when it happened.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Facebook Can Use Your Info \n

said they were farm raised.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n In farming with oysters and clams and scallops, it's in the ocean.\n\n All they do is fence off an area and they break off and replant them.\n\n They're still getting fed from the ocean, they don't get any supplement.\n\n They have to call that farming though, because it's manned organized.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Fish Aajonus

fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou won't eat salmon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\nI stopped eating salmon two years ago cuz every time I ate it I got sick and they're lying like a rug.\n\n The salmon industry with Monsanto and they're GMO genetically modified fish.\n\n They released it over 15 years ago to the wild.\n\n Every time I eat salmon, even if it's from good waters, I get sick, so I stopped eating it about three years ago.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, ahi tuna.\n\n is that an okay fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's deep?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Flu, Colds \n

cuz they use heat and they use a solvent to extract it and they use a kerosene derivative.\n\n So, what you did was poison your body.\n\n Antibiotics and medications poison the body to stop the symptom.\n\n\r\nSo, you've got a symptom there because you've got toxicity in a particular area doing damage, that is why you detox.\n\n If you stop that, you're not remedying the problem.\n\n You're adding poisons to the problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI was so desperate.\n\n I I thought that was because of flu.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to read about it in my newsletters cuz that's a

long time?\n\n I just can't get 'em.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you're taking the hot baths regularly, you won't have to do it cuz you're already taking care of it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have the phlegm coming out, I think that's my detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's your detox.\n\n Your mucus is taking the poison.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n So the flu is unusual for me, so I thought it was- I was not used to it, that I didn't know how to deal with that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou do the same way you take it out with the mucus, you have to eat the food to build mucus like

Hours Without Eating Causes Tiredness \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI've got the recipes in the book, the remedies\n\n The vinegar and the lemon juice and the olive oil and stuff like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI also feel very tired in the morning when I get up.\n\n I don't have like energy or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's a lot of things you need to read in my books cuz you're asking a lot of questions that are answered.\n\n She asked, she said, I don't feel energy in the morning.\n\n She feels very tired.\n\n It's mainly because people sleep over five hours without eating.\n\n They go five hours without eating, the protein level, and the blood completely drops to nil.\n\n\r\nSo, the red blood cells become cannibalistic and eat each other.\n\n So, if you sleep 8 - 10 hours, you're gonna lose 1 - 2 tablespoons of red blood cells.\n\n That's anemia.\n\n And it may take the spleen anywhere from 40 minutes to two hours to replace that one to two tablespoons.\n\n So for the first two hours of your day, you're going to have anemia.\n\n\r\nIf you will awaken and eat and then go back to sleep, you won't have that problem.\n\n An egg or milkshake or milk or meat.\n\n Whichever you like.\n\n Just if you eat meat in the middle of the night, you might get too much energy, milkshake is more relaxing.\n\n Milk is also relaxing.\n\n Yes.\n\n Lisa.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nJust something I wanted to bring up, not really a question, but I didn't know, are you aware that there's a Primal Diet group on Facebook that actually a roommate of mine that saw you once a few years ago started, Lisa Foxworth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm aware of it.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nWell, they were dialoguing back and forth yesterday and they throw a question out and then a bunch of people answer.\n\n But my thought about, and my concern was that if they answer the questions wrong and then like they got in this whole thing about essential oils yesterday, and then one lady goes, well, but some essentials are good because click on this link.\n\n\r\nAnd I wrote down, the thing is you gotta ask Aajonus and he researched it, you're talking about his diet.\n\n So, I mean if you're not gonna follow that information by him, then how is that  Primal Diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNothing I can control about it?\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nDoes that really matter because they put your pictures in there.\n\n It looks like it's from you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, then they need to put an address up there and say, \"People who give information are not doing it from Aajonus\", unless they're quoting from the books.\n\n Do you know that person still.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then tell her she needs to put, was it a women.\n\n**[Lisa],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWe had a discussion about it, it makes it look like it's your-\r\n\n\r\nNo, they can't do that, if they're using the Primal Diet, I have that trademarked and they can't do that?\n\n So, if she's gonna use it with my permission, she has to put there, the advice you get on this is from other people and other thoughts.\n\n They're not Aajonus's.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Hernia \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYes, two questions, but the first one really, it's kind of funny, but when I sit a certain way, I put on shoes or whatnot, and I've experienced this several times, more than twice\n\n Something pops out of my belly here.\n\n I don't know what it is.\n\n It actually pops out and it hurts, and then I massage it, it goes back in again.\n\n\r\nI don't know what it is.\n\n Do you know it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a hernia?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that what it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a hernia?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it means I have a hernia.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you have a hernia?\n\n Probably an intestinal hernia.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n So what's going on with that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, a hernia is an area that will not heal and seal?\n\n And it's always because there's some kind of industrial toxin there.\n\n Could have been from a vaccine, it could have been from a long round of antibiotics that got lodged in that part of that part of the body.\n\n Whether it's a hernia, genital hernia, or a hidal hernia, or an intestinal hernia, it doesn't heal, there are toxins there.\n\n You have to get those removed and if it's in the intestines, it's difficult.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I mean, it's up here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, that could still be intestinal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, your small intestines cover this whole area and then your bowel comes across here, so that looks like it's either bowel or right at the end of the small intestine?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan it dissolve or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, like I say, you have to remove the toxins that are there?\n\n Without looking in your eyes, the next time we have a consult, I can take a look there and see what is causing it and what you need to take to be able to remove that particular type of toxin to remove that.\n\n Whether it's mercury or iodine, or a fungus or an antibiotic .\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I was telling Fred on the way over here, it's a very large lump.\n\n It was very high, about a year and a half on my back, hard.\n\n Pretty high and raised, and it started to get a little reddish.\n\n I started to put hot compresses, the hot water bottle.\n\n It started to get more red.\n\n It started to soften and flatten and soften and flatten, it's completely gone.\n\n Completely gone.\n\n It was really hard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have lymph glands all over the body, and they're normally about this size and then you have nodes which are very small, like the size of a BB all over.\n\n Now the lymph system is the only immune system, but we shouldn't think of as an immune system because the body was not set up to be defensive.\n\n\r\nIt was set up to be progressive and into maintenance, cleanse out the body.\n\n So, the lymphatic system is responsible for cleaning anything in the body and dissolving dead cells and eliminating them.\n\n So, if you get lumps, no matter where they are, and it gets larger and larger and hard, that means some pretty waxy fats, hardened fats are getting into that one lymphatic gland and it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n Heat's the only way to dissolve it and make it liquid again, to help remove it.\n\n Then it moves through the skin most of the time.\n\n 90% of toxins are supposed to move through the skin, so that's what the redness was.\n\n They were starting to move out your skin.\n\n\r\nThen when the toxins are neutralized and move out the skin, then the body can take that lypmh somewhere else and lymph is about 80% fat with several varieties of cholesterol, about 30 that can dissolve and neutralize all kinds of different substances.\n\n So, that's how that worked.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Hot Bath Depth \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, to the nose\n\n If you have a snorkel, you fit your entire head under.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut let's say you do just have it up to your waist or something, are you still getting benefits on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n In the lower part.\n\n Just remember you've got your main lymph glands here and here and here.\n\n That's your main lymph glands, those would need to be under your water the most.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you do one part at a time and another part a different day.\n\n You focus on them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that'll work, but you know, it won't work as well.\n\n Immersing the torso under is best.\n\n Even if you have just the water up to here, you're still gonna get all these glands.\n\n Maybe not these up in here, but you're gonna get most of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven if you had to have your feet out of the water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou've got glands up to here?\n\n But like I said, if you cross your legs like this, there's plenty of room in a small tub.\n\n I do it all the time.\n\n  People are saying, I have to lift my legs out if I get down in.\n\n I say, well, you're not crossing your legs like this.\n\n It's easy.\n\n \r\nWhen the knees go under, everything goes under.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAll that skin that you have under loose under your arms.\n\n Is that all just congested, lymphatic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, not only that, you're not dissolving dead skin?\n\n You've got so many poisons.\n\n Now, after I got those shots.\n\n First time, see that skin.\n\n I've never had skin like that and it also dropped here?\n\n\r\nNow, since I started this heavy detox two months ago, all of that skin that was sagging here is now gone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBecause of the bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, well I went to a hot springs when this started coming out and I lived in the hot springs.\n\n I was in there eight hours a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhich hot spring.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPhilippines?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas that American people or American or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, well, they look Caucasian?\n\nDefinitely, yeah.\n\n\r\nBut it tells all about the episode in one of my newsletters of last year.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Hot Baths For Vegetable Oils, Lympoh \n \n \n \n \n### (29) Hot Brain \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat with a constant temperature without getting in and out\n\n That is because the brain heats up and the brain does not like to be heated over about 102°, becomes very uncomfortable.\n\n\r\n So, get a bowl of cold water with ice cubes floating in it and a washcloth, and don't ring it out completely and put it on the top of your head and let that cold water just drip and within a minute with that on your head, you're gonna be fine in that water and you'll be able to stay in there for hours.\n\n \r\nIt takes a direct heavy cooling of the brain.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Japan Eats Ra Wmeats \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo any kind of nuclear fallout you have to do what the Japanese do\n\n You eat lots of raw sushi or raw meats.\n\n It doesn't have to be fish, just raw meats and lots of raw foods.\n\n They eat a lot of raw foods.\n\n They'll even have orange with their their sashimi meals, slice of orange at the end in Japan.\n\n They have mostly raw food.\n\n They're the only country in the world that mostly eats raw foods, besides the Massai tribes, the Samburu, Fulani, and the Eskimo.\n\n \r\nOf course, they're eating sprouts and they're eating seaweeds and stuff like that.\n\n They're very difficult to eat, but still they're not putting so much contamination in their body from cooked foods that allow those toxic substances to infiltrate and do damage in their body.\n\n\r\nEven though not on the best diet like the Messai, the Samburu, Fulani and Eskimo used to be before they were ruined by Great Britain.\n\n And we've ruined Eskimos and Great Britain has ruined all of Africa and those s tribes.\n\n\r\nSo, the point is you can protect yourself more with the raw food.\n\n Cooking will damage you in more ways than one now that we have all this radioactive contamination.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith the Japanese, what are they doing besides the raw fish.\n\n Are they eating your seaweed product or is that contaminated there too?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, of course it's going be contaminated now, but Japanese are between a rock and a hard place?\n\n The US government's gonna destroy him them.\n\n They were coming out with a car that ran on water this year.\n\n It's been ruined.\n\n It's over.\n\n It's not happening.\n\n Tthey were purposely ruined because.\n\n That country will never survive now cause you can't stop the China syndrome.\n\n It's too late.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Lymphatic System Is The Immune System, Doctors Moeny ,cancer \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, the lymphatic system is the immune system\n\n You hear about the phantom immune system that the medical profession talks about.\n\n It's phantom because it makes you stupid.\n\n They are already stupid.\n\n There is no phantom immune system.\n\n They talk about this antibody and that antibody and all this.\n\n It's all the lymphatic system, which includes the white blood cells.\n\n \r\nWhite blood cells are identical to how the lymphatic system operates.\n\n Those are phagocytes that eat up toxins.\n\n Your body uses fats to dissolve toxins and to isolate them and to neutralize them along with good alkalinizing minerals.\n\n\r\nThen dissolving, your body may use arsenic and the very toxic substances when they're above trace level, but they may use it in a solvent to dissolve toxic matter that's too toxic for bacteria, parasites, or fungus to eat.\n\n Those are our normal detoxifiers.\n\n \r\nNow, that's not an immune thing.\n\n That is natural process of decomposition and recycling.\n\n So, don't fall for this immune system stuff.\n\n It'll make you crazy and put you in fear, and then you go take their killing drugs, like antibiotics.\n\n It's an insane practice.\n\n \r\nThese are very bright minds that are made stupid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWe can use our own heavy metals in our body to detoxify.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n We can use them in making solvents.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd is that why sometimes when you detox you get rid of more metals.\n\n It's also metal poisoning at the same time cause sometimes you can taste it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n If it's a flu, if it's a cold, that's mainly bacteria, but if you have a flu, you're going to use toxic compounds to help dissolve tissue really.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhatever you got available *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nThey always tell you that these antibodies like attach themselves to bacteria or viruses.\n\n Is that completely false?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to understand that you've got attachments that take place, unnatural attachments all the time, especially when you're eating cooked food and toxic food?\n\n Let's say, when you cook a starch, now normally everything is combined in a healthful unit even if we can't digest it, there's a healthful, non-toxic unit to it.\n\n Once it's cooked starches fractionate, fats fractionate, proteins fractionate and then they have an affinity to clump together, certain pairs and certain communities will bind together and none of them are alive.\n\n None of them are active.\n\n\r\nIt's just a reaction.\n\n Like magnets are not alive, but they will attract certain metallic minerasl and attach to them and hang on to them.\n\n Well, all of your minerals have a electromagnetic field, so they will attract certain substances.\n\n \r\nThe medical profession, the pharmaceutical house is a big one that's responsible for all this research.\n\n They identify that as, \"Oh, this is what's happening.\n\n That's what's happening\".\n\n They give you a false impression of what.\n\n If they said, the truth of it is if you eat raw foods, you wouldn't have all your problems, don't take any medications, and you wouldn't have most of your problems.\n\n If they said that they wouldn't be in business, but they don't say that, and that's exactly the truth.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, we shouldn't be eating cookes starches.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUh, you need to read my books more thoroughly.\n\n I talk about it in the books rather extensively.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo, the purpose of antibodies isn't really to go after bacteria or viruses, like what you said before, they really go after the toxins.\n\n\r\nDo I understand that right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they go after waste products and toxins that may form from the waste products if the body's not removing them properly?\n\n But mostly it's because industrial toxin, you've got 60,000 chemicals that are now used in food and that's supposed to be safe, a shelf life of a hundred years on a cereal.\n\n\r\nHello.\n\n \r\nIf it doesn't decompose in the box, it's not gonna decompose in me?\n\n It's a no-brainer.\n\n \r\nSo, you have to understand that doctors, even though they talk all this chemistry, are really stupid.\n\n And you have to understand, they are stupid.\n\n And there's no niceness about it, they are stupid.\n\n They are leading people to hurt themselves out of bullshit chemistry.\n\n \r\nBut see if they just take the time and stop trying to make 20 grand a day or 60 or 80 grand a day with surgeries, if they just take the time to observe what they're doing they would learn, but they're so interested in making money.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean, if they repeat this across the nation, hundreds of thousands of times a year, and with the same results and they can't see that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n It's absurd, but you have to take a look at it.\n\n For every cancer patient they make about $280,000, big business.\n\n Let the cancer come on.\n\n They want cancer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey did it with my mom in 1965 and they're still doing the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey did it to me in 68, and back then it cost 160 grand for me to go through all their crap and I've made them eat 80 grand.\n\n\r\nThey took me 80 grand of my money.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Mountain Lake&spring Fish, Catifsh, Aajonus Eats Cheese and Clay With Milk Often \n \n**[2011],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOr mountain lake fish\n\n**[Aajonus],[Fred]**\n\r\nWell, as long as it's pure and not around-\r\n\n\r\nNo industrial or anything like that, eat you eat it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I definitely eat it?\n\n Like at Ruble Lake in the Colorado Mountains just north of Alamosa, Colorado, I go fishing there and I'll eat that trout and the catfish.\n\n I love catfish.\n\n They're fatty.\n\n\r\nAs long as they're not polluted.\n\n However, I'm very nervous about everything now, so I put clay in almost all the milk that I drink just to make sure that I've got enough to bind and I'm eating cheese frequently to bind with any radioactive material.\n\n I had so much radiation therapy I can't risk it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Mushrooms Mycelium \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOn the mushroom, can we eat raw any mushroom in the market\n\n Mushroom you don't need to cook?\n\n**[Aajonus],[I wouldn't eat poisonous ones lol]**\n\r\nYou can eat any one raw \n, but what I'd suggest is, let's say somebody who has multiple sclerosis, a mycelium would go wild in a body like that because that's what's going to eat up all these dead dried nerve cells throughout the body.\n\n\r\nSo, they will go into a massive detoxification where there'll be an invalet, even though they mostly become an invalet anyway, as they advance in MS.\n\n \r\nSo, you just have to try a little bit every day, a little bit of the same one, and see how you tolerate it because it will be a heavy detoxifier.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, is that right.\n\n\r\nHow about the miso?\n\n The Japanese have that miso?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe miso is full of salt toxic stuff.\n\n Salt.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Mycelium \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow a mushroom works\n\n The mushroom is just a fruit of the mycelium.\n\n Mycelium is a solvent, a living solvent, a fungus that goes into the ground and it eats dead roots.\n\n That's all it does, it eats dead roots.\n\n If it finds an insect with hardened arteries or a dead insect, it can also eat that, but its main purpose is to dissolve dried dead roots of anything, whether tree, grass, bush, doesn't matter what it is, it eats roots.\n\n Once it's finished in a location, it will sprout mushrooms for the spores to spread, and it looks for more dried roots to do it.\n\n \r\nAnd of course with grass, you cut it all the time.\n\n Like this grass is dead.\n\n There'd be a mycelium to break those roots down to free up the soil so you could grow grass again.\n\n So the mushroom, when the radioactive material gets into the dirt and gets locked in with the minerals, and the mycelium breaks down it's adjacent roots, and that radioactive material gets involved in the mushroom and the mycelium, and then it's part of the mushroom as it's spores.\n\n\r\nIf you consume it raw, the likelihood of you having a problem is very minimal.\n\n \r\nIf you eat it cooked, you're always gonna cause contamination.\n\n You've got arsenic, you've got lead, you've got mercury, you've got all of these trace toxic substances in every food you eat.\n\n Once you cook them, that makes them available to do damage.\n\n Otherwise, they're beneficial.\n\n\r\nSmall amounts, they are beneficial.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) ORGANIC PASTURES \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow's this affect organic pastures since, I mean, they don't cross the state line, but do they sell just in California or do they cross state lines\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey can pass across the state line if they freeze it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, right now, is this law going to affect them in California.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's only going across state line?\n\n\r\nBut I don't like Organic Pastures.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it because they are nutritionally deficient.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey have to keep their coliform count down to 10?\n\n The only way to do that is to use heavy chlorine in the tanks and not rinse them completely.\n\n  \r\nThat's why you've got that funny taste in it.\n\n\r\nAnd plus, he's a greedy man, Mark McAfee, he cuts the cream off and sells extra cream and leaves the milk skimmed, so it's not really, and he's got whole milk on there.\n\n It's not whole.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI think he's the only one who has a big one.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n We've got another dairy here, Claravale, but they're not grass fed.\n\n Those cows never see grass and they're hay fed, and plus their commercial organic feed fed.\n\n \r\nThey got on me about a year ago.\n\n They said, \"You've gotta stop badmouthing our milk\".\n\n I said, \"I don't badmouth your milk.\n\n I just say, you use a commercial non-organic brand of feed for this cow when you milk them\".\n\n\r\n\"Oh no, we don't\".\n\n I said, \"Well, send me the label.\n\n The last time I got your labels, it was just a regular old dairy feed commercial brand.\n\n Send me your labels\".\n\n They never sent me their labels, so I knew that they lying.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's gonna happen if you drink that milk.\n\n If you drink it are you gonna get sick?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n You just won't be as healthy.\n\n That's why I have our milk from our cows in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and other places.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy health has definitely since I started drinking the Pennsylvania milk, instead of the Organic Pastures.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd you understand why you can't have the contract with a farmer.\n\n You've gotta legally support him.\n\n That's why I can't let you make that contract through Right To Choose Healthy Foods with that farmer, with Eli King.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Oysetrs, Scallops, Clams, Liquid In Oysters \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMiso is full of salt and toxic stuff\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about oysters and scallops and stuff like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe oyster has the ability to store all the poisons, even radioactive materials in the shell?\n\n So, I don't mind oysters.\n\n Clams, it depends upon the clam and what waters they're in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMuscles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMuscles usually are pretty good too?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd what about scallops.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nScallops?\n\n I haven't tested scallops, so I don't really know?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about the liquid in oysters.\n\n Is that salt?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because that's sea water that's already been filtered and a lot of the sodium's been eliminated, but still high in sodium, so you have to be careful?\n\n Some people will react to it and some people won't.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI got headaches from them.\n\n Really bad headaches from the water of the oyster.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Some people don't have a problem.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Radiation In Chernobyl \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have been reading a great deal online about the radioactive fallout and how it's affecting everything, including I put fruit trees in this little tiny yard that we have\n\n Turns out in Germany today from Cher Noble in forests where mushrooms grow and the wild boars eat the mushrooms in these forests that if a hunter shoots a wild, they are required by law to have it inspected for its radiation content because there's so much radiation in the wild mushrooms from these very porous sorts of floors in the forest because of how the mushrooms take it up like a sponge.\n\n\r\nThe bore eats and it concentrates in the bore's body and 1000 - 2000 bores per year are not allowed to be consumed because the radiation levels are so high.\n\n This is from Chernobyl today.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, I'm reading this and of course, what did I use in my yard that's nothing but hard pan concrete.\n\n I got forest products to amend the soil, right.\n\n To put in the macadamian tree?\n\n These things, you know.\n\n So, now I'm sitting here thinking, holy crap.\n\n You know, pardon my language.\n\n But, so I covered some of them up around the base to keep the rain water off, and I'm putting filtered water on them to try to keep the rainwater from, anyway, so this is, I'm just wondering and I've read that there are a lot of very creative farmers in that region who came up with ways to amend soil with clays and so forth and different minerals to try to neutralize the toxicity from the radiation.\n\n\r\nAnd was wondering if because you have so much contact with these farmers and I don't have the luxury to live on a piece of land where I can be a farmer, which I would love to do that.\n\n If there are certain things that they're doing or that you've heard of to help deal with this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, always look at this picture first.\n\n\r\nWhen you cook something, you fractionate everything and you release a radioactive material that will be damaging and harmful.\n\n When it is bound in other nutrients.\n\n It is neutralized to a great extent.\n\n So they cook the pig, they got big problems if it's high in radiation, if you don't cook the pig and eat it raw.\n\n Most of it's going to be not storing your body and it's going to pass out of the body, either in the feces or in your urine, less in the urine, but in the feces, urine or your perspiration.\n\n\r\nSo, it's not going to get into the glands in areas like that.\n\n Now, the mushroom, how the mushroom works, the mushroom is just a fruit of the mycelium.\n\n Mycelium is a solvent, a living solvent, a fungus that goes into the ground and it eats dead roots.\n\n That's all it does, it eats dead roots.\n\n If it finds an insect with hardened arteries or a dead insect, it can also eat that, but its main purpose is to dissolve dried dead roots of anything, whether tree, grass, bush, doesn't matter what it is, it eats roots.\n\n Once it's finished in a location, it will sprout mushrooms for the spores to spread, and it looks for more dried roots to do it.\n\n \r\nAnd of course with grass, you cut it all the time.\n\n Like this grass is dead.\n\n There'd be a mycelium to break those roots down to free up the soil so you could grow grass again.\n\n So the mushroom, when the radioactive material gets into the dirt and gets locked in with the minerals, and the mycelium breaks down it's adjacent roots, and that radioactive material gets involved in the mushroom and the mycelium, and then it's part of the mushroom as it's spores.\n\n\r\nIf you consume it raw, the likelihood of you having a problem is very minimal.\n\n \r\nIf you eat it cooked, you're always gonna cause contamination.\n\n You've got arsenic, you've got lead, you've got mercury, you've got all of these trace toxic substances in every food you eat.\n\n Once you cook them, that makes them available to do damage.\n\n Otherwise, they're beneficial.\n\n\r\nSmall amounts, they are beneficial.\n\n\r\nSmall amounts, they are beneficial.\n\n  when.\n\n When they're in conjunction and coupled with other nutrients?\n\n So remember, you want to have the greatest resistance to any kind of nuclear fallout you have to do what the Japanese do.\n\n You eat lots of raw sushi or raw meats.\n\n It doesn't have to be fish, just raw meats and lots of raw foods.\n\n They eat a lot of raw foods.\n\n They'll even have orange with their their sashimi meals, slice of orange at the end in Japan.\n\n They have mostly raw food.\n\n They're the only country in the world that mostly eats raw foods, besides the Massai tribes, the Samburu, Fulani, and the Eskimo.\n\n \r\nOf course, they're eating sprouts and they're eating seaweeds and stuff like that.\n\n They're very difficult to eat, but still they're not putting so much contamination in their body from cooked foods that allow those toxic substances to infiltrate and do damage in their body.\n\n\r\nEven though not on the best diet like the Messai, the Samburu, Fulani and Eskimo used to be before they were ruined by Great Britain.\n\n And we've ruined Eskimos and Great Britain has ruined all of Africa and those s tribes.\n\n\r\nSo, the point is you can protect yourself more with the raw food.\n\n Cooking will damage you in more ways than one now that we have all this radioactive contamination.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith the Japanese, what are they doing besides the raw fish.\n\n Are they eating your seaweed product or is that contaminated there too?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, of course it's going be contaminated now, but Japanese are between a rock and a hard place?\n\n The US government's gonna destroy them.\n\n They were coming out with a car that ran on water this year.\n\n It's been ruined.\n\n It's over.\n\n It's not happening.\n\n Tthey were purposely ruined because.\n\n That country will never survive now cause you can't stop the China syndrome.\n\n It's too late.\n\n\r\nI won't eat anything that isn't out of the deep ocean.\n\n\r\nI'll eat shark.\n\n I'll eat swordfish and I'll eat tuna, any deep sea fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou won't eat salmon?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n I stopped eating salmon two years ago cuz every time I ate it I got sick and they're lying like a rug.\n\n The salmon industry with Monsanto and they're GMO, genetically modified fish.\n\n\r\nThey released it over 15 years ago to the wild.\n\n Every time I eat salmon, even if it's from good waters, I get sick, so I stopped eating it about three years ago.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Raw Milk Lawsuit \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOkay\n\n First I'm gonna talk about the raw milk issue that's going on.\n\n The FDA finally stepped over the boundary and filed suit against one of my farmers, in Right To Choose Healthy Foods that we've contracted for their animals.\n\n And the FDA filed suit for a permanent injunction in civil court to stop them from producing raw milk for commerce.\n\n \r\nNow they don't sell to the public, so the Amish farmer, they don't sue.\n\n \r\nSo, he just filed an answer saying, \"I'm not in commerce.\n\n You have no jurisdiction.\n\n Go away\".\n\n \r\nI filed a cross-complaint and intervention saying that those cows are mine, belong to Right To Choose Healthy FoodS And you created a fraudulent lawsuit, a trivial one, and, you manufactured a warrant against HIM and he is not in commerce And I warned you on May 15th, 2010, I issued you a notice about it.\n\n You've disregarded it.\n\n it's also a conspiracy because you've gone up to quite a few of the farmers on this program and which you have no jurisdiction over.\n\n\r\nSo, I filed against them for fraud, conspiracy, Racketeering, deprivation of civil rights and kidnapping, False arrest.\n\n \r\nYou have to understand, if I subdue you for 5 or 10 minutes, it's kidnapping.\n\n When they do it, it's false arrest, IT'S BULLcrap.\n\n It's kidnapping.\n\n So, I've gone after them for kidnapping, not for false arrests.\n\n\r\nWell, I put kidnapping in parentheses (false arrest) in the answers.\n\n \r\nSo, I was hoping they would make this movement for a long time, and they have now I've got to file the suit.\n\n And there are two high powered attorneys, one that tries cases on the right to association, which we have the right to do.\n\n\r\nClubs have the right to associate without government interference and then an attorney who  won against the FDA seven times.\n\n So, these attorneys have agreed to pursue it.\n\n I want to do it myself, and I'm thinking about all three of us doing it because I named Doe's, 1 through 15, which are club members.\n\n If you go over any more of that becomes a class action suit and I couldn't handle class action suit, it's too complex and too complicated.\n\n So, I've left it with just John Does, 1 through 15 for just members and then against all the agents for the government, 1 to 100 Doe's.\n\n\r\n[Doe's means John Doe, a.\n\nk.\n\na, generic placeholder name]\r\nSo, that is the situation we're gonna see.\n\n I filed the cross complaint last Tuesday.\n\n So, we will see, when I was in Washington DC in Pennsylvania, visiting the farmer who was on his farm against whom the suit was filed.\n\n \r\nSo, I will let you know by email how that goes when I get their answer.\n\n The judge could be a jerk and then throw it out and then I'll have to appeal and go through all kinds of things, but he doesn't throw it out, then we will proceed to trial.\n\n I asked for a jury trial.\n\n They also requested magistrates, and I said, a magistrate is not a judge and will not proceed over this trial at all.\n\n\r\nAnd I had a jury demand trial.\n\n I'm not gonna go with any judge.\n\n A judge works for the government, doesn't work for us.\n\n So, that is the situation.\n\n Any questions about that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWow, that's a big step?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep.\n\n All judges work for the government.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how do you get around.\n\n Oh, that's with the jury?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJury, yes?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJust to clarify, there's some farmers that contract milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat it is I created Right To choose Healthy Food, which contracts with different farmers?\n\n We lease their cows, they're animals, chickens, whatever.\n\n\r\nWhether we want eggs, we want meat, we want dairy, whatever.\n\n S, they are not under health department restrictions for all their toxins, their poisons.\n\n They want us to put chlorine on our food and all these poisons on our food.\n\n I don't want those things on my food.\n\n So, to get out of their jurisdiction, we have to create an environment that removes them from jurisdiction.\n\n\r\nThey have jurisdiction over sales to the public.\n\n So, when Right To choose Healthy Food contracts with a farmer, he contracts for even the land if we want them to grow things and don't want that to be treated the way the health departments want any county, state, or federal health department regulations, we want to avoid those cuz they're all toxic.\n\n\r\nSo, the Right To choose Healthy Food members own those animals.\n\n They're not buying the milk, we own the milk, we don't buy the meat.\n\n We own the meat.\n\n We pay the farmer for caring for the animals, boarding them, milking them, bottling our food or packaging our food and then delivering it to us in the way that we want.\n\n\r\nThen the member clubs and I have those spread out all over and there are many different club names that are part of Right To choose Healthy Food Club.\n\n Those members sign an agreement  so that they know they own the food.\n\n They're not selling it.\n\n They cannot be acting under color of law, which means they cannot be an undercover agent and that's what they did with Dan Auger, that farmer who they filed suit again against, they had several undercover agents sign the document and then claim that they were sold the milk.\n\n So it's fraud.\n\n So, we have their signed, even though they use false names, we have there signed document.\n\n \r\nIt's a conspiracy.\n\n It's a rat race.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow can you possibly- I mean, if they're going to pretend to be in it, that makes me worried about people like telephone calling.\n\n Do I need to be worried.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWorried about what?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAbout telling people about how to get raw milk?\n\n Do I have to be careful about that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI mean, no, you tell them you have to join the club.\n\n\r\nYou have to be a part owner and that's okay.\n\n You can, you can be a part owner in anything.\n\n So no, you don't have to be afraid to tell people.\n\n It's just that when you sign the membership agreement, it says you cannot testify against anything about the club nor anyone in the club, but you have to testify against any government agent who interferes with.\n\n\r\nSo, these agents, these undercover agents won't even be allowed to get on trial in the courtroom.\n\n They won't even be allowed to get on the stand because I've got an agreement.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's the outcome.\n\n What do you foresee?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, it's all depends on how hard the federal government wants to prove Nazissm?\n\n It's nazim.\n\n Full and hard and strong.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, how much do they wanna prove.\n\n You mean that they all want to go forward and really?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n They want to completely control everything so that we have to buy Monsanto's products and everything.\n\n\r\nTthey tried to outlaw three times last year manure as fertilizer.\n\n Cause it has E.\n\ncoli and dangerous, so they're saying Monsanto is safe, chemical poisons safe over bacteria when our bodies are 150 bacterial genes to every 1 human gene.\n\n We're not even 1% human.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, They said, you can't take a poop.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, take a poop, you're breaking the law.\n\n You're contaminating everything.\n\n And that's one of things they said that Dan Auger was spreading disease to the community by producing raw milk.\n\n Rw milk has never been contagious.\n\n No disease that you supposedly get from raw milk or any milk is contagious.\n\n\r\nIt's more fraud and false acting conspiracy.\n\n That's why I went after them hard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI wonder when they're gonna make breastfeeding illegal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey've tried.\n\n Oh yeah, they tried.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe state of California.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe state of California?\n\n No, the state of California doesn't touch it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould it make any sense to, to petition Jerry Brown, something like that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNot Jerry Brown *laughs*?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, who's the senator involved in this.\n\n Is there senator involved in this?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, Ron Paul?\n\n He's not a senator.\n\n He is a congressman.\n\n He's from Texas.\n\n He wrote the raw milk bill.\n\n I worked with him on it, he just issued a new raw milk bill that will wipe out the FDA, of course, completely jurisdiction over raw milk crossing state lines.\n\n But it's very doubtful that that will pass because when I spent three months lobbying, while months setting it up, and there were five of us that went to Washington, DC in 2007, and we spent two months going to every Congressman, senators and the House of Representatives, all 535, and I gave them my milk report, mine and Dr.\n\n Douglas's milk report in favor of raw milk.\n\n Issued that everyone, and we had conversations with probably 115 for anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours, and we were out all day long, 10 hours a day doing this for that period.\n\n \r\nAnd let me tell you, most of 'em thought raw milk was dangerous.\n\n They believe the media scam on it, the propaganda and it's, it's constant.\n\n So, it's likely that it won't pass.\n\n I mean, everybody's going to have to send in their thing saying you this is false information, I've been drinking raw milk even when it's soured and even when it's bad and not clean and never had a disease, so this is false information.\n\n Everybody's gonna have to do that.\n\n We're gonna have to get several million people to do it.\n\n That might make a difference.\n\n \r\nBut if the president goes through and vetos it, like Schwartzenegger did.\n\n We got that bill through the assembly and the Senate here in California a year and a half ago and it passed almost unanimously out of both the Senate and the Assembly.\n\n Only two people voted against it, so that meant a couple of hundred people voted for it and Schwarzenegger vetoed it, just like that.\n\n \r\nSo, it's a dance that they do because when the president or a governor vetos something they can override because there are more votes, more representation from the senators and the assembly persons than there is one person in the highest office.\n\n \r\nSo, all they had to do was override it and like Michael said, it was out of courtesy.\n\n Courtesy to whom.\n\n Who the hell are they working for?\n\n They working for the Republican party or Schwartzenegger, or are they working for the people?\n\n Courtesy to us?\n\n That's what it should be?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Sauna \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's a dry heat\n\n It's gonna dry out your sinuses, the heat needs to be directly in contact with the skin.\n\n You've got an air pocket, your body is an air conditioner.\n\n You would have to constantly move in either a steam or a sauna to keep your heat contacting directly with the skin cuz your body creates an air pocket to cool itself.\n\n\r\nIt does that in water too, but it's doesn't work as well.\n\n You'll notice that you can be there and the water feels comfortable and you start moving and all of a sudden it gets hot hot when the water hits the skin again.\n\n \r\nWell, when you've got an air pocket, it's very easy to do that and the air will flow with the body, but when you're moving in water, it's too heavy.\n\n It breaks up the cooling system, the buffering water between you and the heat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen I get outta a bath, sometimes I get under the covers and I sweat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Keep doing it.\n\n\r\nWell, I would say you still need some fat in there.\n\n So coconut cream, there's gotta be something leftover you can put in there.\n\n If I were going to, I would use a half a cup if I didn't have the milk instead of 2, 3 tablespoons, I'd be using a half a cup.\n\n\r\nLet me tell you, you or your hair will be such a mess when you get out, but yeah, you can use that.\n\n \r\nJust remember that coconut cream is 92% - 93% of the coconut cream, which are oils are water soluble fats, so it disperses in the water.\n\n You put oil, olive oil, any kinda oil, it's gonna float on the top and it's not going to get in there and arrest the toxin.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI couldn't find anything else.\n\n \r\nAnd you do not want to rinse this off your body.\n\n What you put into the water that you soak in, you want to leave and just dry yourself off?\n\n\r\nYou don't wanna shower it off afterwards.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n What I do is I take a washcloth, either silk or cotton, soft and I rub it off cuz I want all the dead skin off as well, so that I can make sure I perspire properly.\n\n \r\nSo, while I'm in there, after 20 minutes, I'll be cleaning all the dead cells off cuz they will have softened in that time.\n\n\r\nAnd before I get out, anything that's come out of the skin, which may be mercury that's locked onto the skin with some coconut cream or some milk or some clay, I will rinse that, wipe it off, and then get out of the tub.\n\n\r\nSometimes the coconut cream will make a line, but I just rub it with my hand in warm water and it comes right off.\n\n You can use a wash clothe, it would probably be a little quicker, easier, but then you've got the coconut cream in the cloth.\n\n You can, yes.\n\n Now that the radiation is here.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Smart Meters \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou know you can refuse though\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, it's not on my house.\n\n Neighbor's closest bedroom.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's not legal.\n\n You have to have at least six feet between houses.\n\n So, it has to be at least six feet away from you.\n\n The smart meter's on the house, let's say in your bed, is your bed right up against the wall where the smart meter is.\n\n You've probably got 10 feet, so you're getting a fallout, but you're not getting the direct effects of it, but you're pretty sensitive and you can use the clay and milk?\n\n\r\nYou could use it 2 - 3 times a day.\n\n One tablespoon of moist terrmain clay.\n\n That means pre soaked.\n\n Yes, terramjn clay in water and then you put one tablespoon into 3 - 4 ounces of milk.\n\n You could do that two to three times daily.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnything else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that should help a lot?\n\n The clay should help buffer a lot of that.\n\n And the hot water, of course, it helps perspire the toxins out of the body that are left over.\n\n If you're not perspiring those toxins out, there're just gonna collect in your body and be worse, make you worse and worse collectively.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat is a smart meter.\n\n What is that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a new measurement of electricity that's used in a house?\n\n And they create a huge magnetic and radiation field.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nOh God.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat goes like six feet, 6 to 10 feet.\n\n Wow.\n\n So, if you got one on your house and you've got a bedroom behind it or child's room, you're in trouble.\n\n\r\nThat baby's in trouble.\n\n You're in trouble.\n\n I don't let them.\n\n No, I said I wouldn't let them.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nBut it's mandatory in San Diego.\n\n They said you can't refuse it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can sue them all.\n\n All you gotta do is get enough people together to sue them.\n\n\r\nWhat you need to do is get an attorney who will write it for you and you go file it yourself.\n\n You pay 'em to write.\n\n\r\nThey only charge $6,000 - $8,000 to write the complaint.\n\n\r\nNo, I'm saying you get a group of people together and you do it as a group.\n\n So you get, let's say 15 people.\n\n It won't be a class action with 15 to 18 people.\n\n So each one of 'em puts in $500.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Sodium Is An Explosive, Frog Legs Salt, Can You Absorb Salt, Different Salt Types \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSalt is an explosive\n\n Sodium isolated is an explosive.\n\n It's more volatile than nitroglycerin.\n\n One football size of pure sodium will take out New York City and all the buildings, one football size.\n\n\r\nAnd my father worked with General Electric trying to make it into a weapon, a bomb, and it was so volatile that 1.\n\n5° temperature change could set it off.\n\n\r\nThey spent 60 years trying to make it into a weapon and still have not been able to in $2 billion.\n\n So it is volatile, if you wanna see how volatile it is.\n\n There were three guys that went on the internet were going to ridicule me about salt, and they got three frog legs that had been killed within 24 hours and they salted them and they're giggling and laughing, expecting nothing to happen.\n\n\r\nWithin about 15 seconds of salting these things, these legs started jumping, just jumping Now these are dead.\n\n They've been off of these frogs for a while, hours, and they are jumping.\n\n You cannot stop it.\n\n It is volatile as an explosive, and it only took about 15 seconds or less for the salt to touch not the skin, but the peeled leg of the frog that was peeled, so it was open flesh to isolate the sodium from the potassium, from the potassium or iodide, whatever table salt they were using and causing the explosion.\n\n \r\nAnd I they, \"Now what do you think will happen if you use pepper on it.\n\n Cause it's very caustic, it's hot\"?\n\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Won't do a thing\".\n\n So, they take just one leg and they pepper it.\n\n And I mean, they're putting probably 10 times more pepper than they put salt.\n\n And, the leg jumps once.\n\n But with the salt, I mean, it was just a few sprinkles.\n\n Those legs were jumping.\n\n Now they only leave it on for 30 seconds, but it went on for almost two and a half minutes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat on YouTube.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it's on YouTube?\n\n You put \"frog legs, YouTube, salt\", watch video and you'll come up with it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut the bodies, they want salt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't want salt.\n\n You want sodium in form of food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, but you still put salt in bath water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that doesn't get absorbed into the body.\n\n If you put two cups of salt in that water, you're going to absorb it in probably 1 cup of salt into 34, 35 gallons.\n\n \r\nYou will absorb salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about the ocean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIn the ocean, you will absorb salt, sodium?\n\n That's why you can't drink ocean water.\n\n right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs epsom salt better?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, epsom salt is a little bit better?\n\n It's not so concentrated in just mainly sodium.\n\n But you know, if you're using sea salts, you're getting a variety of of nutrients.\n\n\r\nBut in epsom salts, you're getting a higher ratio of calcium, magnesium, rather then just sodium being the highest.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCould you do one, one time and then one the other time.\n\n You know, vary it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSure.\n\n You can do anything you want.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean, would that be good or not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI think it would be good?\n\n Epsom salt is probably less expensive than sea salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's way less expensive.\n\n \r\nYeah, like 1/10th expensive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's got magnesium content, but it's just not magnesium.\n\n\r\nIt's supposed to have all those minerals in it.\n\n They just accentuate because it's the higher ratio of sulfur and magnesium.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Tooth Infectio \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI have a chronic infection under, I dunno if you remember, I had a tooth that succumbed to starting a root canal, right\n\n So they reamed out the thing?\n\n But I've managed to keep from getting it filled.\n\n It's been like three years now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe tooth is not turning black and rotting.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, how wonderful.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if I don't have enough juice every day, it starts to get irritated, the base, and I can't chew on it.\n\n If I put pressure on it, or if I'm grinding my teeth at night or something, it gets irritated.\n\n Now I haven't been doing the baths, so it may be that I'm just not releasing it enough.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can see you're not doing your baths cause you've got a collection of waste in your connective tissue that is.\n\n yeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI need to do it, obviously.\n\n Would that probably be enough to relieve this, or do I need to just go ahead and get the tooth out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOr fill it?\n\n I filled all my root canals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat did you fill it with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI filled with the calcium like dolomite?\n\n \r\nNow I would use terramin now, but when I had it done I had used a dolomite product.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo you just packed it in there with the dolomite clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep and then have them put a plastic over that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThis has maintained pretty darn amazingly well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you're on a good diet.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Trifield Meter \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, you can either wear it, or you can plug it into your house and it grounds the wires for your house\n\n I have something that plugs into my wireless router, it grounds all my wireless stuff.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid you take a tri field meter and test.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI did?\n\n I did take a meter and I'm trying to think.\n\n\r\nWell, I took a meter to my surrounding area before I bought the system for the house and I'd love for you just to look at it sometime.\n\nShe seems like a very knowledgeable woman.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've seen very knowledgeable people selling all kinds of gadgets, and I put it there between that and the Tri field meter and the source.\n\n And the only time I ever got a reaction was a bio chip that you put on a cell phone and it reduced it by one milligal, I mean half a milligal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I have to tell you, I feel better from using it.\n\n My husband now can use his computer without getting headaches.\n\n My daughter can use her computer and things at her house without getting the same experience or the same thing.\n\n\r\nSo, I don't know that it's the cure, but maybe it evades it a little bit.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt's still traveling through the air.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n See the thing I'm afraid of, maybe they've buffered the symptoms of it, but the collective harm done can be even worse.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhere would you measure on the tri field meter.\n\n Where would you put the little reading?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI check on each one?\n\n I check on all three.\n\n Electromagnetic, electrostatic and the radiation.\n\n I check all three waves.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey can paint a coating on the walls of a room.\n\n That's one way I, dunno what it is.\n\n And it has a silver cloth that can block you.\n\n You put it over the meter and they can't read it anymore.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I have a silver cloth.\n\n I use that.\n\n**[Attendee #4]**\n\r\nYou can like make your house into an oven.\n\n So, even these guys that say they know what hell doing, they don't.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey don't know all of it.\n\n They've worked at one little angle.\n\n It's like the medical profession.\n\n You work out one thing and you've got a side effect of that, so you have to work out that angle and you're taking 40 medications.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, I suppose if it was inside the house, then it's not gonna get out.\n\n It's gonna be bouncing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, bouncing off, back and forth inside.\n\n \r\nNow what I did for my Prius and any car, they all have a very high electromagnetic field.\n\n I took inch round magnets and made 'em in three centrifugal circles and I spaced them an inch apart all the way around positive, you know, north, south, north, south, north, south, all the way around.\n\n\r\nSo, what it does is it repels, so it doesn't allow any frequency to stay steady and I sit and I have that between two down pillows and I sit on that in my car when I used to drive down here, when I first got the, that's a hybrid car with electric and gas.\n\n My legs used to ache, I mean ache, especially back here with this foot on the pedal and the highest amount of electromagnetic field is at that gas pedal, like can get up to 75 - 80 milligals, back away it's 8 - 13 depending upon if it's running on electric or gas.\n\n \r\nSo, I made this pillow.\n\n Now I never have a problem.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey do show material, at least I've seen on the internet that does have shielding properties,  galvanized steel plate.\n\n I stuck a electric shaver into a galvanized steel plate and then took the meter next to it and that.\n\n\r\nIt seemed to work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid it work.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDid it lower the field.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIt eliminated it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo kidding, completely.\n\n Galvanized steel?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Galvanized steel plate.\n\n That's what this guy said, that if the meter is facing out, usually there's a plate behind it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n So, it won't go into the house.\n\n It'll keep broadcasting it out.\n\n So, use that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThe meters are usually- the back of it is a steel plate, so it doesn't go into the house.\n\n But if you're standing in front of it, it's setting out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's facing me.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, I know.\n\n You have a problem cause your neighbor.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nExactly.\n\n They say it's radiating.\n\n\r\nI mean, I've talked to experts in the field.\n\n It radiates 360° and he said it goes up 15 feet.\n\n So, they're all broadcasting.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat you could do is ask your neighbor if there's a wall, put steel plates that would block in front of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to understand it broadcasts in a circle, in a wave like this.\n\n So if you have a plate that is close to it the waves are going to go above your house and into the ground.\n\n It's not gonna hit your house.\n\n Depending about how large the plate is and how close it is to the meter.\n\n\r\nThen you'd have to have a big plate in your house to cover the wall or on the outside of your house.\n\n That would be very expensive, but it might be worth it if you're suffering.\n\n\r\nWell, everybody's getting bombarded with radiation.\n\n\r\nEverybody's getting more symptoms, but those on the diet are okay.\n\n But other people who are coming on with the diet have lots of symptoms of all kinds of things.\n\n \r\nYou are one who doesn't handle it.\n\n Are you doing the hot baths.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot as much as I should?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Vinegar Or Pineapple&papaya For Skin \n \n**[2011],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's purified and then it goes to that and it's ionized\n\n Is that okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n You're electrically altering the natural charges of the minerals, and you don't know what soup it's going to make inside your body.\n\n\r\nIt's like, okay, the brain uses electrical charges in light.\n\n Is it okay to get shock therapy.\n\n It discombobulates the whole nervous system?\n\n Most people that I know who had shock therapy had to relearn language, relearn math, relearn everything.\n\n\r\nSo, not a good thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI would like to know, I have recently got this little mole or whatever on my face and I've got like moles and warts or whatever.\n\n How can I get rid of those.\n\n Can I use iodine or apple cider vinegar?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nApple cider vinegar can help peel it off a little at a time?\n\n\r\nPineapple, applying it once every five days, you don't want to do more than that.\n\n So, you can use vinegar every day, you can use pineapple once every five days, but don't use the vinegar and the pineapple on the same day.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nJust apply.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, just to the area?\n\n Not all around.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNo drinking, just apply.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can drink it too?\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut don't use the apple cider vinegar and the pineapple together, not on the same day.\n\n\r\nUse one or the other.\n\n\r\nAnd also papaya, just put papaya.\n\n You can also rub papaya on.\n\n \r\nAnd what I tell people to do, I tell people to rotate pineapple, vinegar, papaya every five days and you can put the vinegar on every day if you want.\n\n \r\nI like to rotate the papaya and the pineapple on a five day schedule.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Weight Loss, Lose Weight On Flu \n \n**[2011],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLast time I did a weight loss was about four, maybe even five years ago, and I know you've said, \"do it every two and a half\"\n\n And I keep saying to myself, you gotta go do it cuz it's been a while, but every time it's just like if I'm not doing one detox, I'm doing another.\n\n I just had a flu,  and then I'll have some pains, or then I'll go through some vomiting or I'll have diarrhea and I go, \"you know, I don't want to do the weight loss while I'm doing this detox\".\n\n\r\nSo, four years is gonna go on five and it's gonna go on six.\n\n And so I don't know if I should just do it or if I should just coast and I mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you have to understand that if you don't do it, then you're gonna keep having your symptoms.\n\n If you go through like hot baths while you're doing mainly proteins and getting the fat off of your body with the contaminates in it, then you're not going to have to do it with colds and flus or vomit and diarrhea and it's a good idea.\n\n You need to take it off.\n\n I think it should be every two and a half years.\n\n \r\nUsually, in most people it, it'll happen naturally.\n\n You'll have a cold or, a flu that'll take a lot of weight off at the same time, doesn't work for you that way.\n\n Your body doesn't work that way?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWell, I just had a flu and I maybe lost 10 pounds?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell keep doing it from then on.\n\n Just keep doing the process of the weight loss stuff.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, then do the weight, because I was thinking, geez, I just had a flu, shouldn't go into a weight loss with, do you know what I mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because that's why the flu happened to help lose that excess weight and toxins?\n\n\r\nSo, you can mitigate the amount of symptoms that you will experience, the amount of colds and flus if you go on the weight loss.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nSo, essentially I should just do it regardless.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, especially right after a flu.\n\n That's the best time to do it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n See, I thought the other way around.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you were skinny, no, absolutely.\n\n If you were only slightly overweight, not a problem.\n\n But I can see you're carrying about good 15-20 pounds of.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nOh, more than that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI mean, no, I mean, to where it's.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Woman Ate 128 Oysters \n \n**[2011],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOh, and she's six foot tall, huge boobs like Dolly Parton, big girl\n\n And I got a call one evening or late afternoon, probably 5:30 my time, 8:30 their time in Toronto, or 7:30 their time and she said, \"This is Juliana.\n\n I'm at a restaurant and I've eaten 28 oysters already and I'm just hungry for them.\n\n I want to eat more.\n\n Is that okay\".\n\n \r\nI said, \"You can eat as many as you want, long as you don't get a headache in the morning, you know, you don't wanna get horny in the restaurant and arrest your boyfriend\".\n\n \r\nSo, hung up.\n\n I get a call an hour later and it's her boyfriend.\n\n \"She's eaten 115 oysters already.\n\n Is there going to be a problem here\".\n\n\r\nI said, \"No?\n\n She gets full.\n\n She'll stop eating it\".\n\n She ate 128, 128 oysters.\n\n She was horny for six weeks and her boyfriend loved it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

like cows.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n There's a dairy that's a government dairy that was a test dairy that was started, New Zealand funded it.\n\n Now they fund it, I get all the milk that they have.\n\n They only have two milking cows, but they're they're holsteins, so there's very little fat, very little cream in them.\n\n\r\nThey're a1 cows not a2 so the milk, even though it's nourishing, it's not as nourishing as I would like.\n\n And there are on different islands, like on Samal islands, there's 7,107 islands in the Philippines.\n\n I will do a lot of the island hopping to see all of it, but I found a big dairy on Samal Island, which is part Mindanao and they've got a pretty big dairy there and they have jerseys.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan you buy a couple cows.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I'm gonna buy a couple cows?\n\n I just have to put the fence up.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWill you be able to get enough cream in a tropical environment from the cows.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n When you have a cow in the tropics, the vitamin D in it keeps it a homogonized.\n\n So it doesn't separate the same, but I don't need it to separate in the tropics cuz I don't need- if you eat butter there, which I take with me, it causes a lot more perspiration and heat, body heat.\n\n I like the heat so it doesn't bother me, but people look at me dripping wet and they say, \"Oh my God, are you okay.\n\n\"\r\nI say, \"I love it\"?\n\n If you have the cream and milk, you don't perspire as much.\n\n Butter will make you perspire more.\n\n So, I wouldn't make butter there.\n\n I would just have rich, creamy milk.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, people coming in wouldn't be getting butter at the clinic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n Well, I would probably import some or somehow make some indefinitely.\n\n\r\nI would have to have butter for some sick people.\n\n I would find a way.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Aajonus Is Homeless, Travelling, Moving To Philipines \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWe'll start it off by saying, I'm homeless folks\n\n , I got kicked outta my Malibu place that's a  rehab for wealthy people and they decided they wanted to make some changes on the property, so they had to have a building inspection over and approve the changes that they wanted to make.\n\n\r\nSo, the building inspection decided to inspect everything on the property.\n\n Came to my house and he said, there's no permit for this house.\n\n You gotta tear it down.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\nOh my goodness.\n\n Oh my God.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, I just got notice on Tuesday, so everything is going into boxes.\n\n So, I'm homeless and they gave me till the 18th, but I'm leaving tomorrow for Thailand, so I have to pack up everything in five days.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\nGeez.\n\n Oh really.\n\n Do you have help?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I don't want any help?\n\n Cause I want to know where exactly everything is.\n\n Thank you though.\n\n People did offer the help, but I can't afford it.\n\n I need to know where everything is.\n\n So, I've been getting one hour of sleep a day.\n\n\r\nI returned September 23rd to no home, so they had some bungalows up near Canan Doom Road and one of 'em is one bedroom, so they're gonna give me that till mid-November, because as soon as I get back I'm only back a week and then I go on my next tour here, I go to Aspen, then Sedona, Chicago, and then St.\n\nLouis.\n\n So I'll be gone that whole month of October.\n\n So I have just two weeks in November to look for a place.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo you don't need a home.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* I need one about three months a year here in LA?\n\n That one was a perfect one.\n\n My hot tub, everything and they've gotta bury the hot tub, it was illegal.\n\n\r\nI didn't know you needed a permit, but you know if I had gone for that permit for that hot tub then I would've lost the house 10 years ago because that's when I built the hot tub.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou've been there 10 years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n11 years?\n\n I thought I was gonna be able to be there for my life.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDid you own the house Aajonus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n I would've had a heart attack if I had to tear down if it were mine.\n\n It belongs to Fred Siegel.\n\n\r\nThe Fred Siegel clothing store thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you were leasing it from him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, renting?\n\n Well, I was leasing on a yearly lease, but he said that because he's on the diet, saved his life and changed his whole life, he said that I could live there as long as I wanted, even after he is dead.\n\n\r\nIn fact, he made a deal when he rented to lease the place to the rehab center of the clinic, that I stay there no matter what, but contract is on that house, the house is gone.\n\n That's it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou take it pretty good *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n What am I gonna do about it.\n\n I was upset for two hours?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTime for a change.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nScrew it.\n\n .\n\n .\n\n Can't worry about it.\n\n I'm here so little, so it's okay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre you packing your stuff up.\n\n Where are you gonna keep your stuff?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFred on his part of the land that he didn't lease to them he has a small storage house?\n\n He's gonna put everything there for me.\n\n And I've got three boxes that just has everything that I absolutely have to have.\n\n So, I'm not living like a hotel cuz that's basically, I live out of a suitcase for nine and a half months a year.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n Is that your plan just to come back here a month at a time or something.\n\n Three times a year?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that's the way I'm doing it now?\n\n I'm going away for four months and coming back for two to three months  and then going away again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you're building a house in the Philippines, aren't you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot yet?\n\n It hasn't started the one, it's all about to begin there, even though it's more remote and no roads into that area, no paved roads and I have to cross three rivers.\n\n We got caught in one of the rivers and almost got washed out into the oceans when he and I were there last August, but finally bought the property, finally went through in January.\n\n\r\nBecause it's 618 meters up the mountain and it's in forested land and they're very particular about everything.\n\n So, I had to get a permit and permission and have the town the developers, the city of Parto Princessa, their engineers designed the road because it's this steep sometimes.\n\n So, they had to build a road which was a half a mile up to Mountain to get to my property.\n\n It took them four months to build it and I had to get permission to take down the trees and.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's a process.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n It was a heck of a process.\n\n The property is about a half a mile long -  two-thirds of a kilometer going back, so it's a big piece of property.\n\n The one in Thailand's only 34 acres, and one in Philippines is 108 acres.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOnly 34 acres *laughs*.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, and 108 acres is one in Philippines.\n\n I needed a lake built at the end where I was gonna build a property because where it goes at that end, at the north end of the property, there's a river that runs down and some big waterfalls on it, and that runs all year round.\n\n Then along the back of the property there's a river that runs along the back and all along the other side.\n\n So, on three sides of the property, there are rivers.\n\n Now the one on the north end that is so big that that's government ownded, but my land goes right up to it.\n\n The one that's behind it on the other side is on my property.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat made you choose the Philippines.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it was the most remote area I could get without getting into hostility?\n\n\r\nIif I was gone toward Indonesia or Malaysia, there's a lot of hostility towards white people, so I didn't want to get into that and Filipinos love white people.\n\n I mean Americans.\n\n I don't know why.\n\n Huh.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey kept calling me Joe?\n\n \"Hey Joe\",  from G.\n\nI.\n\n Joe from the Vietnamese guys, or during the Vietnam War about the G.\n\nI.\n\ns.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you look at the Philippines, you've got the big island rezone here where Manila is and then you've got all these other islands that go off over here: Samar, and then you have some fairly large islands there, which are Baha, Sibu, Negros, and those are popular ones and then you have the big island denal here, here in Somal and all the little islands around that.\n\n\r\nThey're way over here.\n\n There's a Long Island and that's Prowa where I am, only 2% of the roads are paved.\n\n The town I live in there are 200 people and they're all spread out over about five miles, 200 people over a five mile area and they live off the land.\n\n There's no electricity.\n\n\r\nThey have electricity one and a half hours a day, and that's it because the city paid for a power thing for them to have electricity one and a half hours a day.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo they fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that's what they eat, it's right on the ocean there?\n\n On the place where I built my property was where the wind comes through because it's All Mountain there and I'm probably two-thirds of the way up the mountain and all the way up to close to the top of that first peak and it goes back about 12 miles to more mountains and that river runs 12 miles all the way down through my property.\n\n I only hiked three miles back to see how it was all the way back there and nothing back there, but monkeys.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDrinking water must be good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I drank right out of that stream?\n\n\r\nThey freaked out because they're told malaria.\n\n They'll get malaria from it.\n\n I was drinking and I was bathing in it, they were freaked out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe people who live there, do they have wells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey'll collect rain, they won't drink it out in the stream?\n\n\r\nThey're indoctrinated to believe that they're going to get some disease, they're gonna get malaria and it's a falsehood.\n\n They believe that mosquitoes get malaria too and so it's a joke, ridiculous.\n\n \r\nA little bitty mosquito is gonna bite you.\n\n Now think about this.\n\n Mosquito is a female, the only reason she drinks blood is to feed her offspring.\n\n She doesn't want that blood contaminated.\n\n She's not gonna contaminate you when they bite you.\n\n The proboscus goes in and it bites as many cells as it can, so creates a pool of blood.\n\n She sucks it out.\n\n No saliva involved in it or anything.\n\n It's a whole ridiculous joke.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, what about malaria.\n\n They say that's transmitted by?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n That's what I'm talking.\n\n It's a lie.\n\n Malaria comes from not eating enough protein and getting very sick in a humid climate, and they only eat like 5%, 10% meats.\n\n\r\nThe healthier ones that eat a lot because they're fishing around where I bought my property, there's a lot.\n\n But if you are one of the poorer people who has a big family,\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Aajonus Thai Property, Malaria Treatment \n \n \n \n \n### (4) Blood, Urine Ph \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, the body's always trying to balance itself\n\n Now there's a belief out there in the alternative community that we want anywhere from 6.\n\n7 - 7.\n\n2 blood acid to alkalinity ratio.\n\n However, in native tribes, it's anywhere from 5.\n\n2 - 5.\n\n8.\n\n\r\nMine has been 5.\n\n5 for however long I can remember and my blood, my urine, my saliva all around 5.\n\n5.\n\n If your alkaline, you're in trouble.\n\n The whole system works on an acidic basis.\n\n Most of our digestive juices, 90% - 95% of our digestive uses are acid.\n\n \r\nHydrochloric acid is 100% acidic, there's no alkalinity to it.\n\n It's about a 4.\n\n9 - 5.\n\n2.\n\n So, if it is highly alkanalized that means it's not going to work well to break down acidic tissue quickly, like meats, cheeses, any kind of meat, whether no matter if it's fish, foul, or four-legged animals, red meat.\n\n They will not break down and dissolve properly.\n\n\r\nAnd you only have 10% - 20% of your digestive acids are are part of digestion.\n\n 80% - 90% is supposed to be bacterial.\n\n So, your digestive acids are to break the larger particles of food into smaller particles so the bacteria can infiltrate it and eat it.\n\n Their waste is our food.\n\n So, we're really piss and shit eaters, technically that's what we are.\n\n So, that's 80% - 90% of digestion.\n\n \r\nIf it goes into alkalinityy like a cow or a horse or any herbivore, you are going to be a vegetarian and you're not going to live healthfully and well.\n\n So, that is a whole fallacy that a lot of the so-called early alternative thinkers in nutrition, they came up with a stupid idea, Walker and Fry, and all of them came up with that ridiculous tale.\n\n No evidence, no scientific evidence to prove it.\n\n They didn't test the saliva and the amount of bacteria that's necessary in the saliva to have proper digestion.\n\n \r\nIn healthy human beings, they have more bacteria in the mouth than dogs and cats do.\n\n So, we are supposed to be thriving with bacteria.\n\n Digestion starts in the mouth.\n\n  \r\nI don't have hydrochloric in the mouth cuz they severed my vagus nerve and that's what caused me a lot of tooth problems once I regenerated from the radiation therapy.\n\n But most people do not have a high hydrochloric acid content in their mouth.\n\n It's other acids.\n\n And you only have one small amount of ptyalin enzyme, which is the only alkalinizing enzyme in your mouth, and only the horse has that, and the horse uses a profuse amount of it.\n\n We seemed to develop it after being a grain eater for thousands of years because none of the tribes that have stuck with the native diet have traces of ptyalin in their mouths.\n\n\r\nSo, basically we should be an acidic body from top to bottom.\n\n There should be in this 6.\n\n7 - 7 alkaline acidic ratio.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's not true then that cancer cannot grow in an alkaline environment.\n\n?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all bullshit.\n\n I've seen thousands of people with that.\n\n I mean literally thousands at these clinics that feed 'em only vegetable juice and I watched them drop off dead, left and right dead even though they had that alkalinity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Brain Function, Drink Urine and Asparagus Juice and Emfs From Computer \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMore could I take to help brain function, like some work in phone, the computer thing\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou got a flat screen?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut I still find myself trying to reduce my time in front of the things.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, do you, do you have a tower or do you have a laptop.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I have a laptop?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo you have a separate keyboard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n You take an EMF meter and you put it over your computer.\n\n What model do you have.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have a MacBook Pro?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, so you're putting off right around 170 miligals, an electromagnetic field that's going up your hand into your brain all day long is going to dull your brain.\n\n\r\nSo, you need a separate keyboard and you keep the computer 9 - 10 inches away, the bottom of the computer has be 9 - 10 inches away from the top of the keyboard to not be in that field.\n\n \r\nWhen I first got a laptop, I moved into a house at the same time and I started having all of my bone problems that when I had leukemia bone cancer, multiple myeloma.\n\n And I thought I was getting it back.\n\n And when I went away on a trip all of it went away and I didn't take my computer with me and I still thought maybe it was the house.\n\n I didn't know what it was, and I still didn't put it together, called in an environmental special to check for raydon, anything in the house.\n\n Only thing he found was a high emf field coming off my laptop computer.\n\n \r\nHe says, get a separate keyboard.\n\n Got a separate keyboard.\n\n I went out that day.\n\n I didn't let him out of the house, I made him sell me his equipment, so I never had to call another guy again cause I'd be testing everything after that.\n\n So I did, it took me an hour to talk him out of his equipment cause that'd be another week before he could get them made and stuff.\n\n So anyway, I got them and I got the separate keyboard and sure enough all the pain went right away witin 24 hours.\n\n So, that's probably a lot of it, but if you want to stimulate your brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI was gonna say, besides the blueberries and cream, what else do I eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAsparagus tips and juice the stalks?\n\n You can eat about 2 - 3 inches of the asparagus tip and then juice the rest of the stalk.\n\n Now your pees gonna smell very strange, but disregard that.\n\n \r\nNow, what a lot of people do in India to increase brain function is they eat the asparagus like that and juice it, and then drink their urine after they have some kind of milk.\n\n We can do it after meat or anything like that and those particular proteins recycle that do the particular union that stimulates the brain.\n\n You may get let's say from eating asparagus and asparagus juice, you'll probably get a 15% - 20% increase in brain alertness, focus, however you drink your urine one time about six hours following having the asparagus as long as you've eaten a meat meal or had milk or eggs, then you will increase it like 20% - 27% brain function.\n\n\r\nSo, if you're really looking to stimulate the brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow would you have to drink.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends on how much you urinate?\n\n Probably when I've experimented with it, 1/2 cup was enough, 3/4 of a cup didn't change it much, just a little bit.\n\n\r\nCup didn't change anything from 3/4 of a cup.\n\n So, 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup.\n\n  \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Butter With Cheese \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou said when you eat cheese, eat butter with it because it's constipating\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSome people, yes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, to me I found that no matter how much butter I eat with it, it's constipating, and I eat plenty of butter with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you're getting constipated that way, you just don't have enough fat in your bowel.\n\n Those E.\n\ncoli are gonna hold it up.\n\n See, because cheese is already a moldy substance, at least our cheese that we get because it's grown in a cave, and that's the way you have a fungus that breaks down the cheese, it's like a yogurt.\n\n Only a fungus instead of a bacteria is breaking down your cheese so we digest it.\n\n\r\nSo, the fungus breaks it down so the E.\n\ncoli can get even more nutrients from it.\n\n So, it's gonna hold it up there longer, it doesn't dry you out more if you're eating butter with it.\n\n However, your E.\n\ncoli and your bowel are so hungry, then you need to feed it from the back end.\n\n And I told you this before, you have three tablespoons each of coconut cream, butter and dairy cream and shove it up in there.\n\n Leave it there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut that drops out and it dropped out all over my car seat.\n\n I think I told you that.\n\n And you have to wear a diaper really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n You do it at night before you go to sleep.\n\n I've never had it come out on anybody but you, that's the wildest thing.\n\n Don't put so much in then, put half of that amount in.\n\n And did you also get on your left side and roll or did you get down and bark *barks* and then after you get it in, you go down like this and you roll your stomach, so it'll move down into your colon so it won't stay in the sigmoid area.\n\n And then you can lie like this, roll your stomach a little bit and get it to move up here and then you can roll like this.\n\n You go over here to move over more so you can feed the E.\n\ncoli everywhere.\n\n \r\nSo, that's what you can do to prevent it from dumping because it sounds like yours is just staying in the sigmoid colon if it's doing that, you need to work it up higher.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow long would you do that for on the ground.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThree minutes?\n\n Whole thing would take three minutes.\n\n If you really want to get all the good fat over the whole colon to make sure every bit of it gets, then I would do it for about 10 minutes.\n\n Probably three minutes like this, rolling the stomach, then left side for about three minutes of the left side for about three minutes.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Cancer Cluster \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAround the middle there, but I was interested in like buying maybe a place down there or renting and somebody mentioned that, \"Oh, there's a cancer cluster here\"\n\n So, I wanted to ask you, do you know how you find out.\n\n I tried to find some information out?\n\n There's two cell towers there also, and there's also a cancer cluster here in Carlsbad.\n\n\r\nSo, I mean, they're saying it's either from water.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's cancer clusters everywhere now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know, but there's like 15 kids, five of 'em died here, right in Carlsbad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou give kid a vaccine the day he pops out, the kid's gonna have a 60% chance of getting cancer before he is a teenager.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut there's too many in one place.\n\n Don't you agree.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because they do a lot of experimenting, how much can they put in here?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much can they put what.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHow much can they put in the vaccine?\n\n How much of this, how much of that?\n\n\r\nThey're screwing around.\n\n The military does it.\n\n Our government does it.\n\n They they go to a certain area and they'll experiment with them.\n\n They did it with 1 million people in Mississippi and they're doing it all the time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you're saying if you live next to a power plant or if you live next to a military base.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're living next to a power plant, you're creating a higher risk of course.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you live near a power tower, you're going to take a risk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know.\n\n And now these damn cell tower things, they're everywhere.\n\n\r\nThey're popping up more and more.\n\n You cannot go down 94 or here, they're everywhere.\n\n And I don't know, a lot of people are saying that the frequencies are just too much for our bodies to.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey are.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, you have to go on the raw food diet to get help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYep, exactly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust to sustain because we're already so damn toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, we're already toxic.\n\n Definitely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Clay Binds With Toxins \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLondon everywhere, Paris, Brussels, everywhere in the world\n\n They went to see this guy and he said, \"I am not going to choose the poison, let a university doctor bring the arsenic, half a cup of arsenic and I will drink it in front of everybody and I'll show you that I live\".\n\n\r\nSo, he got people all the way, he made a fortune off of it and he drank a half a cup of arsenic, and until he died in the 1930s, he did not tell anybody how he did it.\n\n Now, in his deathbed, he said, \"I drank a half a cup of clay an hour before\".\n\n And if the arsenic went in, the clay absorbed it just like that.\n\n\r\nSo, you have a high histamine, eat some clay, let the clay help you.\n\n So, the, your body doesn't have to make the homocysteines so much.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Clay Causes Dryness \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you can't mix it here, what makes you think it's gonna mix it in the stomach\n\n You need to disperse it?\n\n The reason I don't like it is a lot of people in autopsies and people who eat clay, I've seen clay impactations.\n\n Places where dried up into their intestines, it just stayed there.\n\n\r\nThat meant that whole intestinal area didn't function.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you don't recommend using clay regularly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, but I'm saying you blend with milk?\n\n Mix in a fluid so it thins it so, it doesn't clump.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes it matter if the milk is cold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOf course?\n\n Always gotta be room temperature.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Cooked Fat Ideal Body Fat \n \n \n \n \n### (11) Dry Skin, Honey and Cheese Will Dry You \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSee how dry your skin is on your face\n\n That's how dry you are in your head?\n\n You're gonna leech fats and water from your eyes are gonna be deficient.\n\n The only way you can do that is you have to put lots of primal facial body care on your face daily, and you put honey and butter in your mouth frequently, just keep rolling it around.\n\n If you taste a toxic taste when you're rolling it around, spin it out.\n\n Get rid of those poisons.\n\n Put some fresh stuff in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, honey and butter, not honey and cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, honey and cheese will dry.\n\n Honey and butter.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll right, honey and butter and coconut cream on my face or the other facial cream that you-\r\n\n\r\nThe Primal Facial Body Care Cream and it's new and improved.\n\n Instead of using one third coconut cream, butter and dairy cream, you still use those, but now you cut them down to a fourth of the ingredients andadd bone marrow.\n\n So, it's a quarter bone marrow now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere do you get the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n I get it from North Star Bison?\n\n You can get a delivery when you get stuff from Cynthia.\n\n She gets it from Rawsome in Los Angeles.\n\n So, you can order it through her, or you order direct from North Star Bison and you get it popped out of the bone already, half the price.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, they have it without the bone.\n\n \r\nShe'll sell it without the bone?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n They'll sell it without the bone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI know you said Alicia should take that if she would.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow would she take that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust eat it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWith a meat meal or just anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWith a meat meal is always better, before a meat meal is always better?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd how much does she have.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAt least one of those bones a day?\n\n\r\nWhile  I'm in town, I eat a whole package.\n\n I eat 5 - 7 bones worth a day.\n\n So, I'm eating like about 1/2 cup bone marrow, even more, 3/4 of a cup if you press it down, so 1/2 - 3/4 of a cup of bone marrow I eat a day because I'm not in town much and I can't get it all the time,.\n\n So, when I'm here I power up on it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat's it called.\n\n Is it bone marrow without the bone?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Bone marrow without the bone.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou mentioned before that she vaccinates the female bison.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust the breeding ones, ones that breed offspring.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo you have to make a special request not to get the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI tell everybody THAT And she shot me an email about a month ago saying, \"I do not sell any of the bones or any of the meat, any of the product for my breeding females?\n\n When they die, I ship them off to the dump, you know, to the bear, which means it goes still goes to dog food or something like that.\n\n\r\nIt goes off for waste.\n\n It's not for human consumption.\n\n, anything.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Eggs Alone \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you only eat eggs, if you eat milkshakes, no\n\n**[unclear]**\n and then you might get a little irritable when you're only doing eggs.\n\n You're also gonna feel very dehydrated.\n\n So, you need to keep a little bit of butter in your mouth, throw honey/butter on your lips, or just honey.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, just to finish my question.\n\n Is it better not to force a down diet and just let your body do it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's always better to let your body do it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it better to stay on the dairy all the time, and then all of a sudden it'll lose weight or you just choose to stop doing the dairy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour body will stop you from eating for a while and detox heavily?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou just feel not hungry and not having dairy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen you start getting nauseous and your body's says, \"Wait a minute\"?\n\n Every time you put anything into it, you'll vomit.\n\n That's when the body is saying, \"We're gonna do something differently here\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, no forced down diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't need to.\n\n do that one.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhy did you used to do that down diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said, that was for people who were paranoid that they'd never lose the weight?\n\n So, if they did it for a year on and off, they could say, \"Oh, I can lose that weight\".\n\n And then they aren't as particular about it.\n\n\r\n\"Oh, I can lose that weight later.\n\n Oh, I can use that\".\n\n And that's what I like, them to postpone it, let their bodies do it.\n\n You know, people are very lazy when it comes toanything that takes stress and work.\n\n If the body wants that fat, you're not gonna get rid of it easily.\n\n Yeah.\n\n About that hole.\n\n Yeah.\n\n\r\nIt's not gonna let you.\n\n You have to work out, you have to limit what you eat.\n\n In the book and the recipe book, I have a weight loss program.\n\n So, they're eating frequently, but small amounts, and that's the only way you can get the body to agree to it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm getting it right here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd that's where you need it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUgh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhere do a lot of the toxins go.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what makes you hold fat?\n\n Regular nutrition says, \"Oh, insulin back, and all this stuff\"?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's all their bullshit to get you to take supplements.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight, so what actually signals your body to hold the fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour body is holding fats everywhere in the body because you have toxins in all the tissues, all the cells, the body wants to draw those poisons out?\n\n Or if they're moving out on their own, you'll have the fat there to arrest it right away.\n\n Won't do any damage.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's holding from the fat or calories.\n\n Is it actually from fat you're eating or is it from calories.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you're not eating butter with your meat, your body will make fats from the protein, but if you're eating fats with your meat, it's not gonna use the meat that way?\n\n And if you're eating a fat, your body won't convert any fruits unless you're eating a quart of blueberries a day, then your body will make fat with it sugar.\n\n Even if you're eating a lot of fat, it won't do that even.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd I sometimes do not lose weight even if I go off dairy.\n\n Your body just choices.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour body wants to hold it if you have toxins in your tissues.\n\n That's why I like everybody to be fat if they're sick.\n\n You'll have protection.\n\n If you don't have protection, what's gonna happen when those toxins get free.\n\n They're gonna do more damage?\n\n Can you imagine internally, like you had the toxin come out and dry out the skin and cause itching.\n\n\r\nIt'll do that internally and you can't scratch it and you can't apply butter on it directly?\n\n You're gonna have to eat a ton of butter to get there or a lubrication/moisturizing formula and a lot of it to get there.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Gerson Raw Liver, Heart, Plaque Test, Blood Sugar, Etc \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSomebody, what was his name\n\n Put it out there?\n\n Walker and Gerson was into your raw liver.\n\n That was the main thing, raw liver.\n\n You can't get alkaline with raw liver.\n\n Raw liver is 90% protein, very little fat in the liver.\n\n It's like the heart.\n\n Those two organs, the heart and the liver are basically your major protein bodies in the system and they're highly acidic, so Gerson, when he was around, 60% of his diet was raw liver.\n\n \r\nNow that his daughter's taking it over, she's removed the liver, and these people are dying just like every other vegetarian regime.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, it's a consequence of being too acidic that your body will want to buffer that system.\n\n\r\nI mean, if you're too alkaline, your body's gonna wanna make it as acidic.\n\n Does that mean it's gonna be dumping positive ions into the blood, like the minerals from your bones.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh yeah, it's going to take it from everywhere it can?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike contributing to osteoporosis then by being too alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Yeah, it definitely will.\n\n That's why so many vegetarian and Fruitarians have bone degeneration.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut doesn't the body leach calcium from the bones to alkalize the blood.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPardon?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIsn't the the calcium leached from the bones to alkalize the blood?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's to bind with toxins?\n\n It's to neutralize, let's say you have something cooked and in it you've got acidic compounds, which are free radical: mercury, lead, cadmium.\n\n Any of those toxic metals, the body will use the calcium to neutralize those because they're free radical acid minerals, not because they're in proper ionic bond and proportion like in a raw diet, very different.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCalcium is an alkaline mineral, correct.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCalcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium are the ones that we mainly use to neutralize free radical acids?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThey need an acidic environment to be properly used.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n If you didn't have calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium, we wouldn't be alive.\n\n But our ratio needs to be right around 5.\n\n5 - 5.\n\n7.\n\n Not 7, not 6.\n\n7.\n\n That's an herbivore, become a cow next life if you want that.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhen I have a cold, I've been told to have a glass of eight ounces of water and put half a teaspoon of baking soda in there to alkaline, instead of keeping it acid.\n\n But baking soda is an acid.\n\n How can it alkaline your body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou got me *laughs*?\n\n You got me.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nIs that a good thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNope?\n\n Baking soda's a very nasty thing.\n\n It acts like ascorbic, it will leach fats out of the blood.\n\n So yeah, you'll reduce your symptoms, but you won't get well.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat about apple cider vinegar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nApple cider vinegar is very helpful?\n\n A lot of the amino acids that you use in chelation therapy are in the apple cider vinegar.\n\n\r\nSo, if you want a chelation therapy, take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar a day.\n\n\r\nSo, the body will leach calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium out of your bones to help neutralize over acidity from cooked foods or poison, but not from raw foods.\n\n You'll never have over acidity from it when you've been on long enough and healthy.\n\n \r\nRight now I'm down to- when I do it one juice a day.\n\n I haven't had a juice for three weeks.\n\n I don't have to worry about that over acidity anymore very often.\n\n \r\nWhen I get into the tropics, I do more because I perspire more, so I will drink more vegetable juice when I'm in the tropics.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWho would one on a cooked diet rather be acidic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends?\n\n If they're a vegetarian, they're going to be highly alkaline and toxic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut on a cooked diet, would one be acidic or alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSad American diet?\n\n Standard American diet?\n\n A sad diet?\n\n They're gonna be overly acidic if they don't.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n So are they better off being slightly alkaline.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if they're eating enough alkaline foods to promote, they'll never be alkaline without pouring vegetable and fruit juices into yourself?\n\n That's why these clinics have you drinking like a gallon and a half, two gallons of vegetable and fruit juices daily cuz you cannot get alkaline.\n\n The body will resist it and finally when you do, it's broken down and exhausted.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you check to see what your PH is.\n\n How do you know?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I know because I used one of those strips and also I had medical doctors once in a while, like at St?\n\nLouis, uh, in St.\n\n Louis, Washington University Medical Center did a rundown on people who were raw fooders and I was one of the test subjects and I was the healthiest one that they'd known, but I was only one of three people who were not vegetarian raw fooders.\n\n So, I outperformed in all of them every everywhere.\n\n\r\nAnd this was a famous cardiac doctor for athletes.\n\n You're talking about big time athletes who make professional basketball teams, football teams and stuff like that.\n\n He's the doctor formost of those big, full-time stars when it comes to cardiac therapy and analysis and on one of the floors of the hospital, they have a tracj and all kinds of workout equipment, pumping the iron.\n\n And they took me, they did all the blood tests with me cuz I told 'em I was eating at least a stick of butter a day and lots of meat.\n\n Oh, cholesterol galore and this is a heart doctor.\n\n \r\nSo, he said, \"I'll pay your way here.\n\n I'll pay everything,come\".\n\n So, I went there on my way to St.\n\n Louis to do a workshop in St.\n\n Louis for Jeff and people there in St.\n\n Louis.\n\n So, I spent a day there through the tests.\n\n They only found a little bit of blockage here, a little bit of caking in this artery, but that was since I was a little kid.\n\n\r\nSince I found it was still there, started using vinegar to help break it down, so it's probably broken down by now because this was like 6 years ago since I did that test.\n\n And after all the tests, the doctor was so amazed at my condition and the blood results, everything.\n\n\r\nI mean, they gave me a glucose tolerance, that's the first time I had sugar since 1974.\n\n So, I was like this, gave me high blood pressure, everything.\n\n But still, the test results came out phenomenal.\n\n So he said, can we do some more tests on you.\n\n Sign these waivers?\n\n So, it was just athletic stuff.\n\n So, he took me, I ran around the track about seven times, just about a quarter of a mile without stopping, without resting.\n\n\r\nAnd my heartbeat was normal within 90 seconds.\n\n He said he'd never seen that before and then they put me on pumping iron and I said, \"I don't exercise, I haven't exercised since 1979\".\n\n So he said, \"Okay, we'll take it easy on you\".\n\n Then he took it too easy.\n\n Start off 20 pounds, weight, 20 pounds each time going up.\n\n\r\nAnd then when he got up to high, there was 10 pounds increase on time.\n\n I said, \"Would you come on with this.\n\n I'm gonna be Arnold Schwartzenegger just on the end of this day\"?\n\n So we got up to, I got 240 pounds with the leg presses and when he saw me even slightly strained, he stopped me.\n\n He didn't want me to have a heart attack.\n\n\r\nSo, 240 pounds there.\n\n Got up to 195 before I started straining on the bench press.\n\n Stop me right there and I could have done it, probably gone up to about 210-230, but he stopped and he said, \"I've never seen anything like this before.\n\n We have people who work out here three days a week and they can't do what you do\".\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI wonder what he did with that information.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe's probably doing what the Austrians do, like Arnold Schwartz, raw eggs, raw milk, raw meats.\n\n It's probably what he's doing with it.\n\n \r\nNo, he's not gonna be out there against anybody, but he's gonna have his secrets with his athletes and he'll make more money out of it.\n\n It's usually their intention.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Goat Milk Hyperactive & Over Sexual \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAre there goats over there\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLots of goats?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you prefer cows.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't do well with goats milk?\n\n I get hyperactive and overly sexual.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCause it's a more energetic animal.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You ever seen a skinny, calm goat\r\nI don't need those adrenaline precursors.\n\n If I were an athlete or somebody who enjoyed being physical, then it would be fine if I want to do things, instead of being mentally focused and I'm a mentally focused individual.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) High Homocysteine \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI think my doctor's concerned about a elevated homocystine level\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's some more drug selling.\n\n Homocysteines are created to take care of toxins, so it shows that you have a high toxic level.\n\n Whenever you have an allergy to something, something can harm something in the body, your body will build homocysteines to resist and handle it.\n\n\r\nThat's a good thing.\n\n It's like bacteria's a janitor, that's a kind of a janitor.\n\n So, it shows, yes, you have toxins in your body that are moving and your body's building a lot of homocystine to deal with that so you don't get sick, and so you remove it properly.\n\n It is a sign that you've got a problem, but not a problem to lower it, and that's what they do.\n\n\r\nJust remember the doctors don't make money if you're well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, ignore it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIgnore it?\n\n Completely ignore it.\n\n After chemotherapy, my homocystine level was off the chart.\n\n My nutritionist said, \"Ignore it\".\n\n It's your body working against as an allergy to something in the body and it is not the raw food.\n\n It is something already in the body that's toxic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat is homocystine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHomocystine is a hormonal protein substance that helps bind with certain kinds of toxins?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI read an article about people or men who have a irregular heartbeat and stuff like that should have homocysteine tests, but I don't know if it should be high or low.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, they're looking for a low homocysteine.\n\n If you have a high homocysteine, it shows you have a lot of toxins moving through the body at a particular time, and that can cause the heartbeat to increase and be irregular.\n\n That does not mean the homocystine is causing it.\n\n No, the toxins causing it.\n\n\r\nThe homocystine will keep you from having a heart attack.\n\n It's not.\n\n You take the homocystine out and you're gonna have a heart attack if that toxin is free to move on its own, and it imbeds in the heart, you end up with a charley horse.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou have to find out how to regulate that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you just leave your body alone and eat properly?\n\n Your body will always seek a proper level if you're eating properly.\n\n Unless, let's say you drank half a cup of arsenic, all the homocysteine in the world isn't gonna prevent it.\n\n \r\nYou remember that guy back in the late 1800s that put out that he's gonna drink a half a cup of arsenic and he publicized it 6 - 12 months ahead of time all over the world.\n\n \r\nSo, they had reporters from London everywhere, Paris, Brussels, everywhere in the world.\n\n They went to see this guy and he said, \"I am not going to choose the poison, let a university doctor bring the arsenic, half a cup of arsenic and I will drink it in front of everybody and I'll show you that I live\".\n\n\r\nSo, he got people all the way, he made a fortune off of it and he drank a half a cup of arsenic, and until he died in the 1930s, he did not tell anybody how he did it.\n\n Now, in his deathbed, he said, \"I drank a half a cup of clay an hour before\".\n\n And if the arsenic went in, the clay absorbed it just like that.\n\n\r\nSo, you have a high histamine, eat some clay, let the clay help you.\n\n So, the, your body doesn't have to make the homocysteines so much.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSo, what do you think of those basic tests that they tell you, like Dr.\n\n Oz and everybody on TV says, go ahead like c-reactive protein as, as far as inflammation in the body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhat are they selling.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI don't know what he's selling?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're selling something, that's what it's all about.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHe's a md so I mean, and he's one of the good ones.\n\n You know what I, what I'm saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, he thinks he's a good guy?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI saw Dr.\n\n Oz pushing the flu vaccine.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI know, he's not all there.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nTo me, they don't know better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, they know.\n\n When you've been a doctor for 10 years.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\n He's a cardiologist.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't make any difference, when you see people getting worse instead of better every time you treat them, that's a bad sign.\n\n That's why now they don't make you swear in the Bible or anything when they take the Hippocratic oath.\n\n You just stand there and take it, no raising of your hand or anything.\n\n You just repeat it.\n\n You have to say it aloud, there's no swearing.\n\n\r\nI mentioned that to a doctor and he said, \"Well, I didn't swear on it.\n\n If I swore on that, I couldn't use any medication, any medicine\".\n\n So, they know what they're doing.\n\n If they're 10 years into the business, they know what they're doing and that includes once they get out of their internship in a hospital, they pretty much know that they're the bad guys.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd that's why people like Dr.\n\n**[unclear]**\n go away from them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n \r\nBut they still carry all that fear and training with them, they don't get out of it.\n\n They've gotta do something to help the body and they don't know there ass from a hole in the ground.\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Unclear]**\n\r\n\n, is he a doctor.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, hes an md?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHe's kind of more away from the.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe's still into antibiotics, but he's more into prayer, not doing something about it.\n\n More favorable.\n\n He's into mind over matter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Hot Springs Sport Formula, Watermelon \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd the fruit, you said have that for 30 days, the strawberries, raspberries, and watermelon\n\n Is that like a fruit meal and then after the 30 days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat, what do I do.\n\n Do I replace it or?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I want to see how you are at that time?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut you're not gonna be here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can email me.\n\n You have the same symptoms, then you stay on it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust continue.\n\n Okay.\n\n And when you go to the hot springs, you're talking about the special sport formula you gave to me, but there's no pineapple before that, right.\n\n You don't take the pineapple drink If I'm going to the hot spring?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you're going to a health spa like a Glen Ivy and you're gonna spend the whole day right,  it's best to take a lot of watermelon?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust watermelon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWatermelon helps you perspire better than any other food?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd do you take cream with that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can?\n\n Yeah, that's what I do.\n\n Let's say I'm gonna have a round slice of watermelon that's about this thick and this round, that'll fill me up.\n\n That's about a cup and a half, I don't eat the hard, nothing around where the seeds are, but I eat all rind and red from the, where the seeds begin down, unless it's a really young watermelon, not sweet.\n\n Then I eat the whole thing.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you have some cream with that you said.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, take probably three tablespoons of cream before I have that much?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBefore you get into the hot springs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I'll do this before I get into the springs, and then while I'm there, I'll eat a little bit of watermelon all throughout the day.\n\n\r\nLike every hour I'll have a 1/2 cup or more, depending on how much I'm perspiring.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSometimes you can't tell cuz you're in there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI know.\n\n Well, in the mud pool, it's lukewarm.\n\n It's maybe 102°, 101°.\n\n That doesn't really cause much perspiration I jsut go in with the mud and then I'll go from that.\n\n I'll clean off to clean the mud and I leave it in the tub.\n\n I don't get out and shower it off.\n\n I leave it in that pool so I can get it muddier, so when I go back in, it's muddy.\n\n \r\nIn fact, when I'm the first one there, when I used to go there mm-hmm.\n\n I would start packing mud in that.\n\n I would start mixing it in the water while it's on me and keep getting you wet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, you were that guy that I saw there doing that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMay have been, who knows.\n\n So, I get it very muddy and then I spend maybe an hour, an hour and a half in the mud bath and then I would go into the hot springs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I don't go, I go to Warner Springs and I like it out there a lot.\n\n The pool is sometimes 101° - 104°.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) How To Test Body Fat \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAll women should be 27 - 30% body fat\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you know what your body fat is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are different ways to tell?\n\n The absolute perfect way is you immerse yourself in a swimming pool that has a certain electromagnetic field that reads it.\n\n\r\nWithin 1% - 2%, there are scales.\n\n You put your weight and your height and then you get up on it and it has a way of measuring your body fat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with weight, how much you weigh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it figures it out?\n\n It's a calculus formula, but I'm not gonna go into that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Is Urien Detoxing, Ammonia \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm wondering, like the clay, does it have a detoxifying effect on the body as well\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, it's mainly a recycling?\n\n It does have one element that's for detoxification, that's the ammonia.\n\n Ammonia is a good detoxifier.\n\n \r\nLike after I got those forced injections, I went for shark and I couldn't cause it's high ammonia.\n\n Every day that a shark has been killed it doubles in ammonia, stingray does the same thing.\n\n So, I found a stingray, so I ate stingray for 24 hours.\n\n It was so much ammonia, and that Stingray was probably a day old already, and I had it.\n\n By the time I finished it, it was 36 hours old.\n\n So I was hallucinating.\n\n I was passing out, I was short of breath.\n\n\r\nI had all kinds of problems from too much amonia, too much ammonia can kill you, but I needed to bind with those poisons quickly.\n\n So, I used ammonia for that purpose to bind with toxic metals and substances that were foreign to the body.\n\n So, I used it in that way and when you're having urine, you have a little bit of ammonia in it, so it can help detoxify, but mainly you're recycling all of your fats, proteins, and all the rich nutrients that are in the blood because the urine is nothing other than everything that's in the blood without all the red and white blood cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow do you get to that point of drinking it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI did it when I was a vegetarian and I had to recycle my proteins cuz I got too skinny; skinnier and skinnier?\n\n I was almost evaporated.\n\n Somebody told me about India, they drink milk, but they're vegetarians, basically.\n\n And they drink their urine at least once a day to recycle those proteins that they don't get because they don't get because they don't eat meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI thought urine was very toxic though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's only as toxic as your diet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut see, if we have a sad diet, then we're pretty toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if we drank our urine, wouldn't that be counterproductive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFor some people it isn't?\n\n They don't get any protein unless they have it that way.\n\n In India, vegetarians, even though they are on cooked diets, at least the proteins will be recycled and utilized.\n\n\r\nI wouldn't do it if I were a cooked food eater.\n\n I'd vomit from cooked food anyway.\n\n So, I can imagine what would happen if I drank my urine, recycled the cooked food product.\n\n Who knows what would happen.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Liver and Kidney Problems, Egg White and Butter In Eyes \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, I have dark around here and I thought it was from the glaucoma drops, but the nutritionist that I've talked to, he said my liver and kidneys are stressed\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the dark is a sign of liver.\n\n if you had puffy eyes, it would be a sign of kidney problems too, but you don't have puffy eyes.\n\n\r\nYou have darkness.\n\n That shows some liver difficulties.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo I have to do something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, of course, but I wouldn't do anything special?\n\n Just go into my book and look up liver, because there's quite a few things you can do about the liver.\n\n Also with your eyes, egg white in your eyes.\n\n Butter in your eyes also.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRub it in.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what you do is either a little dab of either egg white or butter and you pull the side down and you put it along the white and then you hold both up and you roll it around like you're a circus master and that's it?\n\n And that soothes the eyes.\n\n In fact, it restores vision in a lot of circumstance.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n That was the other piece I wanted to ask you about vision, cuz I had LASIK surgery, but now I just used these for sort of reading or computer or whatever, and I'm feeling like these are 200s, I need to get something a little stronger and so, so to help that I can-\r\n\n\r\nWell,  I used to just say egg white and then I had a patient who had coke bottle thick glasses and she was determined cuz I got her excited on the diet and everything was working for her better than she was a rich girl.\n\n\r\nI mean, this girl.\n\n A hundred million dollars when she was 20 years old, so she doesn't have to think about a thing so she can play with anything, so she doesn't have to work.\n\n So, she sits at home doing all these different things, experimenting.\n\n So she was putting butter in her eyes twice daily.\n\n Her prescription would cut in half in seven months.\n\n\r\nI was impressed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas she on the on the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n Completely.\n\n 100%.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould that help the pressure of your eye or anything like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt can help anything?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe raw certified.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, no salt.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut you said honey with cheese can make the toxins reabsorbed though, Correct.\n\n \r\nYou shouldn't have honey with cheese?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUnless it's after a meat meal and you want to that cheese to be your mineral supplement?\n\n So, after a meat meal, about 35 minutes after a meat meal, you eat cheese and honey together twice daily for a mineral supplement.\n\n All the other times you eat it without honey to absorb poisons.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Living On Fish, Need More Fat, A1 Milk Not As Good \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAsians on the Philippine Islands live just on fish and they don't eat a lot of it\n\n Maybe a pound a day, and they're built and their stocky, but I just can't survive on it.\n\n I have to go find big fat strips of meat hanging, and I'll buy a whole five pounds of it and I'll eat two pounds a day if I don't have my butter.\n\n\r\nIf I have my butter I can have a stick a day, half a stick a day and do okay, but when I don't, I have to have a tremendous amount of fat.\n\n But when I had that milk, it wasn't quite nourishing.\n\n It didn't take care of it like the A2 milk does and it was repeated, I did it three times with the same milk from the same cows, the Holsteins from New Zealand and it was that way each time.\n\n And as soon as I went to a place with jerseys or other A2 cows it was perfectly fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEven in that climate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEven in that climate?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I was just gonna say you think it was just more of a climate, like what you were talking about earlier with how it's sort of naturally homogenized and all that kind of stuff.\n\n\r\nBut I mean clearly there's plenty of Holstein cows in the states that people have consumed raw milk on and improved their health.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDefinitely.\n\n But I can tell it isn't as good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you think it's just simply the jersey cow is so much richer and fattier and that's kind of where it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI think that's probably it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMore so than the whole A1, A2 micromanagement.\n\n Just the Jersey cows really fat milk and the holstein lean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I've had Holstein milk before, but not in that climate, so I don't know for sure?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Malaria \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe malaria story and you made the coconut water, lemon and honey concoction\n\n \r\nThat made me think of a question.\n\n Then you mentioned the a1, a2 thing on the milk.\n\n So, that was the question.\n\n While you were telling your malaria story, Stacy had told me when she was in the  Thailand several years ago, they were telling her, this is just a further illustrate the ridiculousness of these malaria mosquito bite stories.\n\n So take it away.\n\n**[Stacy]**\n\r\nIf you got bitten by a mosquito during the daytime, you would get malaria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\nAnd just think about it.\n\n What do mosquitoes eat.\n\n They eat nectar?\n\n They pollinate the tiny little flowers the bee got on it would crush the flower, the whole plant, like tiny little micro clover and stuff like that.\n\n\r\nThat's what mosquitoes do, they pollinate tiny little flowers.\n\n They don't eat shit, so how are you gonna get dengue fever.\n\n Hello?\n\n**[Stacy]**\n\r\nThey were ready to kill each other out of paranoia, out of, they were like delusional on the medication?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And what happened three years ago with that English boy, he came over, took the malaria every day.\n\n He got malaria and died?\n\n Famous British citizen, so it went all over the place and it's documented in his diary how he took the medication every day, died of malaria.\n\n So, it's all horseshit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, the concoction, the coconut water, lemon, lime.\n\n I was just gonna say, you'd mentioned a protein deficiency.\n\n That certainly is not a protein-rich concoction.\n\n \r\nWhat's going on during the so-called malaria that they're calling it is a detox of what.\n\n What are these people's detoxing?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHighly acidic proteins?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike their cooked meats you mean.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, like their cooked meats, they also use a lot of spices, a lot of hot spices, and when you're low in protein and you're doing that you cause internal burning all over the place?\n\n And when you're detoxing that much at one time, it's a huge detoxification.\n\n It's worse than pneumonia.\n\n Because pneumonia you're not usually passing out and delirious.\n\n Most people aren't.\n\n\r\nBut when you're going through malaria, you're delirious.\n\n Everything's going crazy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, so it's just a crazy detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nExtreme detox.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nExtreme detox brought on by a climate, you don't see malaria and dry climates really.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n it's cuz you detox better in a high hot climate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n So, if those people were eating the way you eat, there wouldn't be any.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And also you got higher fevers in a tropical environment So, your fever's gonna get higher and you're gonna have more symptoms of delirium.\n\n**[Stacy]**\n\r\nSo, the coconut water and that cools the system.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what it basically does is help the body alkanize the over acidity from the deteriorating tissue?\n\n\r\nWhen you eat a lot of hot, spicy food, it causes over over acidity and not a good acidity, an abrasive vicinity.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Milkshakes Vs Eggs Alone \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can put on lots of weight that way\n\n See it takes milk 6 - 10 hours to digest.\n\n So once you put it into the milk, it slows everything down.\n\n I make sure I digest it within 27 minutes because I will break the egg and I suck out the egg white, I dent the end without putting a hole in it, the fatter end and then the narrow end, I'll punch the hole in it and I'll hold it down like this and I'll suck it gently.\n\n Only the egg white comes out first and then the egg whites digests very rapidly cuz it isn't fat.\n\n You're have to have the bile, takes longer for bile of work on it.\n\n\r\nWe don't need any hydrochloric acid for the egg white cuz it's already liquid.\n\n All we need to do is get the bacteria working, so I keep the egg white in my mouth until it's completely water and I know it's full of bacteria.\n\n And then I swallow it and then the egg yolk will go last.\n\n And of course the, your body kind of layers things as it goes in.\n\n\r\nIt kind of layers itself, so it moves that way.\n\n So, the yolk comes in behind and the yolk will digests much faster by itself too, as well as the egg white will.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs it okay to leave the umbilical cord out of the egg.\n\n Can you not eat that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSure?\n\n .\n\n Just good protein.\n\n That's probably the only thing in it that has stem cells and you want to get rid of them, but that's okay.\n\n\r\nI'll take 'em.\n\n You collect them and send them to me.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan't you get rapid weight loss from eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes you can?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Morgellons, Skin, Miltary Putting Tiny Bugsin Your Skin \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike getting something underneath in my armpits, and I think it's more morgellons\n\n It gets like a rash and it's very itchy and it's just weird.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre there fibers in it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI haven't noticed any kind of fibers?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThen it's not morgellons.\n\n Jjust remember, 90% of toxins leave through the skin.\n\n\r\nYou're always going to get eruptions.\n\n Anytime you're detoxifying.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd even if it's really itchy, huh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nItchy just means that the poison is so toxic that it's robbed the fats out of the surrounding cells, so they're drying up and that's the itch?\n\n So, you put the primal facial body care cream on, or some bone marrow or butter.\n\n\r\nDefend the cells.\n\n Make sure the cells have enough fat to be pulled from when the toxin comes.\n\n through.\n\n Because if there's not enough fat and the only fat that that cell has is inside of itself, if it gives it up, it's going to dry out just like you would.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut there's no cure from more morgellons.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, clay helps?\n\n Well, I got it from these three injections.\n\n So, I had fibers and little insects coming outta my skin like crazy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen did they come out.\n\n When would you see those?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt was about probably a week after I got injected?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, really.\n\n Wow?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\ncan you explain morgellons.\n\n I've never heard of that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a condition where the body's detoxing through the skin fibers with insects attached.\n\n Now where the military has been using this as a war tool since about the late 1950s, they put like fly eggs and they embed them in these fibers.\n\n So, they go around spraying them in the air, they disperse them somehow in the air.\n\n\r\nIt's mostly from aerial spraying and people inhale these, the fiber gets absorbed into the tissue, the egg hatches.\n\n So, you've got a live fly this tiny little microscopic fly living on, and for some reason, it's like legs are entwined in the fibers and it can't get loose.\n\n So, it does tremendous damage as it comes to the skin.\n\n\r\nAll of these scars that you see on here, all of these were from that occurrence and I've got some big ones.\n\n These here like bullet holes.\n\n You can see these here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou actually see them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, definitely?\n\n Look at em over a microscope.\n\n Have lots of them from that those 3 injections.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike a scab.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Well, it doesn't come out like a scab at first.\n\n Comes out like a very inflamed sore.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n So, now you're completely over it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I don't have it?\n\n Well, I'll get a breakoutm maybe once every two months they'll start coming out.\n\n You can see all these.\n\n Thousands of 'em all over my body.\n\n\r\nSo, I've got all these tiny little scars.\n\n At first they weren't tiny, they were big like this one, but this was, see this size right here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThis was five times bigger than that a year ago when it came out.\n\n This little one here was five times that size last year.\n\n So, they're shrinking little by little.\n\n\r\nThese over here were even larger.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo just your diet alone-.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTook care of It, yeah?\n\n \r\nI ate more clay than I'd ever done before.\n\n A lot of clay.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike more than a tablespoon a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, sometimes I had three tablespoons a day.\n\n Break it up.\n\n Four ounces of milk, tablespoon of the clay three times daily.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd what else did you do, Aajonus.\n\n Because you look so much better from the last time when I saw you?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm just eating more clay.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Muscle Gain, Cheesecake \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nOur main milk producer in the state, he has almonds and he refuses to pasteurize his\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, does locally a cream of the crop, those almonds.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNot the ones that are organic, raw.\n\n They told me it, it says on there something, but then he told me the law is in California they have to be pasteurized.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but he doesn't do it to his, maybe the ones he sells to a regular market he'll go through the processprocess.\n\n But give hima call and see.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd then there's the ones from Italy, but they're probably not pasteurized.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIif they're allowed in the California, they have to be pasteurized.\n\n\r\nCalifornia doesn't want you healthy.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhat if one wants to body build.\n\n Just produce more muscle and stuff?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCheese, butter and honey helps put on weight fast, muscle weight?\n\n I started eating a lot more, um, cheese, honey and butter cuz I don't wanna work out.\n\n So, then I started putting on a lot more muscle cuz I got really skinny last year.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, basically cheesecake.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but I get tired of cheesecake cuz it's exactly the same taste every mouthful?\n\n But sometimes the honey goes in first and then you get to mix them in your mouth.\n\n\r\nSo, it's a whole different, it's a smorgasborg of flavors, , but if you don't have time, then it's better to have the cheesecake and you grab it and eat it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) New Primal Facial Body Cream, Bone Marrow \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Primal Facial Body Care Cream, it's new and improved\n\n Instead of using one third cream coconut cream butter and dairy cream, you still use those.\n\n But now you cut them down to a fourth of the ingredients and add bone marrow.\n\n So, it's a quarter bone marrow now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere do you get the bone marrow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI get it from North Star Bison?\n\n You can get a delivery from Cynthia, when you get her stuff, she gets it from Rawsome in Los Angeles.\n\n So, you can order it through her, or you order direct from North Star Bison and you get it popped out of the bone already, half the price.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, they have it without the bone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, they'll sell it without?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Oysers \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I just need some clarification on a couple of things you told me to eat\n\n The oysters, you said three a day.\n\n Is that just for 30 days and then do you just stop or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can do it longer than that, but I'm saying it's probably gonna take at least 30 days?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd same for Alicia too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nProbably hers will be okay in 30 days?\n\n She just has a spot of it here in her brain.\n\n You've got this iodine all over.\n\n The only place you don't have much is in this area right here.\n\n This area hit a little in the right side of your back, otherwise you're just coated with iodine.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd the oysters will get rid of that, huh.\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (27) Phosphorus Is Cauterized At 98 Degrees, Calcium ,poatassium \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nQuality, not quantity\n\n So, lemme just talk acid and alkaline.\n\n Your raw liver you said is acidic, red meats acidic and those are like quality.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n And the acids are proper balance.\n\n If you cook it, then it becomes overly acidic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nImbalanced.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, when you cook anything, phosphorus is destroyed and altered as little as 98°.\n\n\r\nThat's why they can tell whether something is pasteurized or.\n\n If the phosphorus is cauterized, they say it's been pasteurized and you can pasteurize at 121° and see that the phosphorus is cauterized.\n\n Normal pasteurization temperature is at 141°, usually potassium starts cauterizing about 170° and that means it's really not usable.\n\n \r\nCalcium becomes cauterized, 50% of it in pasteurized milk is destroyed.\n\n It's already cauterized, so it's unutilizable.\n\n \r\nSo, when you cook something, it breaks down and destroys the alkalinity, so there's no balance,\r\nThe acid minerals.\n\n They have a tolerance, a labile point that can be hundreds of degrees.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThen the other question I'd ask you, you briefly alluded to that whole a1 a2 thing and I've read stuff about that.\n\n I almost kind of chalked that up as you might say more laboratory kind of theory and all that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, so did I until I started drinking that milk from an A1 cow and the Holstein, and I noticed that it made me slight nauseous, I didn't have as much energy, it certainly tasted good and I felt better with it than without it being in Asia for a long time.\n\n I ran out of butter and I was about three weeks out of butter and I was hungry and the coconut cream is just not an animal fat and I would eat tons of fish, I could eat three pounds of fish a day and still not got to get enough fat for me because of all the stuff I've been through.\n\n My particular body needs a tremendous amount of fat.\n\n**[This is continued, just search the tag \"a2\" or \"milk\" + \"allergies\"]**\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Roller Ball Mosue Better Than Infrared \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDid you mention the mouse also\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe mouse, it has to be a roller ball and the only company that makes a roller ball mouse is Dell?\n\n The infrared, 75 milligals minimum in your hand.\n\n I got with my laptop that I got three years ago, Ferrari Acer, had a mouse to match everything with the Ferrari emblem on it so it looked black and red, really neat looking.\n\n\r\nAnd I used that for about three hours and my arm and hand were aching.\n\n I'm really sensitive cuz all the radiation therapy that I had and I couldn't believe it.\n\n You got an infrared and it's got a high electromagnetic field.\n\n It didn't make any sense at all, but it was high, so I got my old roller ball out.\n\n Next day, no problem.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nDo they still sell them, Dell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Dell is the only one.\n\n Nobody that makes them sells them.\n\n They have the roller ball mouse.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Stiff Joints ,toxins, Leaky Gut, Arthitis, Caly With Milk \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA couple things\n\n Stiffness, like in my joints and then my legs are getting like stiff.\n\n I've never had that before.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's called aging *laughs*.\n\n\r\nThose are toxins building up in the joints for so many years, and that's what happens.\n\n \r\nWhen they mean you're aging, you're building up toxins over the years and there's lots of things that live in the joints.\n\n Especially as thin as you were when I met you, you were thin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYour body seeks the place where there's fat, that's the brain and the bone marrow.\n\n It's the only place where there's heavy fat.\n\n So, your bone marrow gets filled with all these poisons.\n\n When it discards, where does it leave.\n\n The joints, all the joints?\n\n Causes arthritis and rheumatism.\n\n \r\nAlso, if you had a digestive problem like Crohn's disease and you had leaky gut, those particles of food go to the joints and the body builds acids there to become a digestive tract and starts eating the joints away.\n\n That's what arthritis and rheumatism is.\n\n 90% of rheumatism comes from leaky gut.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, more smoothies.\n\n Hot baths?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMore baths, heat at night, hot water bottles on the joints?\n\n More circulation in those areas to clean it.\n\n \r\nMore nutrients in an area means more detoxification and and more healing.\n\n \r\nClay is helpful.\n\n Usually a lot of metals because when you get a vaccine and most people, 70% of it will go to the stomach lining and 30% will go to the bone marrow.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nPut it on the skin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEat it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nClay in milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou make the soft, like I said, in the Recipe Book, you make the moist clay?\n\n \r\nUse like 3/4 cup of a cup of clay, 3/4 cup of water, so you got a cup and a half made.\n\n Let it sit for 4 - 5 days to get everything- the bacteria and the microorganisms going.\n\n\r\nClay is the only shape shifter that we know, organisms in it are shape shifters, just like stem cells.\n\n They can take on the makeup of whoever the body wants them to to make up.\n\n Clay is the only substance we eat that does that besides bone marrow, clay and bone marrow.\n\n \r\nBut the clay is not really digestible.\n\n It helps you digest.\n\n It helps bring soil bacteria in, but it draws out poisons galore.\n\n So, it adds nutrients to your blood, your lymph, your neurological fluids to help you pull out these toxins out of the body.\n\n So, you take like a tablespoon of that soft liquid clay, and then you put it into 2 - 4 ounces of milk.\n\n\r\nYou can blend it or stir it.\n\n Tastes a little like chocolate milk if you're using terramin clay, and you drink that, and if you don't like the gritty taste in your mouth, you can follow it with a swallow of milk and flush it in your mouth, so you don't have all that grittiness in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI tried put some in some milk to and it wouldn't dissolve, just stirring it with a spoon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're taking it dry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, no?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt was wet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMoist?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMoist.\n\n You need to blend it.\n\n You need to mix it around because if it gets into the blood, you want a lot of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium with it to bind with the poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut can you like just maybe swallow your milk real fast.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you can't mix it here, what makes you think it's gonna mix it in the stomach?\n\n \r\nYou need to disperse it?\n\n The reason I don't like it is a lot of people in autopsies and people who use clay, I've seen clay impactations.\n\n\r\nPlaces where it dried up intestines and just stayed there.\n\n That meant that whole area of intestine didn't function.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you don't recommend using clay regularly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n But I'm saying you blend with milk.\n\n Mix it in a fluid so it thins it so it doesn't clump.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\n Does it matter if the milk is cold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOf course?\n\n Gotta be room temperature.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Weight Gain Is 2.5 Year Cycle, When Aajonus Started Eating Raw , 500 Eggs A Day, 1 Pound Of Meat A Day, What Eggs The Woman Ate \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEarlier with the gaining weight, losing weight, and I could be on the same amount of food on the diet and when I was very sick, I lost rapid weight, like three pounds\n\n And then when I started to feel better, I gained the weight back without really trying.\n\n Does your body just find its own balance.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n That's what it wants to do.\n\n I prefer you do it on its own, but in the recipe book, I set a six month period because a lot of people are afraid that if they gain the weight, they're never going to lose it.\n\n It's usually a two and a half year cycle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey gain the weight back.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n Most of the time people will gain the weight, keep it for two and a half years, then their body will go through a detoxification, knock it off, and then grow it back.\n\n And you know, I stopped putting it on heavily again.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYeah, but you've been on it 40 years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, I've been on raw meat on a daily basis since December of 82.\n\n So, that's when I count that I went on a good diet when I started eating meat twice daily on a daily basis.\n\n Before that, I was just eating meat three days a week, one meal.\n\n So, three pounds of meat a week maximum.\n\n Now I eat a pound a day.\n\n\r\nAnd if I don't eat pound of meat a day, I eat 50 eggs.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd you don't work out at all.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're serious with eating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI up 50 eggs?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nNot a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I've eaten up 50 eggs a day.\n\n Done it many times.\n\n Let's say a hundred times.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nThat for protein and mineralization.\n\n Is that why you eat so many eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because eggs are already liquid, so there's very little digestion involved?\n\n So, if I want to get strong and healthy fast, I'll eat a lot of eggs and eat bone marrow along with it.\n\n I may have three sections of bone marrow in a day because eggs don't have the ability to increase cellular division like meat will.\n\n\r\nRrefrigerated milk is the same way, so I eat the bone marrow with it, so that I will regenerate cells fast as well as strengthen your body.\n\n \r\nLike the example I used in the Recipe Book, the woman with emphysema who was supposed to die that weekend.\n\n She had 33 eggs on Saturday, 33 on Sunday.\n\n She was out of the bed and off the machines on Monday morning.\n\n\r\nOnly eggs could ever do that, so I know the value of eggs.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAnd they weren't organic though, huh.\n\n You didn't mention that, they were regular eggs?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey were regular eggs?\n\n I told her doctor to get them at least at a health food store and I said, ones that are cage free not the organic in a cage.\n\nSo, that's what you got.\n\n They weren't the best eggs I'm sure.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Where Terramin Clay Comes From \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, it's not consistent\n\n When I feel my body starting to detox and I get very nauseous and I don't want to go through days of vomiting, I'll have three tablespoons daily, sometimes four.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd do you use the terramin clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlways?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhere does the clay come from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's near the Mojave Desert?\n\n It was an old aqua bed, a hot mineral spring, and they mine it where it's only come out of the ground no more than 98°.\n\n So, all the phosphorous is intact, everything's intact.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCould you put it on a stye, or a boil or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n \r\nBut put it on wet.\n\n Don't put it on dry.\n\n Put it in the store though.\n\n Go to terramin.\n\ncom.\n\n**[not active site]**\n\r\nIt's probably probably eight miles away.\n\n They're in the desert off away.\n\n Cuz terramin clay is such a good clay.\n\n It's the best one I've ever experimented with and tried.\n\n People are going to terramin more and more and more, and all these other companies are losing, so they're coming up with stories.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs clay something that would be beneficial for anyone to be using.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAs long as you grew up on the sad diet, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can raise your hand on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnybody here not raise on the sad diet .\n\n *laughs* \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (32) Wifi Is Bad \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about wireless systems\n\n You have wireless net access?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, very bad.\n\n Definitely.\n\n When I use it and I'll go to a hotel and that's all I have, my laptop's here and I'm over here.\n\n I have good vision, longsight vision, so I can read that far, but I've got it three feet from me.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nAre we talking about routers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Routers the same thing.\n\n Routers, wifi, wireless.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

genetically modified GMO corn.\n\n So, the tests that are coming out now in the scientific reports on GMO products is terrifying, very terrifying.\n\n \r\nThey'll kill animals in very short period of time, give them all kinds of disease and deformities.\n\n\r\nI'm not eating chicken and I'm not eating eggs right now.\n\n Fish and beef.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Ages, Pyruvate, No Carbs For 6 Hours \n \n**[2009],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, no, usually that's from high advanced glycation end products and glucose made from carbohydrate\n\n Very sticky.\n\n \r\nIf your body uses a protein to make the pyruvate to make glycogen, there's very little advanced glycation end product and no stickiness.\n\n \r\nSo, the mind stays very alert and very active.\n\n\r\nAnd you don't eat any fruit until six hours, at least six hours after you've been awake.\n\n You don't eat any carbohydrate, until you've been awake, I mean any concentrated carbohydrate, until you've been awake at least six hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd that will help reverse stickiness in the cells.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou won't have it, unless you overeat fruit?\n\n\r\nYour body, in the first six hours will make all the glycogen that will be used to feed the brain and the nervous system for the entire day that you're awaken up and even while you sleep.\n\n \r\nIf you go in the afternoon and you eat a tremendous amount of fruit with high carbs, the body's still gonna make a lot of glycogen with it and store it in your body, and it's gonna feed it once in a while to your system, and that's gonna make it sticky.\n\n\r\nEven though your body's mainly using non-sticky pyruvate made glycogen.\n\n Two non-stick gluco, glycogen, um, prove eight made glycogen.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Bacteria \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe FDA wants you sick because they work for the medical institution, the pharmaceuticals, and they work for the food industry\n\n They're gonna back everything that they want.\n\n \r\nThey want you to believe that bacteria's responsible for all disease, bacteria's not responsible for any disease.\n\n\r\nYour body is 99% bacteria.\n\n For every one gene that you have a human gene, you have 100 bacterial genes in your body.\n\n You're 1% human, you're 99% bacterial.\n\n\r\nAnd if you don't believe me, get online and go to TED and go for bacteria and there was a bacteriologist who talks about it.\n\n We're 90% - 99%.\n\n But microbiologists tell you, you are 90% - 99% bacteria.\n\n She believes 99% because there's 100 - 1 genes.\n\n She says, I tell people they're 1% human.\n\n So, she's one of those microbiologists that believe that 99% bacterial, and I go along with it, we are 99%.\n\n\r\nWhy should we be afraid of bacteria.\n\n It's the dumbest thing in the world, and yet people buy it all the time?\n\n That's the whole article in my next newsletter that will come out this week, and it talks about that.\n\n It talks about all of the chemicals they are putting in antibiotic soaps.\n\n\r\nThere are two main chemicals that are hormone disruptors and I've listed all the products and it is a incredible list from toothpaste all the way down to shampoos, deodorants.\n\n You name it, it's in it.\n\n And then I go into a section where your household, and it's in a slew of those.\n\n\r\nThese are hormone disruptors that prevent fertility, that prevent proper sperm counts and sperm resilience.\n\n These are only two of the chemicals that are studied.\n\n\r\nAll of these chemicals create disease, not bacteria.\n\n If bacteria were the cause of disease, I would be dead a thousand times, and it isn't true.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Can U Trust Northstar Bison Non Vax At Rawsome \n \n**[2009],[Joe]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCan we still trust the bison from Rawsome that they're not vaccinated\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, Mary Gracie who owns North Star Bison, we get the buffalo from, assures us that we never get a vaccinated female or a dewormed one?\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nSo, that would be our best source of beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nJust I would suggest that you never eat any of the bison that's from the neck up because when they deworm them, they put the right along the spinal cord, which creates CJD.\n\n That's, Mad Cow Disease, disintegrates the spinal cord and brain.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nWell, normal beef wouldn't be from the neck up.\n\n Pardon the normal?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n Correct.\n\n**[Joe]**\n\r\nAnd as long as you get brain or something like that, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI wouldn't get a brain?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Cancer Riagnose Rate In The Past, Blood Works Are Bullshit \n \n**[2009],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, basically one of the things that I'm kind of interested in nowis prostate cancer is a disease that's widespread\n\n A lot of people are getting diagnosed with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDiagnosed, but not true.\n\n PSA has nothing to do with prostate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I'll say you have a biopsy and it shows that there's a sort of cancer cells and blah, blah.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLet me straighten that out.\n\n 60 years ago, do you know what the analysis for treatable cancer was.\n\n 500 cancer cells per million?\n\n Do you know what it is now.\n\n 50 cancer per cells per million?\n\n\r\nWhy did they do that.\n\n More money When they analyze somebody for cancer- everybody's got cancer cells in their body?\n\n What ratio is treatable.\n\n What ratio is causing a difficulty or a problem?\n\n None?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, that's interesting, but that wasn't the question, but the issue that's interesting to me is that there are approaches that are like this.\n\n\r\nThere is a number of like legume based diets and all kinds of diets and medical diet.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n But it's weird cause it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to understand all the false statistics out there.\n\n About 80% of all the cancers that are diagnosed as treatable and a problem are not.\n\n\r\n85% of the diabetics that come to me that are taking insulin are not even diabetic.\n\n You have to understand that a blood test is a snapshot.\n\n If I take a olaroid of you, that's like me judging your entire life from a Polaroid, the most absurd thing in the world.\n\n Everybody is different.\n\n Chemistry is gonna be different every 20 minutes, 20 - 30 minutes.\n\n\r\nSo, if I really wanna understand maybe how your body is working, not how it may change, but how it changes on a daily basis.\n\n I'd have to do your blood work every 30 minutes every day for about a year and a half before I'd have an idea of how your body works and in what pattern.\n\n\r\nEven seasonal, it's different.\n\n \r\nSo, when a doctor takes a test and shows you from either one or two tests because you've had a glucose issue and they're feeding you corn syrup, garbage for this test.\n\n Of course you're going to be way off imbalance.\n\n You're gonna have very high sugar levels and they tell you you're diabetic, there's no cure for it and take this insulin.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Century Eggs \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Chinese keep eggs for 25 years, called the century egg and they sell them\n\n It's completely pre digested.\n\n The bacteria, their waste is our food.\n\n\r\nSo, there's nothing but waste left after 25 years.\n\n\r\nThat's why oxygenarians in China will pay $1000 dollars for one of those eggs.\n\n They can have sex, it's like Viagra, high for 28 - 30 days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOne egg is gonna be like Viagra.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n \r\nIt's 25 year old.\n\n It's either completely white inside or completely black inside, and it's all powder.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou know, with the commercial nature of our society, I can't imagine someone hasn't went with a 25 year old egg.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNobody's gonna pay $1000 for an egg except the Chinese man?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf you got somebody who's 80 years old and all of a sudden he's got sexual prowess at that age, you know.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey aren't appetizing either for the regular pallet?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Chemicals In Food, Butcher Chemicals \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey put MSG in, the FDA approved five or six viruses to spray on meats to destroy bacteria, that was just done two years ago, or a year and a half ago\n\n And they allow you to put ammonia, Clorox on any counter and not clean it off completely, so your meats get cut on that.\n\n\r\nPut ammonia in the meat too.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow are people not aware of that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMost people are asleep about all that because your media doesn't cover it?\n\n The only way you're gonna know is research it yourself.\n\n \r\nAnd the FDA is owned by those pharmaceutical and the food industry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo when you buy fish from the fish market, I always smell the chlorine.\n\n\r\nWhat do you do.\n\n Do you wash the fish?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n What I tell them to do, I say get out a fresh cut.\n\n I want you to wash that board off completely, only with water.\n\n And I want to see you slice it with a clean water, clean knife only, and dry.\n\n I make them cut it all myself.\n\n I make them cut it right in front of me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, you mean a fresh fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's right?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Chrohns = Leaky Gut = Undigested Food Particles To Joints (knees), Raw Eggs \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause the intestines, when you have Crohn's, usually the physiological process of that is that you stop making proper mucus to line the intestines, your own digestive acids, start eating away your intestinal lining, so it becomes thinner and thinner\n\n\r\nSo what happens is the gut gets so thin that it will often cause tearing if you eat too much, and that's called leaky gut.\n\n When undigested food particles pass into your gut out of the intestines, and they usually travel to the knees first.\n\n Not always, but probably 80% of the time.\n\n \r\nSo, people start having knee problems, knee aches, knee swelling.\n\n Because the body sends the particles down to the knee and the knee forms acids just to become a digestive tract to break it down.\n\n That causes 80% of all arthritis and rheumatism is leaky gut.\n\n The knees and joints weren't supposed to be made to be a digestive organ.\n\n\r\nSo, eating the eggs allows the intestines to work very little and yet they get all these nutrients to nutrify and when you have the egg white and the egg yolk together, it builds a good mucus.\n\n So, all of a sudden within like 24 - 36 hours in a case of Crohn's disease can be in the process of reversal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI have a relative who has had Crohn's for many years.\n\n It seems to have evolved into chronic fatigue syndrome,.\n\n Would it be the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor someone like this who isn't used to raw eggs, how do you consume them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAlways buy themselves?\n\n Otherwise you mix 'em with milk, it's gonna take 6 - 10 hours to digest them, and it's complicated.\n\n\r\nSo, they have to be just downed rocky style or the way I do is sucked right out of an eggshell.\n\n Did she see Rocky.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe breaks the five eggs in and then you gotta go like this.\n\n It doesn't work if you don't go like this *laughs*.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if you mix it with milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt slows it down?\n\n It takes 6 - 10 hours to digest raw milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould you still get benefit though over time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt won't be the tume?\n\n It's gonna take you much longer, sometimes 5 - 20 times longer.\n\n Eggs are so pure and absorb so fast, there's no difficulty.\n\n\r\nLet's say the milk finds a spot where you've already torn and you've got an ulceration there that's not healing, and it tears every time and you have leaky gut in that spot every time when it reaches that area, that area's not gonna be able to heal because you're gonna have digestive juices and acids and bacteria working on the food in that spot.\n\n\r\nIf you have the egg, the egg's already absorbed within 5 inches of the intestine.\n\n So, the intestines don't have to work anywhere for digesting except for that first 5 inches.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, let's say for instance, when they had colon cancer, the colon had been removed and they had a ileostomy bag.\n\n\r\nThe best route for your nutritious revitalization would be just raw eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's it?\n\n Raw eggs and milk.\n\n Your colon is where your last stage of digestion happens and the e coli mainly are responsible for breaking the fats and proteins down to the finite molecule to feed your brain a nervous system.\n\n\r\nPeople who have psychological problems like depression, anxiety is different.\n\n Anxiety is not exercising.\n\n Depression is always a lack of bacteria.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Feeding Sprouts To Chicken \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nSprouts for the chickens\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you can't feed just sprouts to a chicken, that'll kill the chicken.\n\n If you feed only sprouts to a bird, it will kill a bird in about 12 days.\n\n There are three enzymes that act like phytic acid.\n\n In any kind of grain or nut, you have phytic acid, which prevents mineral absorption, which prevents protein absorption, which prevents fat absorption.\n\n So, it's a whole chain reaction, so they sprout or germinate grains to alter that phytic acid.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, when you alter that, you've got three other enzymes that are produced in vegetation state, which do exactly the same thing as phytic acid, so here you have three times the amount of that ingredient.\n\n \r\n\r\nHowever, if you germinate in milk, the lactic acids in the milk destroy those enzymes.\n\n Of course, the sprout will never mature into an adult plant, but it breaks it down so the chickens can eat it with no problem, and the pigs can eat it.\n\n Any animal can eat it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou cause it to be sprouted in the milk.\n\n You take dry grain and you put it in milk.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, with that being said, right now you don't want chicken and eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm not eating any chicken right now?\n\n I'm just sticking with beef and fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you think every egg has mercury or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, it's certain ones?\n\n \r\n\r\nThey're using mercury to feed the chickens for laying eggs as an antibiotic.\n\n And in adult chickens for meat, they're using arsenic instead of antibiotic.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI don't know how much soy is in it.\n\n We have photographs of the feed packages, but there's been so much going on, I haven't been able to go to the store and see, but anyway, I will, cause I know that we've got a photograph of the feed they were given, so I have to investigate that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nBut with the mercury and the arsenic alone, that pulled a lot of our nutrients out of the system.\n\n Now in my eyes, I had a great deal of changes from the injections.\n\n I had all this metal accumulated my intestinal tract in iridology.\n\n So, you could see the patterns all throughout the intestinal tract with the additional metal.\n\n And after eating all of these eggs, there's no way I can tell arsenic except as a green radiant compound in the iris.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd obviously I didn't absorb a lot of that, but the mercury is coming out and when I had the hair analysis done here and the hair analysis on my head after the injections, all of those were high, so I can't tell on me.\n\n I can't tell how much is those injections and how much are the eggs.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I have to look at my patients who had no other exposure, like that little girl.\n\n All of a sudden, her arsenic and they just started feeding her all Rawsome Foods.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nFor how long was she on the diet, the little girl.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe father didn't tell me he you said it, but I don't remember?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd is she better now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, she had severe lead poisoning, almost died from the school that she went to?\n\n Then they had put her own special diet to make sure it's as pure as possible so her body could clean out the lead.\n\n They always kept tabs on her, always checked her blood to see what the levels were and then the arsenic, lead and Mercury started elevating considerably.\n\n And the only thing she had exposure she had was Rawsome food.\n\n So, he checked the eggs and the beef first, cuz of course, be the highest in mercury, not the fruits and not the dairy.\n\n So, sure enough, that's where he found it.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd the eggs and the chicken.\n\n**[They were talking about Rawsome was selling bad eggs and labeled as high-quality organic],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nIs there chicken we can still eat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRocky Jr?\n\n There's still 25% - 30% soy, but you know, the rest is corn.\n\n A lot of its genetically modified, GMO corn.\n\n So, the tests that are coming out now in the scientific reports on GMO products is terrifying, very terrifying.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey're killing animals in very short period of time, gives them all kinds of disease and deformities.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI'm not eating chicken and I'm not eating eggs right now.\n\n Fish and beef.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (10) Fluoride \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, you have to look\n\n Like I said in my newsletter this week, I said they are afraid of another revolution.\n\n 1776 happened because people were healthy: eating off the farm, not eating chemicals in their food, not getting fluoride in their water.\n\n \r\nFluoride causes docility in animals to the point where if you put it in their water, they will be killed by their peers.\n\n They won't fight back.\n\n \r\nHitler used it to make his prisoners in the concentration camps docile.\n\n Why do you think you're trying to get it in everybody's water.\n\n \r\nSan Diego has fought it off for 11 years now?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Frozen Butter, Breakout From Milk \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLike rashes on his face or diaper kinda rash\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIs he drinking it cold or warm.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWarming it up?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou always warm i.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nUsually we like put under like hot water and warm it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhen did you start feeding him the raw.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nProbably about 17 months?\n\n 11, 12 months we started feeding him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n So, 11 or 12 months you started feeding him.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, what did you feed him when he was feeding prior.\n\n Regular formula?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nJust organic milk or formula to start, get off that and then go to organic milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, pasteurized homogenized.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nPretty much, yeah?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo, he's got old lactate, toxic lactate and cauterized lactate and  probably cauterized casein and that'll cause rashes.\n\n \r\nNow we're supposed to discard 90% of our toxins through the skin.\n\n So, if it goes out through the bowels, it causes diarrhea.\n\n If it comes up vomit of quartz coming out the stomach, that's not a good place for it to go because the damages bacteria and the damages the environment in the intestine.\n\n\r\n80% - 90% of digestion is supposed to be bacterial.\n\n Only 10% - 20% is enzymatic, digestive juices and those digestive juices, like the hydrochloric acid, which is our main one, is to break down larger particles of food into smaller particles of food for the bacteria to infiltrate those molecules and eat them.\n\n\r\nTheir waste is our food.\n\n So, we basically live on a diet of shit and piss from bacteria .\n\n Now, when you think about that, you look at the medical profession and you say, what is all this bacteria phobia.\n\n What is all that about?\n\n It's all about hiding the real culprits of disease, which is industrial pollution?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you have an opinion on colostrum.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nColostrum is the first 3 - 5 days after a calf is born?\n\n The mother, the cow produces a mainly buttery milk.\n\n Cream is very difficult to the digest, so if you gave a calf that was only 1 - 5 days old, that calf would have constant diarrhea if you fed them whole milk with the cream.\n\n So the cow mother makes a butter milk basically.\n\n So, that's why colostrum is so yellow.\n\n The cream is already broken down into a buttery substance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI looked through your book, I didn't really see that mentioned.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt wasn't something that people could get, now they can get it?\n\n When I wrote my book, it wasn't available.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you think.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's wonderful?\n\n I will buy it every time I get a chance, I will drink it every time I get a chance.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIf someone doesn't have access to raw butter for the moisturizing/lubrication formula.\n\n If they had pasteurized butter, does that that hold any nutritional value.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt might be better than processed vegetable oils, but it certainly is not the equivalent of raw unsalted butter?\n\n\r\nEven freezing butter is a problem and Sally Fallon and all those say, oh, freeze this, freeze that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Frozen Meat and Frozen Butter \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nA group of animals and divided them into two\n\n I gave them frozen meat, the same carcass, the same animal, the same side of beef, and I gave half of them unfrozen, the other frozen.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAll the ones that had the frozen meat all got a skin disorder within six weeks.\n\n One of 'em had it so bad it looked like he had the mange, and this was both cats and dogs.\n\n \r\n\r\nEvery one of 'em had a skin disorder.\n\n Those that ate the unfrozen, same mea, unfrozen; calm relaxed, no itching, happy, not a problem.\n\n And that's it.\n\n I didn't even feed them water in that time.\n\n All they got for that whole time was just the meat.\n\n The ones that got the frozen meat dehydrated; they had all these skin problems.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then I decided, well, I can test the butter now.\n\n So, the ones with all the ill conditions, skin conditions.\n\n I knew the butter would reverse that, raw butter would reverse any kind of skin condition because it would get in there and handle the poisons that were passing through the skin and protect the cells that were there, not get dried out.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I took the same batch of butter and I froze half of it and didn't freeze the other half, and just refrigerated one.\n\n Now before I served it to them, of course I would always let that out for about 12 hours to get room temperature cuz dogs and cats don't like cold things.\n\n They just don't like it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I put it out for them, they ate it and the ones who got the unfrozen butter healed five times quicker than the ones that got the frozen butter.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, the frozen butter is five times less potent than non-frozen butter.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo happy medium, wouldn't you say get the colostrum if you can't get the raw butte.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRaw colostrum would be very helpful, yes?\n\n \r\n\r\nOr you can just get the cream and make your own butter, I tell you how to do that in the recipe book.\n\n Make your own butter, it's easy the way I suggested in the book.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen you can make it that simply, it isn't easy.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (13) Glycerin \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGlycerin is a chemical compound, it isn't natural when they finish making glycerin\n\n It may have come from cellulose, but by the time they chemically treat it and produce it, it's no longer anything but a chemical, a gelatinized chemical.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long did the gal use the butter and the pineapple to get her vision better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA couple years?\n\n Well, she used mainly butter, but once in a while she used pineapple.\n\n She went from about 3/8ths of an inch thick glasses to 1/8th of an inch thick in 1.\n\n5 years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nEvery day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nShe did it every day?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHave you ever tried it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm too lazy?\n\n \r\nI've got so many other things to do, I'm lazy for that.\n\n Like a more thing on the list, right.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're not saying to put that in your eye right after surgery, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you can put the egg white in your eye after surgery and use the aloe vera right after surgery?\n\n But the butter, I would wait a day, 24, 36 hours.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) High Meat Required For Ecoli For Mental Illness \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, if they don't have a colon, they're not gonna be breaking their food down into the finite molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system\n\n So, they need rotten eggs or rotten meat to supply it.\n\n Like in my episode of Ripley's Believe It or Not, I had two patients there.\n\n One had been on psychotropic drugs for 27 years.\n\n\r\n7 different kinds a day she took and about I think somewhere around 30 of those pills daily, 30 of the 7 daily.\n\n\r\nAnd she was a basket case.\n\n So, finally I got her to eat- the conversation went like this.\n\n I said, \"Well, you can't stay on the diet cuz you're mostly distraught.\n\n You're not feeding your brain and nervous system even though you're on this diet, cuz you're not digesting the finite proteins and fats.\n\n So, you gotta eat the high meat\".\n\n \r\n\"I'm already on this diet that's antisocial!\", Bam.\n\n Hung up on me.\n\n \r\nSo, a few hours later, \"Okay, how do I make this high meat.\n\n\"?\n\n I said, \"It's in the book, but what you can do is just you cut up the meat and you put it  meat space and half air space in it, and you open it every few days out of the refrigerator, 2 - 3 days to air it out, to get the aerobic bacteria going well, as well as the anaerobic bacteria.\n\n So, you have all breeds and it'll take about four-\".\n\n \r\n\"I don't have 14 days!\" \r\nI said, \"Okay, well I have another patient who makes a lot of it, eats it every day, cuz he had the same problem as you, and he'll eats a high meat every day and he has.\n\n Maybe he'll sell you some\".\n\n \r\nSo I called him, gave him her number.\n\n He called her.\n\n So I got a call.\n\n She called me like 2:00 PM the first time, this is like 9:00 PM.\n\n \"Okay.\n\n I got the high meat from James, another James, not James Stewart.\n\n I ate some of it, awful smelling and it's bad tasting and I'm thinking I'm gonna have a real problem\".\n\n\r\nSo, I let the answering machine, I just listened like, okay, cuz I knew I'd babysit her all night.\n\n So, every 45 minutes to an hour she called and every 45 minutes to an hour, she got a little bit better, by 5:00 AM, I'm gonna stay on this phone until you answer.\n\n\r\nAnd then she started whistling.\n\n I said, now's the time to answer.\n\n So I said, \"Look at your mood.\n\n When's the last time you whistled in your life.\n\n When's the last time you played like that in your life\"?\n\n \"Oh, that's right\"?\n\n I said, Now you got through the whole night on your own.\n\n You don't need me.\n\n You're strong.\n\n You got through the whole night on your own, and you ain't this putrid, nasty stuff that the FDA thinks says is gonna kill you, and look what it's done.\n\n Make you happy?\n\n It made you happy in 10 - 20 minutes compared to what you were before.\n\n And here now we're what, 7 hours, 8 hours, beyond when you ate it and you are a different person\".\n\n\r\nSo, she went on Ripley's Believe It or Not, after eating a year like that, rotten, stinky high meat and ate it right there on Ripley's with another patient and I.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) How Long High Meat \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow long\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've kept it up to a year and three months?\n\n You haven't seen Ripley's Believe It or Not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I have not?\n\n I missed that one.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI had it up to a year and three months.\n\n I had glands.\n\n\r\nI had jars all along my porch, remember on that shot went by and I had everything.\n\n I had glands, I had organs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWas it refrigerated.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo?\n\n I wanted it to decay and rot, but that's a whole nother subject.\n\n \r\nIt's all predigested.\n\n It's completely, it's like your bacteria does inside your body.\n\n\r\nIt's just like kefir and yogurt.\n\n You're letting the bacteria break it down before you eat it, so it's very easily absorbable.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI understand that, but in terms of baby steps.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nBaby steps towards the dive, how long, like in an refrigerator could stay, like almost indefinitely.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI've never let it go more than year and three months, so I can't tell you indefinitely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut when it gets slimy and it smelly.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the best part?\n\n If you cut your gut, that's how it would smell in your gut.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Injections, Aajonus Not Digesting Well From Liver Damage \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, as you can see, I've aged a lot in the last 1\n\n5 years for those who remember, cuz of those injections.\n\n \r\nHere are the scars of the injections, There's the holes like these, came out like I got shot by bullets.\n\n\r\nI got two big ones here.\n\n\r\nI lost probably about 3 inches of arm that I never had to work out to have.\n\n And now you can see that I've lost a lot of that muscle from this.\n\n When it first happened, this went down almost 3.\n\n5 inches.\n\n \r\nI got the real skinny arm and a lot of the weight all around here trimmed off.\n\n So, I'm much smaller now and I'm never one to work out, so I'm building up slowly.\n\n But I was much thinner, I was about probably 15 pounds lighter than I am right now.\n\n That process, and you can see again this side too, all that muscle that's gone in the skin, but it was worse, 6 -7 months ago.\n\n  It was 4 times this cause I'm building the muscle back again and the skin is not as relaxed as it was.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much are you eating.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I've got a problem?\n\n If I eat too much, I'll get diarrhea and it's not from anything in particular.\n\n \r\nWhen I want to eat the things that I want to eat, like lots of butter, I don't digest it as well because there must be some liver damage from all of those injections.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou look skinny, you never look skinny.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n This is a small shirt and I used to wear mediums, now they're huge.\n\n\r\nBut, I'll put it back on.\n\n I've already put on about 12 pounds of it already.\n\n It's just a slow process and I feel it's getting near the end, almost all of it.\n\n The worst of it's over.\n\n So, I'm starting to gain more.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) James Supplyinh Arsenic&mercury Eggs \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nBut then there was a problem with James supplying eggs that had mercury in it and chickens that had arsenic in it because he was giving us eggs that were grown off commercial feed in commercial chickens\n\n And the farmer, Sharon Palmer, actually went out and bought commercial chickens and commercial eggs and sold them to James, Rawsome Club as organic, no soy or anything in them and it was absolutely just commercial junk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow'd you find that out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, I kept having problem with the change?\n\n One time there was heavily salt in it and another time the chicken was just really, really foul and not bad.\n\n Like very low-grade feed.\n\n So, it's an inconsistency and I know that doesn't happen on an organic farm.\n\n There's no inconsistency in quality and the eggs were almost always uniformly sized and always chemically cleaned, washed.\n\n And our contract on the membership and with the farmer is that they have to be organic, no soy, and that the eggs are not to be washed.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey may be wiped with a wet cloth, damp and only water, and that's it.\n\n So, none of this was like that and James kept, every time I told James, James just said, \"Oh, you know what you're talking about.\n\n This is perfectly good\".\n\n Well, you have to understand he owns part of the.\n\n And he made $10,000 a month from it, and Sharon took another $10,000.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they were making a lot of money on taking this commercial stuff and selling it for a very high price and then we were the consumers.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I got fed up with it and in June, right after the, I said, well, this is a good time to stir up everything cause some everything's already stirred up.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, I got a detective agency involved in it and had them watch the farm, interview certain old employees that they had and the evidence was outstanding.\n\n The employees were actually fired, they were disgruntled because they kept telling her, \"Wait a minute, you're selling this as organic at 12 farmer's markets and to Rawsome, and we know what you're buying.\n\n We know what you're doing.\n\n You have us cleaning the chickens and putting\", and we've got pictures, taking them out of the companies bagging and putting them into non-labeled bags and then giving them to us.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd then one another reason we found out about that I finally did something about it was that when we started investigating, it started coming up about this one person who had written the district attorney up in that area saying that my little girl had lead poisoning.\n\n She's in a very serious state, and so we check everything that goes into her and everything we bought was from Rawsome for this period, and her mercury and arsenic levels started hitting the roof.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, they had the eggs tested and the chicken tested.\n\n The chicken came up high in arsenic and the eggs came up high in mercury.\n\n So, we have that evidence too.\n\n So, it's, it's just outstanding and it's outrageous.\n\n James still denies it.\n\n He's in total denial about it and we just have to go through legal means to settle it cuz there's a lot of angry people.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI know that I've been working with people who are very, very chemically sensitive and when your chicken with arsenic in it and mercury, made it very difficult.\n\n It's only been that difficult in the past two years that we've been getting those eggs and that chicken.\n\n  \r\n\r\nEvery time I came to LA and would eat those eggs, and I eat a lot of eggs.\n\n I eat anywhere from, let's say 8 - 50 a day, and that's how much mercury I was consuming and because their commercial eggs are not good value.\n\n So, I was getting these big sores all over my neck every time two days after I got here in LA, every time.\n\n And I just thought, well, it's better food, every time that I'm here, I'm getting the best.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then when I found out from this report from the investigator, and then this one father with that little girl testing it, I realized what it was.\n\n So, I stopped eating the eggs and the chicken and all the breakout went away.\n\n Now I've returned to Los Angeles last Friday.\n\n I don't have that breakout, so it's a very, very bad thing that James Stewart did.\n\n Very bad thing.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd he was told also, the ex-employees told him what she was doing.\n\n So he was told many times, and we have all this testimony in writing, signed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm kind of unfamiliar with this whole case and like you're getting the raw eggs.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNot anymore.\n\n I tell everybody not to buy it.\n\n He's still carrying her eggs.\n\n  \r\n\r\nI'm talking about Rawsome up in Venice.\n\n \r\n\r\nMothers.\n\n I don't trust any eggs from the store.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nReally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, because they only grow them in big houses?\n\n Maybe they're not small cages.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (18) James Trying To Ban People, Aajonus Freaked Everybody Out At Rawsome \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nI got banned\n\n I'm not allowed to go to Rawsome.\n\n \r\n\r\nJames wasn't part owner of the lot; I could say and I did.\n\n I wrote him a notice.\n\n I said, \"You have no authority cuz I'm the one who runs Rawsome clubs and all the other clubs under the right to choose healthy food.\n\n If you read the contract, I'm in.\n\n You cannot ban me right from the members club.\n\n I am the main member\".\n\n I said, \"But it is your lot and you own it, and you can ban me from the lot\", but he tried to ban all the members who were involved in helping me get all the evidence.\n\n What does that tell you.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHe's guilty?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n So, I told him he cannot ban these people.\n\n If he wants to restrict them from going to the property and he can't revoke their membership because he's not in charge of the membership, I am.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, he has to deliver the food for them to pick up somewhere.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nReally.\n\n Wow?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, I told him that.\n\n Yeah.\n\n We'll see how he honors it, but I sent it to his attorney too.\n\n This guy is way out the line, way out the line.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOkay.\n\n You have a question.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nUS wellness meats?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nGreat?\n\n John's very good.\n\n Took me two years to get him to go to good quality and not freeze it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you still buy the cheese and everything else from Rawsome.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI get everything from Rawsome but the chicken and the eggs?\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I went there last Wednesday and just freaked everybody out.\n\n I walked in, James shot out, just walked out.\n\n So, then I got, you know, the letter from his attorney.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nActed really strange the other day when he delivered to use.\n\n Just as quiet as as can be, he's not normally like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, he doesn't want anybody attacking him about that.\n\n He was expecting people to talk about the issue.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nIt was really funny.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHe was apprehensive what he was gonna tell people.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nCan anybody start another club.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWe already have one already almost?\n\n They bought the refrigerators, we're just trying to line up the farmers to ship stuff, and that one should be opened in two weeks, and then that will be in Tujunga.\n\n And then there's another one that should open up in Echo Park within a month and a half.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the name.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nRa Healthy Foods?\n\n RA, like the sun God Ra.\n\n Ra Healthy Foods.\n\n \r\n\r\nThere there'll be a website.\n\n Should be up in a week.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nHow far is Tujunga.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nTujunga is in the valley?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nThat's worse for us then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, that's on the other side of Los Angeles.\n\n \r\n\r\nEcho Parks closer, just left of downtown.\n\n So, there'll be two that open up nd I really don't know that building and safety, I don't think they're going to give James a permit for any of those buildings on there cause he didn't do it ahead of time.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nHe'll get closed down.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nHe'll get closed down, so he's gotta move it somewhere else and that's what I told him?\n\n And the attorney told him it first, a land developer.\n\n Move it, get it into Santa Monica where we're not gonna be hassled.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey get it from Rawsome, once every two weeks, is it.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but once they close?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat you do is order what you need and come on the same truck, then somebody has to go up to get it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but I'm saying bypass that couldn't we have somewhere San Diego.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI know what I'm saying is the same truck?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nJust stop off here.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, not stop up here?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou'll have to go to LA; he won't come here.\n\n Even for Rawsome, they have to go downtown and pick up all that food.\n\n It doesn't get delivered to Rossum and Venice, they have to go downtown and at a certain distribution warehouse to unpack it, to unload it, and put it on their trucks, and then take it from downtown to here.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou'd have to do the same thing with a van or something.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou'll have to work it out through the through whoever's working it there.\n\n But John Reid will be running that one, and you just send him your order or fax it or whatever, and he won't have to do much work.\n\n He'll just have to meet them when it comes in.\n\n That way you won't have the higher markup.\n\n Meet them up in Los Angeles downtown.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou're gonna have to transfer onto a truck to bring it down here, and that's gonna cost you a bloody fortune.\n\n You're talking about food that has to stay refrigerated, has to be handled a certain way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThere's not enough demand, the demand is so small.\n\n  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #.\n\n] \r\n\r\nYeah?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n We're lucky if we get $1200.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI spend $300, $350 a week just for my own food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nJoe's half of that order.\n\n He orders, $400, $500, $600.\n\n  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #.\n\n] \r\n\r\nI know, but that's how things get started?\n\n Rawsome didn't start out that way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI mean, start off in a garage, just selling the raw milk.\n\n  \r\n\r\n[Attendee #.\n\n] \r\n\r\nExactly?\n\n \r\n\r\nMore people know about it.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (19) Lasic Eye Surgery, Egg Whites In Eyes, Thimersol In Eye Drops, Aloe Vera Juice \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, as long as you're on a good diet, I've had many people do laser surgery\n\n They heal three times faster than the average; they can go out in the sun in 10 days.\n\n Their eyes are completely healed in 10 days, so it's not a problem and they never use the antibiotics.\n\n I tell them not to tell the doctor they're not gonna use the antibiotics, accept the antibiotics, but do not put them in your eyes and do not take because that destroys the bacteria that can lead to chelating of the tissue.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou have to understand that about 90% of the people who have LASIK surgery have difficulty and that's because they're using antibiotics, eye doesn't heal properly, so I don't mind LASIK surgery.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's going to take a long time to readjust cuz what happens is your cornea warps, whether it flattens or extends, that depends whether you have nearsightedness or farsightedness.\n\n So, cornea is warping.\n\n To be on this diet long enough and put enough egg white in your eye every day, and sometimes a tiny bit of butter with a drop of pineapple juice in it to rework the cornea will take years.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, when laser surgery can go on that, and if you're on a good diet, you're gonna heal properly.\n\n The first people that I suggested it's a good idea, I don't see her any harm in it.\n\n Nikki Ing, a Chinese lady, she did it when she was about 37, and that was in 1994 and Lewis Canjimmy did it in about 1992.\n\n Maybe it was earlier than that, aybe he did it in 1989.\n\n It was 1989 and their eyes are still in great condition.\n\n Haven't had to wear glasses anymore in that whole time.\n\n No wearing glasses anymore, no wearing contacts.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nHow do you do the butter.\n\n I tried to put some in just a very thin film?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou have to get the butter liquid.\n\n So, it has to be warm enough either in your hand or in a jar that's submersed in a tiny bit of hot water.\n\n It has to get a completely wet.\n\n Then you just take a little piece of pineapple and you squeeze one drop into it, into like a teaspoon of butter, and you mix that around while it's warm, and then you just tap it onto your little finger bottom, you hold down your eyelid, your lower one, you look up and you rub it along the white of the eye, and then you just roll it around so it gets everywhere and you wait 2, 3 minutes till the cloud goes away and that nutrifies the eye.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd with the egg white, it only takes a minute to absorb the egg white protein.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nWhen I take my contacts out, I will just put in the egg white before bed.\n\n And then I noticed, I sleep through the night and my eyes are shut from the drying of the egg white.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIsn't contact solution toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYes, a lot of them contain thimerosal, which is liquid mercury?\n\n But they make it without it with glycerin.\n\n But there's nothing you can put on the eye, but aloe vera real aloe vera juice.\n\n So, you can put that in your eye and contact over that.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe butter, you can't do cause it would create a film.\n\n Egg whites you can't do cuz it creates a film.\n\n But what I tell people to do is just take some distilled water and put a few grains of sea salt in it.\n\n So, you have a saline water and it's pure, there's nothing else in it.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd if you're putting either aloe vera or egg white in your eye, or butter in your eye, you're coating it in and you're nurturing it.\n\n You don't need glycerin.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (20) Lube Formaula, Food Combinations and Digestion Timing \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen you have it in that formula, the bile that the liver produces is very easy to break that down, cuz the lemon helps predigest it partially\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnd you have all the proteins in the egg white, which helps digest the fat, the butter.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen you don't have that combination, you have to eat the butter with meat or something like that.\n\n \r\n\r\nHowever, digestion of meat takes 19 - 24 hours.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDigestion of milk is 6 -10 hours.\n\n  \r\n\r\nDigestion of a raw egg by itself is only 27 - 30 minutes.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (21) Northstar Bison Vaccinates \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBison's great\n\n But if you get it from Northstar Bison, you have to make sure you're not buying a female, cuz she vaccinates the female.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nGreat Range.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n I don't know Great range?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey're sold at Costco.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, *laughs*\r\nNo dewormers.\n\n See, that's what you have to find out?\n\n You have to find all the stuff because they usually deworm.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFish and beef.\n\n Any eggs, really any eggs except these Amish, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, unless you can find a farmer that's just doing wild stuff and not feeding them a feed, giving them a commercial feed and I don't know any that do that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey always put something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey won't produce eggs, but they have to.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Olive Oil \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou think you can use olive oil\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you can use olive oil, but it's still, you have to understand olive oil is a very acidic compound and when you eat, it will kind of like burn when it's that old, kind of like burns?\n\n Well, when it's soaked in the meat, burns even more.\n\n It's like cod liver oil, you know how potent and burns that is.\n\n\r\nIt was like that, but I didn't eat the olive oil?\n\n Except as it was on the meat and I took the meat and scraped off a bit of it, but I ate the meat.\n\n It had the peanut oil and it had the olive oil in it, but it didn't

\n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo, not with our milk quality here cuz they'd be getting organic pastures and Organic Pastures nearly freezes their milk to keep the coliform bacteria down cause our jerk, terminator governor vetoed that bill we worked so hard to get through\n\n\r\nBut with the new governor coming in, I'm right off to Sacramento again.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe milk you buy right now in bottles isn't good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not so good, it isn't the best?\n\n Schwarzenegger makes sure we didn't have the high quality we need.\n\n So I get our shipped from from Amish farmers every week.\n\n\r\nIt's expensive, just as expensive as Organic Pastures to have ours shipped in.\n\n But we have high quality.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you get it in glass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI buy it in the glass, so it's frightenly expensive?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf I buy it in a half gallon, I'm paying $12 something?\n\n If I buy it in the gallon glass, I pay $17 - $18 a gallon.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about Claravale.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nClaravale farms feeds regular old feed?\n\n He and his wife called me and said, \"Why are you bad mouthing our milk\".\n\n I said, \"I'm not badmouthing your milk?\n\n It's just that you feed yours\".\n\n \r\n\"Well, we're organic.\n\n\" \r\nI said, \"Send me the label to your feed.\n\n The last time I saw your feed label, it's a regular old, has soy in it\", processed soy in it.\n\n It has a lot of other processed substance.\n\n It has molasses and molasses is boiled sugar cane till the slop boils down to the bottom at 475° - 700°.\n\n\r\nI said, \"That's not raw, that's not an organic substance\".\n\n I said, \"You send me your label\".\n\n Never received it.\n\n \r\nThe Amish grow their own.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre there any Amish out here.\n\n Are there any Amish in California?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nThey're too

they.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's a lot in Kansas?\n\n Mennonites in Kansas, Utah, there's some in Arizona.\n\n  \r\nI was just in Sedona and there were some there.\n\n\r\nWell you got 'em in Ohio, I have a slew of them in Ohio.\n\n.\n\n They're all over the place.\n\n \r\nJust in the West coast, there's not a lot of rain here.\n\n They stay where there's good farming.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Pemmican \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThen you've got beef jerky, then you have no active enzymes in it\n\n So, it's not really digestible.\n\n \r\nThe Eskimos, when they would make their pemmican every year, pemmican is when they take meat, lay it out, dry it out, so it was really hard.\n\n Then they would pound it into a powder and then take whale or seal blubber or whatever fat they can get, get in the sun till it melted, put it with the powdered meat and then let it soak in and make hard blocks of it.\n\n And each one would make a 90 pound block every year to get them through the winter in case they didn't get a fish or an animal to eat.\n\n But if they didn't eat any of it or whatever, they didn't eat by spring, they buried it, wouldn't eat it cuz it's an inferior food.\n\n\r\nEven though it's not cooked, it's dehydrated.\n\n If I dehydrate you to death, how much work are you gonna do for me.\n\n You can't bring it back to life, so they just bury it?\n\n So, anything that's completely dried is a survival food, but it's not a vibrant health giving food.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Preserving Meat, Glands For Sex&energy \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nRight before 2000, a friend of mine hunted a deer, so I butchered it and cut up all the pieces and the glands and everything and I got 38 pounds of it and he got 40 pounds of it\n\n And we downed the glands right away, I was high for three days, and really, I didn't sleep.\n\n \r\n\r\nI was very tired.\n\n I had given a workshop on Saturday, had seen patients for two days in Nevada City and then just as I was about to leave, I had to go pick my girlfriend up at Nevada Airport, so I had a good drive.\n\n I was going to take a nap, so he shoots this deer, so nobody knows how to butcher the thing, so I had to butcher it.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, that took three hours to butcher the whole thing, to skin it and butcher the whole thing, get it all into cuts to be able to package it.\n\n So, I spent that whole three hours doing that.\n\n Took the glands, put them in a blender with milk and blend it all together and we all drank it all right there.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I think they had a little bit left and I took a cup of it and they kept a couple of cups of it and I went to pick up my girlfriend.\n\n I was not tired; I was wide awake.\n\n We had sex for five hours, the next day she was tired.\n\n I wasn't tired, so I gave her half a cup of the glands and I had another half and we basically didn't sleep for two days, and had lots of sex.\n\n And we went out and visited, there's a bunch of lakes and I thought they were fresh water lakes, Pyramid Lake.\n\n Where were at the Pyramid Lake and I'm expecting fresh water, I dive into the salt water, I almost died and this was winter too.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo anyway, I had him ship the meat for me back to Malibu, so I packed all the meat up.\n\n I dried it a little bit on either side for about three, four hours on either side.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSundried.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, in the house?\n\n There was no sun those days that I was doing it or else I would've just left that in the sun for maybe 20, 30 minutes on either side.\n\n And I cut it in slices about 1/2 inch thick, maybe 3/4 of an inch thick, and then I stuffed them in quart and half gallon jars.\n\n And first I put either peanut oil, at that time we could get a completely raw peanut oil, never heated over 104°, but it's so expensive to make.\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey had such a demand for it that they just go for the cheap stuff now, so they don't produce it anymore.\n\n But I put 3/4 - 1 cup of the oil in the bottom, and then stuffed the meat around and of course the oil would come up up and coat the meat and then I would put more in as I stuffed more of the meat in until it was not a lot of oil, but just so it covered the surface of all the meat and then up to the top about a half inch above the meat level.\n\n  \r\n\r\nUsually, you'd put a beeswax sealer on the top of that, and that's normally how you do it to keep any gases or any oxidation of it.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I just put the lids on it.\n\n I wanted to see what happened with just the oil, without beeswax.\n\n And I just opened the last one in December, last December, and it was 10 years old and it was perfectly good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou think you can use olive oil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, you can use olive oil, but it's still, you have to understand olive oil is a very acidic compound and when you eat it, it kind of like burns when it's that old?\n\n Well, when it's soaked in the meat it even burns more.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's like cod liver oil, you know how potent and burns that is.\n\n It was like that, but I didn't eat the olive oil, except as it was on the meat and I took the meat and scraped off a bit of it, but I ate the meat?\n\n It had the peanut oil and it had the olive oil in it, but it didn't stink.\n\n I mean, didn't stink badly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nDoes coconut oil work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nCoconut oil ferments, doesn't work the same?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd that was room

government\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI've been protecting them?\n\n I've had six already I saved from the FDA closing down already this year.\n\n So, they signed contracts with me, so I own their animals.\n\n It's all private owned.\n\n It's no longer commercial and I send letters to the HHS, Human Health Services in Washington DC, the FDA in Washington, DC, then their local one.\n\n And I tell 'em, there's, you have no jurisdiction over here.\n\n If you trespass onto the property anymore, if you touch a gate to enter it when we told you not to, it's breaking and entering and we will prosecute.\n\n And if you come on with a false warrant and arrest anybody.\n\n I don't care if it's for 10 minutes, you kidnapped.\n\n Kidnapping, we don't use this false arrest crap that lets law enforcement off of the hook because what it is is kidnapping.\n\n If I arrest you for 10 minutes, it's kidnapping.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd the law enforcement agents that guns with them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nArmed assault and that's where we're getting in them before up here, when they came to us in Rawsome?\n\n  \r\n\r\nI don't care what the government does, the government has no say over anything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat the repercussions to that would be if there's no more board for licensing or certifying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey don't want it because Bush owns through a trust, Bush and the Bass family out of Texas own Whole Foods.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhy do you think it's all marketing.\n\n Go, go, go organic and then you only carry 2% organic produce at any time?\n\n That's nothing, it's all bullshit.\n\n Its all more government minded spin, and they don't produce anything better.\n\n And they just signed, what was it, five months ago.\n\n Two vegetarians to run Whole Foods?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat kind of mentality is that.\n\n Right away, those two guys got rid of raw milk and they said it was an insurance issue?\n\n Bullshit.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, do you think this is related to your place in Thailand, your retreat center.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're after me everywhere?\n\n They're not gonna stop and I'm not gonna stop.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen I got back from Thailand, from the east, after getting all those injections, I did three more radio shows on the swine flu.\n\n They're just not gonna stop me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI'm saying, how are they stopping you and you're in another fricking country.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're trying to take my land away that I was gonna make us as a spa.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nBut who is the culprit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't know who the fuck they are?\n\n They have the money in power.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nI mean, they're following you around or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're searching for me everywhere?\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's part of what I am, I've been homeless before.\n\n I lived on the old Earl Flynn estate on a hammock for three days one time I was homeless in Hollywood, so I'd been there before.\n\n I lived on a bicycle for three years out in the wild, I slept in graveyards, so I wouldn't be hassled.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm not afraid of anything.\n\n I'm not afraid of living outdoors.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, I'm saying to reach out to other people that, I mean, you can never seem to get a clinic together or some kind of retreat center to help people without just.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd some of the people who do become bankrupt right after they've offered me, so people who offer me now, I say, don't tell me, build it.\n\n We'll work through another channel, we'll have phone calls that are, are clandestine, but don't tell me.\n\n If you want to invest in that, you go build it, build it up like a regular clinic is but green without all the pollution, without all the asbestos and linoleum and all that stuff and no pressed board anywhere.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou build that, I will help it go, but you cannot be directly connected with me because you'll become bankrupt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nIs that what's happening with morning Land.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nMorning Land, they're closing them down because they supplied us?\n\n  \r\n\r\nWe've got video conferencing now.\n\n I can look at the patient, we've got those small magnifying microscopes connected to USB, put it right up against the eye, right there I take a photo of it.\n\n I can do anything now, but I'll just have to do it off of Skype or somewhere where there's a lot of traffic.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf course, you've got trouble with Skype is cut off and stuff like that, but it's hard to track or call.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou get a pretty good, accurate.\n\n Those new microscopes, they're only like $400, they're pretty good.\n\n And you just have to have somebody that has a good computer and good internet transmission quality.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, where are you gonna go now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nI don't know?\n\n Don't have a clue.\n\n I just take one at a time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\n\r\nYou gonna stay here on the West Coast for a while or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, yeah, I will definitely?\n\n This will still be my home until they kill me.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about that place in Thailand where you built your house.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but they're trying to take all that land, even the land that the house is on, they're trying to take?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo.\n\n The house that you just built?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThe house that I just built, they said that's on forestry protective land too?\n\n So, I got real angry at them.\n\n At the last meeting, there were judges, there were policemen, there was land authority, there was the forestry department and there were attorneys and the city attorney all together.\n\n This I don't want printed cuz I promised them I wouldn't.\n\n And they all said, give us 200,000, we'll go away.\n\n The whole issue will go away.\n\n I said, \"You're just trying to extort money from me.\n\n That's what this is all about.\n\n I'm bringing good wealth to your country and all that\"?\n\n \r\n\r\nI said, \"Do you know.\n\n You're trying to fuck the wrong man\".\n\n And that's just what I said.\n\n I said, \"I will go online and I'll report this to all the people out there on this diet, and there are at least 40,000 people interested in this diet and what I'm doing.\n\n Take a look at Sunday's paper a few weeks ago.\n\n You've got the whole city attorney being embarrassed for coming into my Rawsome club with guns raised and trying to extort and play with us\".\n\n I said, \"Do you want the same embarrassment\".\n\n I said, \"You're screwing with the wrong man if you think you're gonna do that to me\"?\n\n  \r\n\r\nThey all sat back and I left, I left that the next morning.\n\n So, I have no idea what's happened and I won't know until I go back.\n\n I don't know if I will have land and a house or not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nWhat about the Philippines.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNo, that's just now being built?\n\n When I left, just the piles were built to build the house, so, my houses are all nine feet tall.\n\n Taller than this because it rained so much there anything on the ground smelled like mold.\n\n You go into a hotel, if you're on the first floor, everything smells like mildew and mold.\n\n So, I don't want that for my house.\n\n So, everything's 9 feet up, three meters.\n\n So, then they have to build a deck and then the house on top of the deck.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, who was the guy that the people that owned the land and you made their kids better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThat was the Philippines?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, you're okay in the Philippines.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYep?\n\n They stopped me from digging my lake.\n\n I have dug a lake in Thailand and they came and took the backhoe and the machinery and impounded it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThis is in the middle of nowhere, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThis is in the middle of nowhere?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nAnd they got anything better to do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWho else would be behind it?\n\n They don't know who I am?\n\n I'm way out in the toolies, my name isn't even on anything.\n\n I've got Thai partners and all them show that they own it.\n\n I've got a patient here who's Thai and she's the main owner, but they know the word is around, they follow me.\n\n \r\n\r\nI don't turn my cell phone on where I go, only time I turn it on is when I absolutely have to use it for an emergency.\n\n I don't use credit cards, I will buy a ticket right before I get on the plane, sometimes I will buy a ticket ahead of time on my credit card, but never get on that plane.\n\n \r\n\r\nI'll get on the next one or one the next day or the day previous to that, I pull all kinds of stuff.\n\n It's a lot more expensive and I'm going down in my savings, but my safety is more important to me, so I have to play games like that.\n\n And I've got little bitty sensor devices that I have at the windows and the doors, anybody comes in, makes a very hundred watt, sounds like a very loud bird squelch.\n\n So, I mean, it just shock and bring me out of sleep or anybody, wake anybody up and shock anybody's trying to break in.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, I use those.\n\n I have a taser gun, which is 1 million watts and if I hit somebody with that just for one second, they won't move for five minutes, if I hit 'em for three seconds, they won't move for 15, 20 minutes.\n\n If I hit 'em for 30 minutes [might've meant 30 seconds.\n\n], their brain won't function?\n\n They'll be brain dead.\n\n And if I caught those two guys that had been injecting me and I had had my taser next to me and been able to do something about it, they would not be alive today I guarantee you.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey would've been brain dead; I would've just put that taser on their neck or on their temple till the brain stopped working.\n\n That was it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOr give him for a couple seconds and then inject in him.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n*Laughs* you know, they deserve to be dead.\n\n Deadly force for that.\n\n  \r\n\r\nOh yeah.\n\n They buried that my hot tub, everything.\n\n So, I'm a little bitty bungalow cottage up on the same estate, but I have to leave by November 20th.\n\n They told me I had to leave by October 20th, and I said, \"Make me, take me to court.\n\n Make me, I'll be here until January if you do that, but I promise you I'll be out by November 20th\".\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm going to find another place to live and move to another

in Fort Lauderdale area, the Boca Ra?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nThey're just so afraid of people really getting the truth, and once it gets out, they're gonna be blown up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWell, you have to look, like I said in my newsletter this week, I said they are afraid of another revolution.\n\n 1776 happened because people were healthy, eating off the farm, not eating chemicals in their food, not getting fluoride in their water.\n\n Fluoride causes docility in animals to the point where if you put it in their water, they will be killed by their peers, they won't fight back.\n\n  \r\n\r\nHitler used it to make his prisoners in the concentration camps docile.\n\n Why do they think you're trying to get it in everybody's water.\n\n San Diego has fought it off for

for 6 - 10 weeks, diabetes was completely reversed.\n\n Of course, they were getting milk un refrigerated.\n\n It was right out of the cow.\n\n They were drinking it fresh.\n\n\r\nBig difference.\n\n Now, if I put somebody on just a raw milk diet, impossible for our society.\n\n It's difficult to do that just on raw milk.\n\n It will take 3 - 6 months to reverse that diabetes, but still it's reversible.\n\n Usually in two months if I put somebody on dairy and a meat diet with lots of raw eggs, their diabetes symptoms are gone in three weeks.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, i was diagnosed with diabetes too, I don't have it anymore.\n\n Doctor called me up last Thursday, said, \"Hey, I did a test.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou never had it, that's what I'm saying.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, I changed my diet, I feel a lot better.\n\n I lost 30 pounds and the working out and everything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDifferent life.\n\n You're finally feeding your body something it wanted and needs and can utilize properly.\n\n  So, that's all the difference in the world.\n\n \r\n80% - 85% of the diabetics that come to me, all they do is go on a different diet and they're asymptomatic.\n\n\r\nThose that are truly diabetic may take 6 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 months, 6 months, but after 6 months, they're not diabetic.\n\n I only have two patients who had been taking insulin for over 35 years, they still take three units a day just in case .\n\n Okay, who cares.\n\n Three units, big deal?\n\n That's a big difference from taking their 28 to 30 to 40 a day, 43 a day down to 3.\n\n And they just do it for insurance.\n\n That's how hard the medical profession has worked on their brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut doctor tells you you're diabetic saying your body can't produce insulin.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, saying that it doesn't manufacture insulin, or you're producing a poor insulin quality that doesn't make the excess sugars into glycogen?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Soy Chicken, Getting Amish Chicken \n \n**[2010],[Lisa]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI haven't been eating much eggs\n\n I still feel better when I eat

feed?\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nBut it's pretty much in there already.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n It's like Rocky Junior is the best chicken.\n\n If I had to eat chicken, I would eat Rocky Junior, as I did before, it's only 25 % - 35% soy.\n\n Rosie is 85% soy.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nDo you know what Henry's is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot now?\n\n I knew back then, but who knows.\n\n You have to call them every year and see if they've changed.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nBecause if you feel better on the eggs, what's been your side effect of soy GMO.\n\n What does the GMO cause?\n\n Cancer?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they cause deformities, they cause hormonal imbalances, hey cause severe allergies?\n\n In some laboratory, they killed them within 1/3 of their normal life.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nIt's like I'm feeling better, but maybe I'm getting worse.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's like vitamin supplements.\n\n They can make you feel better, but in the long run they're gonna knock you down.\n\n \r\nJust have to use coconut cream and dairy cream until you get the eggs.\n\n Not the same.\n\n We have to do the best we can.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nHow long can you go without eggs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I've gone as long as six weeks with without eggs in the past?\n\n\r\nI've been already talking with the Amish farmers as recently as five days ago and they said they can get it together in 2 - 3 weeks, and ship it to us.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nWe are gonna order it on phone and gonna get the cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I'm going to bring it into LA, I'm gonna have it shipped it into LA and then we can distribute it from there.\n\n Just have to have somebody come up and get it or somebody have to bring it down here.\n\n \r\nWe'll have chickens and we have eggs.\n\n There will be, right now, they can supply us only with about probably 30 dozen a week eggs and maybe 20 chickens a week, that's all they can supply.\n\n And I said, I need 200 dozen a week , and I need 60 chickens a week.\n\n He's going to go to his family of Amish farmers and get their chickens from them so they can haul it all in one place and control the quality the way I want it.\n\n \r\nThrow your scrap meats out, of course you got dogs to feed the same way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou need a rooster.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nif you want them fertile, but you don't need them fertile.\n\n The reason I put fertile in the book was because you knew that if they were getting screwed, they were all running around and not just in a cage this small.\n\n\r\nI tried it up there in Malibu, but the first week the cayotes had eaten all but two.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nSo, you didn't put a cage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, I had a cage, but they broke into the cage?\n\n One even went through my, I had a screen door like that one came right through, had a chicken on the screen, and I was right there in the room *laughs*.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's not just the cayotes, the raccoons will get them.\n\n Possums too.\n\n**[Lisa]**\n\r\nI need a bigger do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, the small dogs are good.\n\n They make noise.\n\n Yeah.\n\n Cayotes are annoyed by little dogs and their noise.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Soy Eggs \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRaw range fed, fertile eggs, and I'm going, okay, these would be ones to buy\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMostly they're grown with soy and they'll say organic.\n\n Soy cannot be given to chickens raw, so they have to chemically treat it with a kerosene derivative and heat treat it.\n\n So, anytime a chicken is fed soy, it has to be processed.\n\n\r\nSo, all of the organic, now I've gone to, like Rosie says all organic, they feed their 75% - 80% soy.\n\n And I called them up and I said, \"You can't do that.\n\n Soy raw will kill a chicken.\n\n So, you've had to have treated it\".\n\n \r\n\"Yeah, but the soy was grown organically\".\n\n \r\n\"I don't care.\n\n It's no longer organic when you're feeding it to the chickens\".\n\n\r\n\"Well, the FDA lets us call it that\".\n\n That was their answer.\n\n This is Rosie Organic Chicken, and let me tell you, I've been to about every chicken place around and they all feed them the same garbage feeds.\n\n Only place I can find where they don't do that is in Amish and Mennonite Farms and where I get ours now and I've been trying to get James to just get our Amish farmers because they supply everything else.\n\n Give us their eggs and chickens too.\n\n The chickens are gonna be tougher.\n\n You know, they're eating organically wild food.\n\n \r\nAnd what I do is I said, I don't want the chickens to have a lot of grains because chickens in the wild don't eat a lot of grains.\n\n They eat a lot of bugs, grass hoppers, they eat a lot of meat.\n\n They're scavengers, if they find a dead animal.\n\n They'll pick it to pieces and the bugs that are eating them.\n\n They love maggots.\n\n \r\nSo, what I'd like you to do is get a pallet after you butcher, throw all the remains on the pallet and let the chickens have whatever they want.\n\n And the chickens just feed on it every day.\n\n And these chickens, I don't know how many people have been around chickens.\n\n They peck each other, they're very annoyed with each other.\n\n They're not happy.\n\n Those chickens will walk around like cats and rub you up against the ankles and legs.\n\n When they feed them the way I want them to with the raw meats, the meat scraps and the maggots and stuff.\n\n\r\nAnd they also feed them some grains, some peas that are organically grown, that they grow themselves.\n\n So, they'll crush those up and then they take some grains that they grow and they'll soak it in whey and the whey germinates it.\n\n So, they're sprouted in whey.\n\n So, these chickens get these sprouted in whey grains, raw milk, and then all this meat and they are the most beautiful chickens.\n\n Lay the best eggs in the world, it's phenomenal.\n\n \r\nYou just can't get those, your big markets, your big chicken houses, your people who make them and produce them for your big stores, they're all big marketing houses with very poor grade feed.\n\n None of its organic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about the guys at the farmers market that do have their local little farms.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're feeding them regular feed?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMaybe they're pastured.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey're pastured, but they're still getting regular garbage feed?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIsn't that better though.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's probably a little better, yeah?\n\n But when you're feeding an animal soy that isn't supposed to eat soy that has to be heat treated and chemically treated.\n\n\r\nHow many of you would eat a peach or even nuts that have been soaked in kerosene for 30 minutes, rinse it off and eat it.\n\n That kerosene etches its way deep into the tissue in 30 minutes?\n\n It's like gasoline.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, where are you buying eggs from.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight now, none?\n\n I'm making deals with the farmers in the Amish territory right now.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat area.\n\n Texas?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, mainly Ohio area?\n\n Ohio, Pennsylvania.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAmos.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAmos and other people?\n\n Amos is already full.\n\n I've got him stretched.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre there any names you can give us that we can order.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, not right now?\n\n I'm still trying to set it up.\n\n There's no big chicken farmer in the Amish right now, so I'm trying to establish one.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Suaerkraut, Salt \n \n**[2010],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nSometimes I make sauerkraut\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYou like to be sour.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nNo?\n\n I was gonna ask that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nFine, but no salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nUse what.\n\n Whey?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nWhey or lemon juice or vinegar?\n\n Okay.\n\n And if you're gonna use vinegar, just use a small amount cuz it will just melt it, unless you're gonna eat it right away.\n\n It'll make it faster.\n\n You can do sauerkraut in like 24 hours if you use vinegar, but if you use whey, it's gonna take 3, 4 days, 5 days.\n\n  \r\n\r\nIf you use lemon juice, it's not gonna taste as good, but it will break it down not quite as fast as vinegar does but close.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe reason you want do salt, because salt is an explosive, it's the most volatile, explosive on the planet.\n\n If you isolate pure sodium, a block of sodium this big will take out New York City, \r\n\r\nGeneral Electric was paid by the military over $2 trillion over the last 60 years to make a sodium an explosive that you could use as a war toy.\n\n It is so volatile; they can't control it.\n\n It's more volatile than nitroglycerin, 1.\n\n5° change can cause it to ignite.\n\n So, it's been impossible to do so they've given up for now.\n\n $2 trillion enough for you.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, what happens is when that goes in the body and your body isolates the sodium molecule from either the iodine or chloride, depending upon what kind of salt you're using, even if it's a natural salt, it breaks those clusters up, those clusters of minerals because it has to be in colonial form?\n\n \r\n\r\nColonial means absorbable into a cell as a nutrient, so it has to be like a uni-molecule of a mineral to be utilized properly.\n\n So, when the cell eats, there's a whole network, a whole smorgasborg of nutrients, anywhere from 97 - 117 nutrients: all your vitamins, all your minerals, your fats, all the 60 varieties of cholesterol that can be formed, all the different proteins, pyruvate, all the 22 amino acids.\n\n Everything is in the smorgasboard.\n\n When a cell eats, it gets the whole dose and it's completely neutrafied.\n\n  \r\n\r\nWhen salt is eaten, it causes these explosions of the nutrients, so you may only get 27, 57 nutrients into a cell at once, so every cell becomes deficient anytime you use salt with a meal.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot only that, it dehydrates cells, sometimes the sodium molecules isolated will attach to each other, even though sodium molecules is the smallest of all the elements.\n\n When they clump together, they create a very strong magnetism.\n\n So, when the cell opens and there is one or two ions inside, it traps the ions that are in that smorgasboard in there, if a cluster of sodium is passing, it can't go inside and the mechanism is so great, it rips the ions out of the cell and the cell will never eat again.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, the cell shrivels like a grape to a raisin, and that's it.\n\n So, 1 million blood cells are destroyed from one little bitty grain of salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, the animals, they put the salt blocks up for them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nThey don't really lick it that much?\n\n \r\n\r\nOne little bitty grain of salt.\n\n Normal table, not your big rock salt will kill 1 million red blood cells.\n\n Of course, that can fit on the head of a pin, but still, that's a lot of red blood cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nYou don't just eat one grain, you eat more.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nYeah.\n\n You sprinkle it on.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nOr you eat it and it comes in your food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nNow, there was a group of guys that said I was full of shit, didn't know what I was talking about.\n\n I said, \"Okay, take a freshly killed animal skin them, salt 'em and see what happened.\n\n So, they did it.\n\n You go online and look up frogs salt video.\n\n  \r\n\r\nYou see these guys, they think they're just playing around, they have no idea what's gonna happen.\n\n They're just following my instructions, so they put out these three frog legs that are cut from the waist down on the frogs and they turn 'em over.\n\n They sprinkle it all one side and then the other side.\n\n  \r\n\r\nNow it isn't like they poured a whole bucket of salt on 'em.\n\n They're sprinkling each one as somebody would sprinkle their dinner.\n\n All of a sudden you see these frog legs, now these are dead frogs.\n\n They've been dead for hours.\n\n These frog legs are going into spasms.\n\n They only let it on for two minutes, but it happened for 27 minutes.\n\n Those legs spasm from 27 minutes.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, they did it with pepper so you can go on there's also one on pepper, but they only use one frog legs cuz they only have 4 frogs.\n\n So, they sprinkle this pepper and they're laying the pepper on this poor frog leg and they're laying this pepper on a pepper and pepper.\n\n One spasm, and that's it.\n\n Pepper is a highly caustic substance that burns, burns tissue.\n\n \r\n\r\nThis is a dead organism, it doesn't feel that, but salt is an explosive, dead or not.\n\n It starts mixing with certain bodily and it's going to start exploding, and that's what causes this to to work.\n\n So, you can go online and check it out.\n\n So salt is bad, bad, bad, bad.\n\n Just like I said in my book, salt is the next worst thing to cooking.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (32) Tight Tendons \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs it here\n\n Is it here?\n\n Is it here?\n\n Where do you ache?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's like on the knees and then in the quads?\n\n Both quads, knees, the hamstring area.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSounds like your tendons are too tight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnything I can do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPineapple with coconut cream and some butter and putting hot water bottles on it at night?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Tinnitus = Hot Water Bottle \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTinnitus\n\n \r\nIs it high pitch, is it low pitch.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLow pitch?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHigh pitch, that's excessive fluid in your ears.\n\n What you do at night, you take a hot water bottle and you put it on one ear one night and let it evaporate.\n\n That'll take care of the ringing in that ear for two or three days until it builds up again.\n\n Then you do it on that ear, that cycle.\n\n\r\nYou can't do it on the same ear two days in a row, cuz then you'll be imbalanced and you'll lose your equilibrium and get dizzy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou sleep on the hot water bottle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, you sleep on the water bottle to let the excess fluid in the ear evaporate?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOther times when using the hot water bottle, you said you put it on the top.\n\n Not to lay on it, is that the case.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no, I say lay on the side, so you're not putting pressure on it and you're not putting pressure on it this way?\n\n You lay beside it, so the heat's moving upward at your head.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about clicking.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's dryness and the wax is getting in, the wax is moving, and that creates a clicking sound?\n\n That's wax in the ear.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow warm should the water be in the water bottles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWarm as you can take it, probably 130°, and then you wrap it with a flannel pillow case or a towel?\n\n Don't want to put that hot of a object right up against your ear, but close.\n\n Once the towel or the the wrapped flannel pillow case is on it, you've got a barrier between it, so that prevents it from being too hot.\n\n\r\nBut it takes at least probably 112° to get it to perspire in one night enough to remove the ringing in one night.\n\n\r\nIf it's a low pitch sound, that means you've got some kind of nasty fluid in there.\n\n Usually, when you have a lot of fluid, you've got a lot of heavy metals leaving the brain, trying to dump out the ear in the ear wax, so that'll create a high pitch sound.\n\n \r\nIf you have things like iron or lower vibrational metals, that brings a low sound, that's a little harder to remove.\n\n\r\nYou may have to do it every night, instead of every three nights.\n\n\r\nThat's a way to perspire it, but you need to leave it on a long time.\n\n It's so much easier and you don't have to, you can do it while you're asleep.\n\n You can't candle while you're asleep, so.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Tribes Who Ate Only Cooked Meat, Gout, Osteoporosis, Arthritis, Vegetable Oils \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, it wasn't just Western Price\n\n It's other researchers who went through those tribes.\n\n I don't think Western Price went to New Guinea, did he.\n\n Anyway, they studied the tribes in New Guinea because they were mainly meat eaters, they eat anything but meat?\n\n \r\n\r\nThey were mainly researchers of cardiology and there were archeologists and anthropologists who also had an interest in cardiac problems.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, they went to these tribes who ate only cooked meats, that was their whole diet.\n\n They didn't eat vegetables, nothing.\n\n Just cooked meats were all they ate, and they, they'd even eat humans.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd usually, it was a tribe they didn't like.\n\n They would snatch one when they're out hunting or something, grab 'em and cook 'em and eat 'em.\n\n So, they found that there were only five diseases, and they were gout, osteoporosis to an extent, arthritis and rheumatism, and I forgot the other one.\n\n  \r\n\r\nAnyway, there were no heart disease, no arterial sclerosis, nothing.\n\n  \r\n\r\nSo, you get arterial sclerosis and liver hardening and hardening of the heart from vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetables, which are plastic, they crystallize in the human body, so it hardens cells that are made with that oil will crystallize and harden.\n\n It is exactly the opposite and like I tell everybody, whatever you hear from the media, whatever you hear from the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry, 90 times times out of a 100, if you do the exact opposite, you'll be doing it correctly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\n\r\nSo, cirrhosised liver, a good friend of mine have cirrhosis because he was drinking, I think 20, 30 years ago.\n\n They were saying, well it was because he was drinking.\n\n So, what you would say is the hydrogenated oils could have affected his liver that way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\r\nIf we hadn't been up growing up in a polluted society, you have to understand these people are in the jungle?\n\n Their fire is the only pollution they have.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (35) What To Put On Toenail Injury, Herbs Are Bad \n \ninjury\r\nantiseptics\r\nlime\r\nfeet\r\naajonus\r\nbutter\r\n\n \n \n \n### (36) Where Aajonus Get Brain, Amos Non Frozen \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI get brains from Amos\n\n It's usually pigs brain or calves.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDoes any of the meat come from Amos.\n\n \r\nNone of it does, right?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, a lot of it comes from Amos?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can order meat from-.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe lamb, the pork?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut not beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere may be some there, you just have to check by the week?\n\n See what's available.\n\n Because Amos freezes a lot of his meat once it's butchered, so we only accept meat from him when he just butchered it and it's not frozen.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Women Ate Eggs With Emphysema and Doctors Acnt Recommend Alternative \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's why in my Recipe Book, I mentioned the woman who had emphysema and her doctor called me on a Thursday night and said, \"I've got a woman who's diagnosed with emphysema seven years ago, she'd been bedridden for most of the past two years, and she's been on machines for most of that two years and she's gonna die this weekend\n\n Is there anything I can do.\n\n\" \r\nI said, \"Well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you\"?\n\n She says, \"I'm a MD, and the law is that I cannot recommend anything to any alternative other than the standard medical procedures\", which are written by the pharmaceutical industry by the way, all medical procedure books are written by pharmaceutical industry?\n\n Merck's is about thick.\n\n And she said, \"Without 10 years of failure with medical therapies, I cannot suggest anything alternative, unless they're on the deathbed.\n\n She's on a deathbed now I can\".\n\n \r\nThat is the law.\n\n So you know, anytime you go to a doctor, a licensed MD, the only thing he can suggest for you is what the pharmaceutical houses suggest for you.\n\n That's it.\n\n I said, \"Well, that's your conscience.\n\n All I can do is say, get as many dozen eggs as you can, 10, 15, put 'em on her bed table and have her eat as many as she can and there's no limit\".\n\n \r\nSo, this is a Thursday night.\n\n It was 9:30 AM my time, so she was in Maine or Massachusetts.\n\n So it must have been 1:30 in the morning.\n\n This was a woman who cared, was just stuck in the medical profession.\n\n So, I got a call on Monday morning.\n\n Now, if this doctor had it all together, probably wouldn't have gotten the eggs to her before late Friday night or early Saturday morning.\n\n \r\nSo, Monday morning I get a call from this raspy voice woman saying, \"It worked, I'm out of bed.\n\n What else should I do\".\n\n I said, \"Well, who are you?\n\n\" And she said, \"Well, my doctor called and you told her that I should eat as many raw eggs as possible\"?\n\n So, I did that and I'm out of bed and off the machines.\n\n What else do you want me to do.\n\n\" I said, \"Well, how many eggs did you have to eat to do that?\n\n\"\r\nShe said, \"I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday, and I'm off the machines and out of bed\"?\n\n The point of that story is eggs digest so quickly, take very little of the body's energy and digestion, so the body has all that energy and all those wonderful nutrients.\n\n The liquid protein already, the liquified fat, which doesn't take any enzymes, only the bacteria has to invade it and eat it quickly.\n\n\r\nSo, in 27 minutes, it's absorbed and into your body working.\n\n That is the only food that you can give people who are in that critical condition to pull them through and it worked.\n\n Only 66 eggs and she was out of bed and off the machine after two years of living that way.\n\n Isn't there something terribly wrong with the medical industry.\n\n\r\nKept her suffering in bed and crippled for two years and suffering for seven years altogether?\n\n And I got a call from her six months later.\n\n I said, \"Well, what you can do, you stay on the eggs, you eat as many, you eat 30 a day for a year and a half and you can add raw dairy a little bit at a time, maybe 1/4 cup, three weeks later another ounce, so you have 3 ounces, 4 ounces every few months.\n\n You can increase it and eat some fish, some raw beef, some raw meats, and just increase your diet that way\".\n\n \r\nI got a call from a year later and I didn't even realize it was her voice.\n\n It's almost a normal voice, hardly any raspiness at all and very strong.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs this something that can actually apply to all these diseases.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, every one, especially Crohn's disease, people who have digestive problems?\n\n You have to give them a break in their digestion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat would actually help my pastor.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt could help anybody.\n\n I always tell people, eat lots of eggs if they have access to good eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Yellow Chicken, Gmo Corn \n \n**[2010],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, in those are fed corn, of course they're yellower naturally almost orange, but if it's GM0 corn, it leaves a bad aftertaste for me\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt can still be orangey if they're fed GMO corn.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI always thought it was the more orange they are the better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that just tells you whether they're giving grain, straight grain or soy or they're giving good rich corn.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut if they're getting grass and bugs, they get more of an orange.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, that too?\n\n Bugs especially and meat.\n\n\r\nThen they'll get very orange.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

once.\n\n\r\nDo you want me to help you.\n\n I can give you some raw milk?\n\n I can make you raw milkshakes, which will help.\n\n When I went there, he was white, as white as her top there.\n\n And he had four major sores that looked cancerous, but they weren't gonna treat him because he just had a stroke and they weren't gonna take a chance of him having another stroke.\n\n So, they weren't gonna treat these cancer like abrasions on his face.\n\n\r\nIn four days of milkshake, his color was completely back and all four sores had completely cleared.\n\n Not even scabs.\n\n That's cuz he was raised on raw milk on a farm.\n\n He reacts very well quickly to good foods.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, then that diet is great for a head trauma.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLots of milkshakes and

\n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSugar issues\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUnheated.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRaw agave.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, agave is not- it is a process?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've found someone and they are purely raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot.\n\n If they derive it themselves and they assure me of that with lawsuit damage and loss of their business, I'll go for it.\n\n\r\nOtherwise it isn't.\n\n It isn't stable.\n\n Agaveis not stable.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Bad Vs Good Meat, Costco Meat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou get the butter from a pasteurized butter\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's like this.\n\n If you buy Costco meats, let's say you're going to get a third of the nutrient value that you will from good organic grass fed beef.\n\n So, you're eating a lot more.\n\n You're spending just as much money.\n\n So, I don't get the point.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut Costco, they have organic meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* If you believe Costco, more power to you.\n\n\r\nI don't care what it says.\n\n Don't believe everything you read.\n\n Whole Foods all natural beef.\n\n So, when I investigated what they fed their cows, I called their office in Texas and said, \"What are you feeding your cows.\n\n You say it's all natural?\n\n What are you feeding them\".\n\n \"Well, we're feeding them all grains in their grazing, stuff like that\"?\n\n And I said, \"Okay, but what are you feeding them.\n\n Are you feeding them GMO corn?\n\n Are you feeding them soy?\n\n What are you feeding them?\n\n\" \"Well, we don't know that you have to go to the ranches\"?\n\n\r\nSo, I went to the person who's in charge of getting all the ranchers together, organizing, have the contract for Whole Foods and they fed 15% bakery way, stale donuts.\n\n Called all natural.\n\n So, I called whole foods at main office, and I said, \"You're saying all natural.\n\n You can't say all natural.\n\n You're feeding them stale donuts that are boiled in oil.\n\n That is not natural for cows\".\n\n \"But it's made out of their natural grain\".\n\n \r\nAnd that's their reasoning and their rationale.\n\n\r\nDonuts are made out of natural grain and cows can eat grain.\n\n That's their logic.\n\n So, you have to understand, you wanna know whether it's really organic.\n\n You go check?\n\n\r\nYou can't trust them.\n\n You have to go to the source.\n\n\r\nThat doesn't mean they're organic.\n\n Organic means they're fed only organic food that's never been processed.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Bledn Cucumbers and Peel Them, Collagen \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou got the cucumber\n\n Are you suggesting that instead of putting that through the juicer, we blend the cucumber.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou blend it, yeah?\n\n What you do is take your cucumber, you peel it.\n\n I don't care if it's organic, if you've grown it, don't peel it.\n\n \r\nBut a lot of people say, but all the nutrients are in the peel.\n\n Yeah.\n\n If you're a cow or a goat or a sheep, you'll be able to digest it.\n\n Otherwise you won't, and you can juice the pulp all day and you're not gonna get much of anything out of that skin.\n\n \r\nThe FDA allows them to call organic cucumbers, that have been waxed with a bees wax that has 15% paraffin in it, and that's motor oil, and it's kerosene based.\n\n So it's not a good healthy substance.\n\n \r\nSo, always peel your cucumbers unless you've grown them yourself.\n\n And then what you do is you juice your other juice and then you peel and slice your cucumbers, put 'em in a jar with some of your vegetable juice, so there's not much air space in there and blend it, and there you have your vegetable juice with the collagen precursor in cucumber pulp.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Brain Is A Garbage Dump \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMost of your metallic minerals to transport light and conduct electricity\n\n So, almost all the toxic minerals go to the brain.\n\n We don't have big brains because we're smart.\n\n We have big brains because it's a garbage dump for heavy metals.\n\n\r\nThe brain started getting larger the more we started using metals in industry for the wheel, for jewelry, stuff like that.\n\n The brain got larger and larger.\n\n The brain remained small as long as we were hunter gatherers.\n\n And when we started smelting metals, we started entering a lot of toxicity into the system and the brain dumps out the sinuses in the mouth.\n\n Lots of mucus necessary to do that, to protect those mucus membranes.\n\n\r\nSo if you got those good, thick honkies, more protection.\n\n\r\nYou swallow, you're entering those toxins into your system.\n\n If you're a healthy individual and you just got some dust in there, you created a lot of mucus to wash the dust out, so it didn't get into the mucus membranes.\n\n Swallowing it would be healthy, but most of the poisons leaving our brain are from canned foods, air pollution from your car exhaust and diesel fuel and stuff like that.\n\n Not a good thing\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Burtn Out Adrenals \n \n \n \n \n### (8) Butter and Dates For Thyroid \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor thyroid eating cheese and dates together, I mean, butter and dates together are one of the best ways to stimulate the thyroid gland\n\n Also, putting a hot water bottle at the side of your neck, or even two of them, and then taking a towel or silk shawl is a little bit more energetic and works a little better, and the only reason I believe in energies like that with different materials is because I've experimented with them.\n\n And I found that it is a fact, wool even works very well, but I found that silk works better.\n\n So, if you use like a silk shawl or scarf, and that covers the hot water bottle or the hot water bottles, intense the heat into the neck area.\n\n It keeps the heat where you want it, and it'll increase circulation to the thyroid gland or any area where you want to heal the body, cleanse and heal the body cuz you have a particular problem there.\n\n You put the hot water bottle there, add tent the heat into that area.\n\n \r\nIf you go to sleep with a hot water bottle under the covers, the whole bed's going to be heated.\n\n So, it doesn't really focus on one area.\n\n So, that's why you tent the heat into a particular area.\n\n And stay away from pine nuts, pine nuts reduce the production of thyroxin.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Ceviche, Lime Juice \n \n \n \n \n### (10) Chemical Sensitivity, Get Mucus \n \n \n \n \n### (11) Chemtrails \n \n \n \n \n### (12) Chicken Pox Is From Cereals and Grains \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, usually chickenpox is a food detoxification that children get about the same age\n\n It's usually from cereal.\n\n Chickenpox very rarely existed before breads ever came into existence.\n\n \r\nSo, chickenpox is mainly caused by breads and processed grains.\n\n It is a fungal type reaction in the body and it throws these poisons out to the skin, and because they're highly acidic with sugars, sugars that dissolve a lot of disaccharides and monosaccharides come out and they burn the skin as it comes out.\n\n And that's why they pox, cause the scarring, the damage to the skin.\n\n \r\nIt'll happen in a whole group of children.\n\n It doesn't happen one place, it'll happen over a whole city, two cities, three cities.\n\n\r\nAny kind of a detox is always associated with humidity and temperature and the toxicity within the particular child.\n\n Not everybody gets the chicken pox.\n\n Everybody got chicken pox but me, but I got everything else.\n\n And then when everybody else didn't have chicken pox I got the chicken pox all by myself.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Chronic Overeating, Sugar Will Destroy Ecoli \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's never from that directly because the body is use to being in trauma, it has a higher nutritive need\n\n Stress will burn up a lot of nutrients, especially B vitamins quickly.\n\n Then your body's hungry for a lot of B vitamins.\n\n \r\nOnly way you can balance that is eating a lot of eggs and meat and milk and making sure your, your intestines work well, your E coli is plentiful.\n\n If it isn't, you need to stay away from anything that will cause contamination in the bowel, and that's a lot of fruit.\n\n Fruit will destroy the ability, ripe fruit will destroy the ability, sugars will destroy  the coli, enemas, colonics will destroy it.\n\n\r\nWhen  the food moves from the ileocecal valve into the colon, the E coli they're plentiful, and they just keep eating away and eating away at the food, their discard, which is shit and urine, their discard is our food.\n\n They've digested it for us.\n\n They've separated and fractioned it for us.\n\n So, that's where we derive all these nutrients, as it passes through, all that digestion is occurring, and then when we get to the descending colon and at the sigmoid colon finally is where all that stuff starts being absorbed.\n\n So, the sigmoid colon, almost all of it is just ripped out of the fecal matter.\n\n\r\nThat's why you get very dry right there, and if you get very dry right there, that means your body is very hungry.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Clay In Hot Bath \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd of course he could eat the cheese to help draw out the toxicity from the anesthesia\n\n Okay.\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n On using clay in the hot bath.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWho told you use clay in hot bath?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nIn your book?\n\n\r\nIf you like have a jacuzzi or hot tub, can you just keep recycling that same clay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll it'll be forever good?\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nForever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nForever good?\n\n As long as you had sand with it, and say you're using like a Hayward sand filter and you put clay in it, that clay will stay with the sand and they work together to filter, and it will never go bad.\n\n \r\nEven if it goes to black soot, it still is good.\n\n It may stink a little bit, like a sewer.\n\n And if you don't like that stench, then you need to flush it.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nDo you know of a good cheap source of clay for baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can go to Terramin and get their crude stuff they use for fertilizer?\n\n\r\n It's cheaper.\n\n Buy it by the bags.\n\n But make sure it isn't the stuff they put extra stuff in like bone calcium or something like that.\n\n Bone meal, don't want that.\n\n You just want the straight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Colonics Are Bad \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nColonics are never good\n\n They rub you of E coli and E coli is the final stage of digestion.\n\n They are responsible for the final stage of digestion, the fats and the proteins to make them into that finite molecule to feed the brain and the nervous system and to release all the B vitamins from your protein.\n\n Whether it's meat or dairy.\n\n\r\nThey are said to even manufacture in their excrement, which is called a verotoxin.\n\n The medical profession, scientists of course come up with naming something as a toxin that they want you to be afraid of.\n\n \r\nBut the verotoxin according to the University of Toronto in association with the children's hospital of Toronto have found that the \"verotoxin\" from E coli completely dissolves human brain tumors in two to five days.\n\n So, cancerous, malignant brain tumors in two to five days.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFasting.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFasting's not good?\n\n Like I said in my book, but let me finish with that.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cooked Meat and Dairy, Prostate Cancer \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's only if they're cooked or pasteurized\n\n Cooked and pasteurized meat and dairy are a problem.\n\n Absolutely.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHe was on the diet a number of years.\n\n What's that.\n\n Like 10 years?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHe had filled his body with a lot of toxins and he wouldn't get fat, remember?\n\n \r\nSo, it's cooked meat and pasteurized dairy that are a problem with any cancer?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThe quality of the dairy and meat, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTo an extent?\n\n If you're having pasteurized, hormone treated dairy with no cream in it, you've got a real problem.\n\n If it's skim milk, you've got a real problem because you got no fat to control that toxicity that's in that protein, in the chemically produced dairy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Detox and Dont Always Feel Wel On Diet \n \ndetox\r\nstrict\r\ncooked food\r\ndoctors\r\nmental function\r\n\r\n\n \n \n \n### (18) Dizzines Flu In Ear \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHe's having dizziness right now\n\n Dizziness is always two things after a surgery: it's the lowering of blood sugar and the lowering of fat at the same time.\n\n If you're dizzy, normally, you must be a female.\n\n I'm glad I gotta laugh with that.\n\n I thought, oh, I better not play with that, but I.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[joke]**\n\r\nNo, when you're dizzy, otherwise it's usually an imbalance of fluid from one ear to the other.\n\n That's what cause mainly causes vertigo.\n\n You've got more fluid in one ear than the other.\n\n So, to get rid of fluid in one ear to the other, you put a hot water bottle there at night tented around that area, so you perspire those fluids out that one a ear and that will lower it.\n\n\r\nYou can always tell which ear it is, cuz that'll allow more pressure on that ear.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou put it in a towel.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot in a towel.\n\n You put the hot water bottle there and you tent, you put the towel over your head like this, so you're tenting the heat into the whatever side of the head.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs the bottle touching your skin or no.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou don't want it touching cause you put pressure against it and you can't make it very hot that way, and if you want it along many hours, Then you need the hot water bottle hotter, but it can't be too close to the body?\n\n\r\nSo, with his situation, give him some honey and butter is a good way because when honey's raw, it's only 10% sugar and it's 90% enzymes for digesting fats and proteins, mainly proteins, secondarily fats.\n\n So, the honey and butter mixture will help after a surgery that kind of dizziness, cause that doesn't have to do with a hemorrhage or an aneurysm or anything like that.\n\n\r\nIt's a nutrient deficiency.\n\n And especially it happens from anesthesia, and a lot of people experience that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Doctors Giving Dad Glycerin \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTo say something, it was like he lost his thought and couldn't think of what to say or couldn't find the words, and it usually occurred after he drank something\n\n So, after about a day and a half, I realized that every time he drank a fluid, it was a very thick stuff like aloe vera juice, but it was made with glycerin.\n\n So, they put glycerin in everything, so he wouldn't choke on fluids.\n\n So, apple juice with glycerin and everything had glycerin in it that he drank, and within 10 minutes of drinking it, he would go stupid.\n\n \r\nSo, I told the hospital, \"Oh no, it's okay\".\n\n I said, \"Listen, I am a biochemist, so I know what's happening.\n\n Your doctors come in and prescribe and they don't stay 10 minutes with a patient.\n\n They have no idea what's wrong with that patient.\n\n They just look at their figures on a chart.\n\n They don't know what's going on with the patient.\n\n They've got these measurements that they look at, the blood test analysis, urine analysis, and they look at figures.\n\n  They're not looking at the patient.\n\n That is not only ignorance, that is stupidity\".\n\n So, it took me a day and a half to get them to stop, and I was very nice about it.\n\n I said, \"Look, this is what's happening.\n\n I think you should take him off of it\".\n\n \r\nBy the evening, and they didn't stop.\n\n I said, I know it is I've observed it.\n\n So, you need to take him off of it.\n\n The next day he was still having it.\n\n I said, I'm not asking you anymore.\n\n I'm demanding that you take him off of any kind of a fluid.\n\n If he chokes a little bit, you just stop feeding him for a few minutes and let him get through, but don't feed him any of that stuff anymore, and I mean it.\n\n\r\nOf course, that night they took him off of it.\n\n The next day he had no dumbness.\n\n He didn't go into that stuper.\n\n We had a conversation the whole day, the whole day.\n\n Thank God for the first time in 25 years, he agreed to drink raw milk.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Doctors Put Iodine and Mercury On Skin, Heal Skin \n \n \n \n \n### (21) Does Aajonus Eat Cooked Grains \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nA

the nervous system\n\n So, you have to have a good clean environment.\n\n  \r\nAnd if you need to squirt some kefir up there that's naturally made, less honey for that environment, that's why I only use a quarter of teaspoon with the coconut cream, the butter and the dairy cream to insert it in there.\n\n When you do that, that helps that  E coli environment.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Eggs Digest In 23 Minutes \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, it will because remember, the egg digest in 23 minutes, 23 minutes, all that protein and, and fats are available instantly with very little digestion, very little digestive effort\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen is the egg out of the first stomach.\n\n So, can I eat an egg 10 minutes before I do a workout?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n10 minutes before.\n\n It's got a first stomach that fast.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\nIt holds up in the duodenum a little bit longer cuz of the bile dumping in to use the egg yoke, but that's still not very long.\n\n Probably five minutes, it's left the stomach.\n\n \r\nIt takes very little hydrochloric acid because all the egg white is already liquid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut can you take it 5 minutes before a strenuous hour long workout.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n But you're gonna get hungry.\n\n You're gonna get hungry with only an egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI get maybe a little tired, but I never experienced hunger.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Well, you've got enough weight on you, so that's good.\n\n Probably okay.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) Enema Recipe \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the nutrient that the E coli has released to help balance that, you can take three tablespoons each of butter, cream, coconut cream, quarter teaspoon of honey, and put that in the 4-ounce jelly jar\n\n You shake it, put it little hot water, get it up to about 100°, 102°.\n\n\r\nRemember the cow heats up to 105°, cow's body temperature up to 105°, 101° - 105°.\n\n So, you can take dairy up to that temperature.\n\n When that little tiny bit of honey is mixed with that cream from the cow, it will not damage it.\n\n Honey normally is damaged 93° on, and it turns it all back into sugar.\n\n So, that much heat with that little bit of honey is not a contradiction with that cream.\n\n \r\nSo, you take an enema bulb syringe, like a four ounce one, eight ounce if that's all you have, a two ounce little baby one, but you have to do it in two stages if you do with the two ounce one.\n\n \r\nAnd then right before you go to sleep, you get on all fours, you bark like a dog and then insert it in you.\n\n And when you're doing it, don't get excited.\n\n You provide this and then you insert it in you and then get down all fours, roll your stomach like a belly dancer, cuz you don't wanna remove it.\n\n You want it to stay in you and then you just roll over on your left side, roll your stomach again and that'll move it in.\n\n\r\nSo, what will happen is it will lubricate the sigmoid colon and once it's finished lubricating that and the fecal matter, it'll go further up into the colon and feed the E.\n\ncoli.\n\n I will help preserve the coli and make them stronger, so then you won't have constipation for four or five days and some people have to do that every four or five days, especially people with high anxiety stress.\n\n\r\nNow, most people have that kinda stress any kind of abuse because.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Everybody Has Cancer Cells \n \n \n \n \n### (26) Fat With Cheese For Constipation \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou wanted me to do the sugar cube size of raw cheese with either butter or coconut cream\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOnly if you were constipated.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, I need something, either butter or coconut cream.\n\n But what I found is, and it's been working out great.\n\n I've had three big detoxes, worked out very well cause of all the chemical solvents, but the raw butter, for some reason swells up my front gum line.\n\n I get an abscess.\n\n\r\nWhen I eat the coconut cream with the cheese, I don't have an issue or problem.\n\n Why is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nButter has a particular molecular structure that helps get rid of Novocain and Xylocaine, any kind of injected dental, chemical anesthetic?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nShould I be doing butter with the cheese versus coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I would a little of both, so you're not going to have such a heavy detox?\n\n\r\nIf you do the heavy detoxification, you'll even get numb sometimes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI can literally feel the toxin collecting it.\n\n I mean, I can feel it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's all dental crap.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah.\n\n I have a lot of dental.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs there a way to gently detox, I've just got tons of Novocain from dental work.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, you're going to have a good time?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat do you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou're gonna have good times?\n\n You're gonna have abscesses and boils and everything coming out, unless you have another way to do it.\n\n\r\nYour body may invent some way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, using just coconut cream is not enough, I need for butter with it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n I would alternate, one time with butter, one time with coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs one better than the other.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't matter?\n\n The fat with the cheese is just to keep you from getting constipated.\n\n\r\nI said, if you use three tablespoons each of coconut cream, butter and dairy cream and a quarter teaspoon of honey mix those together in four ounce jelly jar, immerse it in a bowl of hot water until it gets a little above body temperature, like 101 degrees, and then shake it up again, put it in a bulb syringe, and then insert it in you before you go to sleep, hold it, maintain it, and that will lubricate the whole sigmoid colon where most of the dryness of occurs.\n\n Cause the body's soaking up all the E.\n\ncoli digested matter at that point, mainly your B vitamins and your proteins and fats digested to the right molecular structure at that point where 94% of constipation happens there for that reason.\n\n\r\nAnd if you put those fats in there, it will lubricate and sigmoid colon and go up and feed the rest of the E.\n\ncoli and benefit them.\n\n So, then you won't even have to worry about eating the butter or the coconut cream with the cheese.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Fecal Matter Vs Suppostory, Pig Bowel Best \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt is a good helpful thing\n\n However, if you're eating the E coli from a Buffalo or a cow, it's a different E coli.\n\n The E coli feeds on vegetation, even though by the time the vegetation is in the cow's colon, it's an entirely acidic environment, it's still slightly different.\n\n \r\nIf you get a pigs intestines and eat the bowel of a pig, that's perfect for us.\n\n Our system is 86% like a pigs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhen do you recommend eating feces.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnytime you want?\n\n I don't recommend eating feces that's already dried because the E.\n\n coli's inactive.\n\n And all of their little offspring won't become active easily.\n\n\r\nI have some Amish farmers who will harvest it when they're butchering their pigs, and what they'll do is you say a pound, two pounds of it.\n\n They'll tie it off, like it's a sausage, and then when you get it, you take just like a two ounce section, and eat that until it's gone and they usually will take care of you for at least a year, six months to a year, and then do it again if you still need help.\n\n\r\nOr you can eat high meat, the bacteria in the meat predigests the fats and the proteins to be able to feed the brain and the nervous system.\n\n \r\nThink about it this way, the high meat stinks like hell yeah, it'll stink up your house, the poop, you're eating over a short period of time and you don't have to have it all the time cuz remember the E coli from the poop is going to help your E coli thrive and live.\n\n \r\nWhen you eat high meat, it does not help the E.\n\n coli breed.\n\n So, what you're doing is eating all the pre digested fats and proteins to feed your brain and nervous system.\n\n It works because you get happy in 20 minutes, you can go from deep, dark depression to happiness in 20 minutes, just by feeding your nervous system.\n\n\r\nSo, remember, depression is always a lack of B vitamins and proteins and fats for the nervous system, E coli is responsible for making that grade of nutrient.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Fibroids, Breakign Down Scar Tissue \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nInformation you have about fibroids, the cause and how to attack that\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFibroids are caused by a collection of dead cells or tumors?\n\n It can be from something you're discharging.\n\n Are you talking about vaginal fibroids.\n\n\r\nYou're discarding something through that tissue that's damaging cells in that area and the the dead cells don't get dissolved, so the dead cells are mummified and they retain in that area?\n\n So, they're tumors, fibroids are tumors.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut benign tumors.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n They're a collection of dead cells with no cancer cell.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you suggest to remove that in the body.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLike I said in the book, anything to remove scar tissue: coconut oil, coconut cream, olive oil, flax oil?\n\n Things like that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nInternally.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nInternally?\n\n If you're eating a combination of like one tablespoon of flax oil or olive oil with some coconut cream, that's a better type of solvent to remove that.\n\n \r\nOr you could have it with avocado, a tablespoon of flax oil or olive oil with avocado.\n\n That's a fairly good cleanser.\n\n Coconut cream is always your best, cuz the coconut cream, like the avocado, has water soluble fats and vitamins as well as the oil soluble.\n\n \r\nIn your olive oil and flax oil.\n\n it's only your oil soluble fats and vitamin.\n\n So, it's a very restricted solvent that can be produced for that.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about coconut oil.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCoconut oil, again, it doesn't have the water soluble fats and vitamins, and it isn't as caustic as the olive oil and flax oil?\n\n So, it won't break down scar tissue as easily.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Gluten \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs that a myth about gluten and ligaments\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPardon?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike are gluten and ligament like efficiency or like how the ligaments spread out is that meant being associated with eating gluten?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, that depends on if the gluten is passing out in a way that will go to the joints, all depends upon the individual, but that can definitely be a problem?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMy girlfriend was, they gave her surgery cause of her knees and she swears it was because she had to much gluten nd it created something in her intestinal tract.\n\n So, they did a poor surgery on her knees and it messed her up.\n\n So, she's kind of had that same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere's so many reasons for it.\n\n There's so many reasons.\n\n\r\nAnd of course, gluten can be part of the reason.\n\n\r\nThere's no isolated gluten anywhere.\n\n In fact, if you're gonna eat grains once in a while, then bread, you're getting gluten in it.\n\n Right.\n\n You know, but I say tons of raw butter, or avocado or some raw fat with that bread.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMillet, quinoa, anything like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't eat cooked grains, except when I'm in Asia and I don't have milk for a while or  dairy products enough, like cream?\n\n I take my butter with me, but I get very hungry.\n\n So, the only way I can curb that constant craving to eat.\n\n I mean, I can eat five, six pounds of meat a day and still be unsatisfied cuz I don't get cream and cream is very important for my body.\n\n So, I will eat a about third a cup of rice.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Having Trouble Eatign Every Few Hours, Lube Formula and Fishfor Meditative State \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm having a little trouble with the crossover of eating every three, four hours\n\n Plus I'm doing yoga twice a day, straight for at least an hour, sometimes two.\n\n\r\nAnd I'm not supposed to eat like three hours before yoga.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWho says.\n\n That's if you're eating cooked foods, that's not if you're eatign raw foods?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat's what I wanted to find out.\n\n So, what's better.\n\n Like an egg or an eight ounces of milk, 16 ounces of milk?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on what you want to achieve in your yoga?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n I just wanna have the food in me.\n\n What I eat before, does it matter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends on what you want to achieve?\n\n Is it to create a better, more flexible body.\n\n Or is it for meditation?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nA little bit of both?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then eat fish with something, eggs or some butter.\n\n The lubrication formula and fish.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMost of the time, it's like, I'm getting up and I've been sleeping for three hours or four hours and I'm afraid to have an egg or two, like I used to prioritize doing yoga because I might be getting up in another hour, doing my yoga.\n\n\r\nSo, then sometimes I'm done it with my yoga and I realize it's been six or seven hours since I eat something.\n\n So, you're saying I can eat like an egg an hour before my yoga practice, 40 minutes before my yoga practice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because remember the egg digests in 23 minutes, it only uses three inches on the intestines.\n\n\r\nSo, you're gonna be very hungry with just an egg.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI'm thinking of like milk or an egg.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHave your milkshake, that's fine.\n\n But if you really want a meditative state where you can transcend something, lubrication formula with fish.\n\n it'll help flexibility, it'll help everything.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd you're saying how much before I begin my practice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n40 minutes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\n40 minutes, it'll be completely digested.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot completely, enough to keep you from getting hungry for two, three hours and do the job.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n And same thing with a milkshake.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBut it'll be out of the stomach?\n\n\r\nThat's the point, be outta the stomach and duodenum.\n\n Duodenum is the second part of the stomach.\n\n It'll be completely out of the stomach, including the duodenum within 40 minutes, that meal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhether it is a whole milkshake or the lubrication.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWith the fish, yes?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNow, what if I just have the lubrification, mostly I'm having chicken around the house right now.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n Then chicken and the lube formula.\n\n That way you won't get hungry during your whole exercise, you'll be able to stay focused.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Hemeroids \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHemorrhoids are a little different\n\n Hemorrhoids is when blood is your decontaminator.\n\n Your blood is acting as a filter like the lymph system, and it's binding with heavy metals and toxins that are in the bottom or rectal area, even in the prostate.\n\n The blood is your cleanser.\n\n That's that show a very advanced state of toxicity in the in the urinary and bowel area.\n\n\r\nSo, what happens.\n\n You get a cyst that's full of blood?\n\n That blood is highly contaminate.\n\n When I've had the blood analyzed for toxicity.\n\n Remember your doctors, and chemists will always look for bacteria.\n\n They're always looking for the microbe, bad guy, the microbe villain, but it's always the concentration of toxin.\n\n\r\nThe six that I've examined the blood from those hemorrhoids, high mercury, high lead, high cadmium.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHigh copper.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI haven't seen copper in a hemorrhoid?\n\n I've only seen six of them, it's $2,300 to analyze one sample.\n\n So, that's a lot of money ,I've spent over a million dollars and I'm finished with it.\n\n Well, once in a while I'm too curious.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Hormones, Tes, Estrogen, Adrenalie \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnxiety has nothing to do with that\n\n Anxiety is having a lot of hormones for physical energy.\n\n Let's say you have a lot of estrogen and a lot of testosterone, but no adrenaline.\n\n The adrenaline is the most is the kicker to make you wanna be active in physical and exercise, but the testosterone and the estrogen are also physical orienteers, but they don't have the motivation type activity involved in it.\n\n\r\nSo, you can have a lot of testosterone, a lot of estrogen in your system, but not be motivated to do anything, yet you have to physically utilize that in physical activity, or you're going to go into anxiety.\n\n So, you have to force yourself to exercise in that situation.\n\n If you've got anxiety, exercise is your key, period.\n\n\r\nSure.\n\n You can eat the nut formula to help to bind with some of that hormone, but usually you're producing it every day.\n\n You can't eat the nut formula every day.\n\n You shouldn't eat cooked starch every day to bind with it.\n\n You need to fricking exercise.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs miso and salt the same thing.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\nMiso is like 30% salt.\n\n Soy sauces, all of those are very concentrated in salt.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Infertility \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey won't reproduce and we've got that problem now\n\n The rate of impotency is tremendous, tremendous among young people.\n\n I went to Ohio to do a workshop last August after I left DC and I had three couples waiting for me there as soon as I got there to tell me that one couple had tried for 10 years to have a baby, another couple for 5 years and another couple, 5 years.\n\n And they all knew each other.\n\n \r\nAnd one went on the diet, got pregnant in 30 days on the diet.\n\n The other one went into it when she found about it from her couple friends, they got pregnant within 30 days.\n\n Third couple did too.\n\n All three couples got pregnant with just 30 days on the diet.\n\n They've been trying for years.\n\n One of 'em spent $126,000 on fertility clinics.\n\n\r\nAnd then all he needed was a good diet.\n\n That simple.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Is Chelation A Cure Or Heart Disease \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat's the only one that has a lot of EDTA in it, natural EDTA\n\n Not a synthetic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you think that the chelation is a cure for heart disease.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt is if it's a natural chelation?\n\n Now, the first time I was introduced into chelation therapy was in 1970 and I was working at some health food store on Melrose Avenue.\n\n\r\nThe fellow started doing EDTA in an alternative environment and his skin turned tissue paper thin, and he was dead in a year and a half from doing that, cuz it just thinned the walls internally and external, and that's the problem with it.\n\n Even vinegar will do that.\n\n .\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, did he have heart disease.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, he had heart disease?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut there are doctors that they do it intravenously in their office, and I know people that go two or three times a week.\n\n Supposedly, this way they avoid a bypass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey may avoid a bypass, but then they weaken the heart and the other tissues over the long run.\n\n\r\nSo, then what you have is bleeding.\n\n Now I did an experiment this weekend just to see how sensitive I was with it, and I mixed a tablespoon of vinegar with a tablespoon of honey and some vegetable juice.\n\n And I had that and I was in my hot tub last night and had a pretty nasty nose bleed.\n\n\r\nProbably lost about three tablespoons of blood.\n\n And I'm in that hot tub a lot in the winter if I'm home, not traveling and I've never had a nose bleed like that from being in a hot tub, but that's what vinegar can do very readily very quickly.\n\n\r\nSo, it was like 24 hours or 36 hours since I had the vinegar and the honey.\n\n So, it works very rapidly.\n\n The only reason I'm experimenting was cuz when I was in my early twenties, my carotid artery here was plaqued and it has the same plaque, it's never been removed.\n\n So I thought that I'm healthy enough now to start ripping that apart, dissolving it.\n\n  \r\nI know it's worked with EDTA, the natural source is vinegar, so it does work.\n\n You can tell using it on your teeth and heavy, heavy plaque.\n\n You can put it on if you got a mineral build up from well water, put the vinegar on there, and it'll dissolve it readily.\n\n\r\nIf you put vinegar and honey on there, it'll dissolve it even into a little cream or almost make a cream substance out, less likely to drop off and crystallize.\n\n That's why I suggest that if you're going to use vinegar, you put it with, coconut cream or vegetable juice that has some fats in it.\n\n\r\nSo, when it dissolves it it won't break off in chunks and cause an aneurysm in your brain or somewhere else.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Killing Cancer Cells \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, my question is mangosteen has been recommended as a tumor killer\n\n What are your thoughts on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRemember that a cancer cell is going to die when it's time to die?\n\n If you kill it early and you get rid of your cancer cells, what happens if you build a tumor with no cancer cells around to dissolve the dead cells.\n\n\r\nIt's my philosophy and my experience that you let the body dissolve the tumor when  the body is ready?\n\n As long as you're feeding it properly, the body's going to do it at the time it's supposed.\n\n \r\nRemember, that fluid that's in a cancer cell is the same kind of property as a virus.\n\n It is not alive, the fluid is not alive.\n\n\r\nIt's not a live serum like the blood, it is a solvent.\n\n It is a protein structure that disassembles tissue.\n\n So, it starts dissolving all the dead cells around and your body knows the timing, and if you do it too soon and you get some tumors later, where are your cancer cells gonna come from.\n\n You have a limited number of cancer cells?\n\n\r\nEverybody has cancer.\n\n Everybody has cancer.\n\n It's just that when you have a concentration of a certain number of cancer cells is when the pharmaceutical says industry says, \"Okay, we've gotta treat you because now you've got a damaging cancer\", and then they'll make $80,000 every treatment.\n\n And that's what it's all about.\n\n\r\nThey want you to use their chemotherapy, their radiation machines.\n\n Anything that makes them money, has nothing to do with fact and health.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what about the mangosteen in general.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe mangosteen has the ability to be solvent reactive, but it just doesn't isolate it self to cancer cell?\n\n\r\nSo, if you have weak cells throughout the body and you start dissolving other weak cells, let's say it's in your brain.\n\n You'll lose a lot of brain cells, you'll lose a lot of liver cells and that may be something you can't afford to do at any particular time.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Lymphatic System, Cancer \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFor someone who has lung tumor and inflammation in the lymphatic system, what would you recommend for the cleansing\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nInflammation of the lymphatic system is the cleansing.\n\n Remember your lymph system is the cleanser of the body.\n\n It cleans out all debris, all waste, all dead cells.\n\n It takes it into the system, either through the nodes or the glands.\n\n That's where it does the work.\n\n They'll set out serums like viruses, solvents to dissolve that tissue.\n\n Then they also utilize nutrients from the lacteal system to neutralize those compounds.\n\n Then it dumps it into connective system, then you perspire it out the skin, or it will dump it into the mucus membranes like in the intestinal tract to flush it out there.\n\n\r\nBut most of it goes out through the skin.\n\n You take hot baths every day, 35, 40 minutes a day.\n\n If you actually have lymphatic congestion, you look the book, We Want To Live under lymphatic congestion and do the lymphatic baths.\n\n \r\nAnd that's doing one to two baths a week that lasts an hour to an hour and a half.\n\n\r\nThere's a pineapple formula in there that you take for that particular kind of bath.\n\n Not for the short 35, 40 minute baths, but for the hour to an hour and a half bath, you need that pineapple, coconut formula in there to help move it.\n\n \r\nSo, your lymph system is doing its job, and remember your lymph system will contain more concentrations of cancer than anywhere else in the body.\n\n If you plug one of your lymph glands and you're over the age of 38 years old, 80% of the time, you're gonna be diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and you don't have lymphatic cancer.\n\n Your lymph glands are doing a job.\n\n \r\nIf you've got a lymph gland or node that is hard as rock, you've got cancer in that gland.\n\n If it's as hard as rubber, it is not cancer.\n\n If it's movable, it is not cancer.\n\n It's doing its job.\n\n It's dissolving cancer cells from somewhere else in the body and all these women get these lumpectomies and they're risking their lives because if they don't have the lymphs to break down all of that dead tissue in the cancer cells, they're gonna grow tumors like crazy.\n\n \r\nSo, all these women getting mastectomies and lumpectomies are just ensuring that they're gonna get cancer in their life and they're gonna die from it because they have no way of cleansing.\n\n Hmm.\n\n No lymph system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan coffee enemas actually aggravate.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, coffee enemas will cause cancer?\n\n Three, four years, five years down the line, unless you keep doing them for the rest of your life, then you poison the body to the point where it says, Hey, screw it.\n\n Then when you get old, you're gonna be one of those people that walks around with few cells alive because you contain all the dead cells in the body and they can't be dissolved out of the system.\n\n\r\nSo, it's all depends on what kind of a life you want.\n\n So, you can make your choices.\n\n So, you can do  coffee enemas and end up an old person like that, a stiff robot with very little functionality at all.\n\n Or you can not do them and let the lymph system eat properly, let the lymph system do its job, but anybody who has cancer needs to get very fat, that's very important to dissolve and feed that lymphatic system.\n\n\r\nYo not dissolve the lymphatic system, for the lymphatic system to get the fats that they need to dissolve the dead cells.\n\n So, any patient of mine who has cancer, if they don't get fat, I know they're not going to last.\n\n 9/10 people who've died and only 5% die utilizing this diet with cancer, only 5% die.\n\n\r\n9/10 of those would not gain the weight.\n\n They'd stay thin like you, they didn't make it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Magnetic Touch, Aajonus Likes To Be Touched \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm looking at massage, but basically reflexology\n\n I've read certain things that you said that I've also listened to.\n\n I guess the last time you were talking about getting coconut oil massages massages that you're getting from people in Thailand.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'm not into Thai massage.\n\n I tell them how I want a massage done and it's always gentle.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n I got that from your report, for sure.\n\n \r\nI know you don't want the lacerations or whatever, the excessive manipulation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt causes terrible bruising, and damage in the body.\n\n Just remember that a therapy called magnetic touch.\n\n All they're doing is touching a few points at the same time.\n\n They'll pick one particular point and they'll hit those points.\n\n And I had them experiment with me for a three day period, cuz I couldn't believe the changes that were going on in the way it made me feel just by hitting those certain points.\n\n\r\nIt's called magnetic touch and their center is in Phoenix, Arizona, and they have a video you can watch.\n\n That was probably the most effective that I've seen, but when I can get it, I like to be touched because I'm so mental.\n\n Everything I do is in the mental plane.\n\n I don't get to act anymore.\n\n I don't get to paint anymore.\n\n\r\nSo, I like sensuality.\n\n So, just for the sheer enjoyment of being touched, I like to be massaged very gently and lightly with coconut cream.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut just as far as reflexology itself, that particular science.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes.\n\n But reflexology is fine, but not the digging in the reflexology does.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut then as far as just like the points themselves, they're fine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, touch them?\n\n Barely massage the area, that does all the electrical stimulation, brings the blood in, but let's say you have what they call a bone spur or a crystal in a particular area and you go in and break it.\n\n You're going to be lacerating and cutting up tissue.\n\n Just need some vinegar, vinegar in your feet, massaging in your feet with a little coconut cream.\n\n Drink some vinegar, little small amounts to start breaking up those crystals, the way to do it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThat would work for a cow as well.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, absolutely?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about Dosha massage.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't know Dosha?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhere they go in and they start with their hands closed and they press, and they wait til your muscle relaxes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt depends on how much pressure they put on, it could cut off circulation.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou're barely being touched.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's good.\n\n Anything that's soft and light is nice.\n\n\r\nRaw apple cider vinegar, yeah.\n\n Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.\n\n**[Fred]**\n\r\nWhat about in reflexology a certain point in the foot equals a certain part in the body.\n\n\r\nDo you think that's valid?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you've got nerves running all through that can stimulate the nerves all the way through that point?\n\n So, definitely.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Meals Is From Processing Meats \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nMeasles are a little bit more\n\n Measles started coming in heavily, especially after processing toxic old meats.\n\n Like from sausage, hot dogs, stuff like that.\n\n That's mainly from that.\n\n \r\nThey used to use a citric acid, other times in history they use formaldehyde, and when you put that kind of substance, those kind of chemicals in luncheon meats, it'll cause a measles type detoxification eventually in your population.\n\n Your kids are trying to detoxify before the they enter puberty, because if they go into puberty with those toxins in there they won't reproduce.\n\n We've got that problem now, the rate of impotency is tremendous.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Milkshakes and Aajons Look Sinny But Hes Not \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, if you want some milkshake, but I want you eating eggs alone at night\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd milkshake would be.\n\n\r\nAajonus]\r\nMilkshake is milk,, honey and, eggs?\n\n What I tell people to do, so they're not eating too much food or if they very skinny and they need to gain a lot of weight.\n\n \r\nTo me, skinny is my size, but I'm not really skinny.\n\n I'm 21% body fat.\n\n And let's see, he's probably 22% body fat.\n\n He's only 1% more of than I.\n\n Why don't I look it.\n\n Why do I look like somebody, an athlete who has 10%?\n\n Because fat molecules, when they are raw are very tiny\r\nMolecules that have been cooked swell 10 to 50 times their normal size?\n\n I've been eating raw foods, no cooked fats since 1972.\n\n So, all of the fat in my body, takes 40 years, all of the fat in my body is new raw molecules, tiny.\n\n So, I'm fat, I just don't look it.\n\n \r\nAnd that's the way you get to be if you go on this diet.\n\n I've got women that have been on the diet 17, 18 years.\n\n They're 27% body fat, but they're slender.\n\n That's what all women dream of and you can have it on this diet.\n\n You just have to be patient.\n\n You know, it takes 12, 17 years.\n\n You'll never looked fat again, but yet you have all the fat to be calm and happy.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Mold On Concrete Or Wood Okay, How To Detox \n \n**[2007],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nGangrene helps dissolve animal tissue\n\n Yeasts helps dissolve the cells that have been damaged or highly built on sugar products.\n\n So, those yeast eat those particular kinds of cells.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat if you're a house has mold.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a dangerous mold?\n\n Well, if it's in stone, if it's mold in stone and it's in natural wood, that's fine.\n\n\r\nSo, molds in a house, like black mold that grows in building material.\n\n It is not natural.\n\n That's very toxic to the system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd then what do you take to detox that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's not an easy one?\n\n Berries, if you made a mixture of blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, even dark mulberries, a and coconut cream with lime juice and about 1/4 - 1/3 TSP of vinegar and that will help destroy molds.\n\n \r\nJust remember, a natural antibacterial, antifungal shouldn't be used too often, but what you can use it to destroy even toxic molds that get into the body is lime juice.\n\n Most of the time you get rid of toxic penicillin out of the body, cuz penicillin grows in the body and the penicillin is from grains and it belongs in the bird community, not the human community.\n\n \r\nWhen they sterilize it for injection, it damages the RNA and DNA to have it go into hibernation as it's supposed to.\n\n So, penicillin will always live in your body, always live actively.\n\n So, the only way you can destroy it is by mixing a particular ratio of these ingredients, but it depends upon your body, weight and size.\n\n\r\nIf you're about 100 pounds, you could have 3 tablespoons, each of lime juice, coconut cream and honey, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.\n\n If you are 150 pounds, could be 4 - 4.\n\n5 tablespoons of coconut cream, lime juice and honey, and about 1.\n\n5 teaspoons of lemon juice.\n\n\r\nAnyway, you mix that together, blend it together and then you pour it into- depending upon your size.\n\n If it's a small amount of a ratio of three of each, 3 tablespoons of each.\n\n For 3 tablespoons, you use about 2 ounces of naturally sparkling mineral water.\n\n  if you're using 4.\n\n5 tablespoons of each, you'd use 2.\n\n5 - 3 ounces of naturally sparkling water.\n\n \r\nYou pour that ingredients into the water, not the water into the ingredients.\n\n Chemically that's very important.\n\n It will foam up like a float.\n\n It's delicious, but do not suck it down.\n\n Drink it slowly, otherwise it's gonna rush into the kidneys and the bladder, and you need it to permeate to the intestines and into the brain.\n\n Most of it lives in the intestines and brain.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Never Go To The Dentist \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSome people build a lot of plaque\n\n If you don't build a lot of plaque, you don't need vinegar very often.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when should people go to the dentist for a cleaning then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNever go to a dentist for a cleaning?\n\n Not necessary if you use that formula.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan you do it with a water pick, you said a tooth brush before.\n\n\r\nWhat about a water pick with that stuff?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you got the the clay up in there and you want to wash it out and you're afraid it's not coming out on its own, use a water pick to flush it out, but let it do its work for at least 12 hours?\n\n Good clay.\n\n \r\nYou've got clay, the vinegar and the coconut cream together mixture.\n\n Dip your toothbrush in there and just go to town.\n\n As you're brushing, the clay will move up into the gum and then it carries with it the coconut cream and vinegar, which dissolves the plaque.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Not Too Much Hoeny With Cheese \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question, Barbara\n\n**[Barbara]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I'm pretty sure I missed something earlier when you said mineral supplement of cheese and honey, you don't want too much honey because, I missed that part of it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause it will cause a fractionation of the ionization groups.\n\n\r\nLike you may have 5 molecules or 6 molecules of calcium with about 3 or 4 molecules of magnesium, 1 of phosphorus, 2 of potassium.\n\n Now that's the normal collective unit that is a balance.\n\n\r\nToo much honey causes a fractionation of that and they may not be utilized for feeding the cells properly, and when you put the cheese, that is used to nutrify the body, not to use as a detoxifier and not to cause mineral imbalances.\n\n So, it has to be a small amount of honey.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Olive Oil and Beets, Bone Marrow ,sperm \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo you have a question, Jim\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nFor a month or so, everything's been blurry for this eye and I kind of worked at it by focusing at different distances, and that seems to improve a little bit?\n\n In the book you talk about more olive oil and I think beets or something like that if I remember right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTogether?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nPut it in the juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, maybe make your juice 10% beet juice and put about a teaspoon and a half of olive of oil in it?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n That won't have repercussions in any other way.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, not at that concentration?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nAnd is there anything that you put on the eyelid or anything like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou can put bone marrow, sperm?\n\n Now, when you use sperm, because sperm are very, very strong- ovum, you can use ovum, but there's no way to harvest ovum.\n\n And if you women got any ideas, let me know, cuz that's high in stem cells also, but the sperm will go right into the lid and cause burning in the eye, so you might wanna to let it dry a little bit and deaden and just a little, so the stem cells are active and not the sperm itself.\n\n \r\nThe bone narrow stinks a little bit, so you have stinky eye lids.\n\n If you're making out with somebody, they have to smell.\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nCan't you just wash it off.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, you don't wash it off?\n\n Just leave it there.\n\n I mean, it's just barely moisturized with it and you rub it in.\n\n\r\nI'm not talking about putting sperm or bone marrow on your skin to the point where it gets dry and you see it.\n\n It's gotta be so thin, barely wet it and put it in.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nButter?\n\n In my experiments with that over a 10 year period it caused a lot of burning in the eyes, constant burning all day long.\n\n The butter's a very acidic fat and in the eyes it causes constant irritation.\n\n So, butter's not that great.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nI put butter every day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's some people, depends upon their condition.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's butter in your face cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but that's mixed with other things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Only Go After Spinal, Esophaus and Lung Caner \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I don't think that anybody should aggressively go after any kind of tumor, unless it's esophageal cancer or it's lung cancer or it's spinal cancer\n\n \r\n[Attende\r\nAnd why is that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause when you have 'em on the spine, if you block the spinal cord, then you cut the connection off for the rest of the body?\n\n\r\nIf you don't mind being a paraplegic, that's fine, but if you don't want to be a paraplegic, it's like, okay, do I wanna live as a paraplegic or do I want to be aggressive and take a chance on dying sooner.\n\n It's a gamble and on your case, I'd have to see your x-rays before I'd make that decision?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Osteoporosis From Vinegar \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIn terms of the osteoporosis and the vinegar, how how much should you be careful about ingesting before\n\n Because I already have osteoporosis, because I've been doing the vinegar a lot of?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's not a good idea to have any more than, let's say a half a teaspoon of vinegar a day and have it in a vegetable juice.\n\n It's a good carrier for it for the arteries and veins to break up the plaque.\n\n If you put it in milk, not likely to get into the glands and organs, and if you have a build up there or you have kidney stones or bladder stones, then the vinegar and milk is a good vehicle that a good combination to get to the kidneys and bladder.\n\n\r\nOf course, the vinegar carried in juice will get to the kidney and bladder too if you have stones to break them up.\n\n \r\nIf you have a stone like I had that grew since I was three years old, and that was concentrated from mercury from tetanus shots and other vaccines when I was an infant, it made a solid steel ball in the center of a stone that was this long, and this wide.\n\n The longest one that all of these urologists had ever seen, of course it had grown for 54 years.\n\n So, it was huge.\n\n That's not going to dissolve with vinegar.\n\n \r\nWhat the urologist said, he said, \"I can dissolve that in 20 minutes\".\n\n It took him an hour and 40 minutes because it was solid metal inside, mainly mercury.\n\n And I had to deal with those poisons that were dispersed throughout my body for a couple of years.\n\n \r\nSo, now if you have that kind of a stone, it's been a very long, long time developing and it's concentrated mercury, it's not likely that vinegar's going to work for that.\n\n But your common stones that are formed from cooked foods that you've eaten, whether it's you ate the cooked foods.\n\n 40, 50, 60 years ago, when you're detoxifying and they collect and they bind together, they can actually grow like a normal crystal.\n\n They can get larger and larger.\n\n So, vinegar helps prevent that kind of thing, but no more than a half a teaspoon a day.\n\n For some people who've been on a raw diet for a very long time, no more than a quarter or teaspoon a day.\n\n\r\nRaw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Parkinsons, White Meat With Lube Formula \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nParkinson's is a disease of dryness of the nerves\n\n It's like a mild version of Ms.\n\n The lubrication formula is very important.\n\n \r\nLubrication formula, moisturizing formula; very important for resolving that.\n\n Your white meats, remember white is a category, not a color.\n\n So, any fish, any foul is good for that.\n\n Eating it with moisturizing formula, lubrication, formula.\n\n\r\nAlso, yoga slowly done is important to help rebuild and prevent Parkinson's from.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n well, the yoga and slowly done is to make sure that you're getting circulation and those areas are stretched to get into those nerves that are deeply rooted.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThai Chi also.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n That's fine.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey've done some studies about how it helps to contain it.\n\n \r\nAajonus]\r\nYeah, it will.\n\n It's just getting circulation into those areas, but the dryness prevents it.\n\n So, you can break up that dryness.\n\n In a lubrication formula, you could add a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar to help dissolve any crystals that might be in those passages.\n\n Because mineral build ups have some degree of influence in Parkinson's and, any kind of palsy.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Pig Mesh Hernia Surgery \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnyway, it's been seven days and he had anesthetic and a lot of antibiotics and all that\n\n And last night he was so dizzy, he thought maybe he was having a blood clot and I was gonna go to the ER.\n\n So, what can I give him to help the dizziness.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, the dizziness, her father just went through a hernia surgery, which means they put a mesh in there?\n\n\r\nNow there are several meshes, most of them are plastic and there's one pig skin mesh made of pig skin, of course, like cat gut with certain kinds of thread for sutures that there's only a few doctors in the United States that use the pig mesh.\n\n \r\nCause you have to understand, doctors are taught to be afraid of any animal tissue.\n\n It's the cause of all disease, animals are the cause of all disease on the planet.\n\n Anything that's a live organism is the cause of all of our ills on earth.\n\n It's absolute ridiculous, garbage, but they believe it because the pharmaceutical house tells them that that's the way it is and they totally buy it.\n\n\r\nSo, these are very smart people, but they're certainly not wise doctors.\n\n These are people who are good parrots, smart parrots.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Pineapple Only For Long Bath \n \n**[2008],[Fred]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAajonus, quick clarification\n\n Earlier you said you do the pineapple mixture only if you're doing the lymph or also for the regular baths.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, only for the long lymphatic baths?\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nAnd that doesn't have honey in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt doesn't need it?\n\n It's sweet already with the pineapple.\n\n You don't need the honey, but it's okay.\n\n You can use honey in that one if you want.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) Plaque On Bowel Is Imagination \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThis stuff about there's plaque on the entire bowel wall\n\n I don't know where that imagination has come from.\n\n It isn't like teeth get plaque, and that's how they describe it.\n\n Cuz every autopsy I've ever done on an animal and those that I've seen on humans, none of 'em like that.\n\n \r\nI mean, some of the intestinal walls are this thick in edema and toxicity, but there's no plaque, except in areas where there's severe scarring.\n\n And then there will be some plaque on the scarring, but normally plaquing does not really occur.\n\n That's a fictitious imagination of somebody who wants to scare the hell out of you.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Restaurants Get Best Meat \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRestaurants always get your best cuts and the best quality of meat\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThey shop at Costco restaurant, most restaurants.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, they don't.\n\n It would cost too much money.\n\n Some of your small family restaurants will buy from Costco, but not your good restaurants.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) Salt 2nd Worst Than Cooking \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSo, I've never had anybody that has not been satisfied unless they eat salt\n\n Salt demineralizes, destroys intestinal bacteria, cause all kinds of problems.\n\n Sure.\n\n It'll get rid of symptoms galore, but it does it just like an antibiotic.\n\n It is ruthless.\n\n The second worst thing to cooking is salt.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNot even sugar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, sugar's not as bad as salt?\n\n In the intestinal tract, the sugar doesn't necessarily break down, destroy bacteria as is easily as salt does.\n\n Because the salt dehydrates the bacteria, completely dries it up, sugar doesn't.\n\n The bacteria can avoid contact and absorption of the sugars.\n\n\r\nBut the villi in the intestines, when the sugar hits it, it eats away at them.\n\n So, of course, you've got 20 years of eating sugar, your villi are going to be reduced in size, dissolved.\n\n Acidly dissolved from sugar products by a quarter every 20 years.\n\n So, by the time you're 60 years old, you have very short Villa.\n\n\r\nAnd what is the Villa for.\n\n As the food passes through it registers what kind of food it is and what bacteria, and what digestive enzymes are necessary?\n\n So, as the Villa are moved, they send serum out through the, through their pores, and that's your digestive juices.\n\n In the stomach it's almost all hydrochloric acid, in the intestinal tract it's hydrochloric acid, it's numerous different types of even bile, but the most concentration of bile is in the duodenum.\n\n\r\nHowever, bile is secreted throughout the small intestine.\n\n in the bowel there's nothing secreted, except for E coli.\n\n It's an E coli environment.\n\n \r\nBut E.\n\n coli, isn't that the dangerous shit.\n\n *gasp*\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (52) Salt Water Flush and How To Rinse Your Nose \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou end up with more discharge, which is what you want\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's exactly what you want?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat about salt water flushes for your nose.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVery bad?\n\n Dries out and causes the loss of vitamin K and U, causes bleeding, nose bleeds.\n\n \r\nFlushing your nose will cause nose bleeds, the salt.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow about coconut cream.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it's okay?\n\n It's gonna burn a little bit.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that good or bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe best thing to do is let some water sit until it gets green and algaes growing in the jar and then rinse with that kind of water?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSay that again.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou let water sit in a jar until it starts turning algae, algaeic?\n\n\r\nIt could take months to do that, but if you got a jar of it, then you can just flush it sometimes.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLike a pond in the backyard that's got algae in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere you go?\n\n You can go snort that.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhy do you do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe microbes in it, it's got sea monkeys, and they're very good for healing and sealing the mucus membranes?\n\n \r\nThe algae also will help break down and eat any toxic mineral in the water and break it down to a non-caustic substance.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nYou didn't tell me that before.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou never told me you were snorting with salt water.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nBut a doctor told me to.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you wanna know about health, do you go to the guy flipping hamburgers at McDonald's and find out how you're rich or do you go to Donald Trump.\n\n Do you wanna know something about health?\n\n You don't go to a doctor?\n\n They know nothing about health.\n\n Doctors know disease and drugs.\n\n Period.\n\n That's all they know.\n\n\r\nThey know nothing about health.\n\n They do not study health.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou said it helps break down.\n\n What was the word you said?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny toxic minerals that are in the water?\n\n They'll dry out the sinuses.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Sinus Infection, More Mucus Good \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI wanted to ask about sinus infections cuz I've looked at the book and there's all kinds of stuff that I sort of flew together to try and deal with it, but it's from colds and this and that, and I wonder if there's anything specific that you have\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAre you having a sinus infection or are you having a detox from the brain.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, that's what I think it is?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf it's bleeding out the nose.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n It's not bleeding.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo.\n\n Then you're detoxing from the brain, and you need a lot of mucus, a lot of milkshakes.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, which of course makes it worse because-\r\n\n\r\nNo, it doesn't make it worse.\n\n\r\nIf you're bleeding, you've gotta sinus infection.\n\n .\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, I see, but I mean, the milkshakes causes more mucus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNow, it doesn't cause mucus, your body will build mucus with it, if it needs it.\n\n \r\nI drink milkshakes all the time and I have very little mucus because I don't need it, but there are times when I need it, and then I drink the milkshakes when I need it,and it does build the mucus.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Skin Cancer, Bone Marrow, Sperm \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIs there anything else you can recommend to treat skin cancer\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what I've been experimenting with over the last two years is using bone marrow, which has a lot of stem cells that helps regrow healthy tissue, but it won't grow cancer cells to allow dead cells to collect?\n\n \r\nAnd remember, I said in my book, cancer's nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve dead cells and collects them in little stations, whether it's a wart, which is a benign tumor or a cancerous carcinoma of the skin where you've got cancer cells on there drawing more and more dead cells to the area.\n\n \r\nNow a cancer cell is not a bad guy.\n\n It's a very beneficial cell that draws lots of dead cells around it.\n\n The cancer cell, when it dies, it sets out a serum.\n\n It's like a virus, it's a solvent that dissolves all the dead cells that it's called out into that station.\n\n So, that's why malignant tumors can dissolve in overnight or in days.\n\n\r\nA benign tumor, there's no circulation to it.\n\n There are no cancer cells in there that has that solvent virus type agent in it.\n\n So, a benign tumor can take forever to dissolve and get rid of.\n\n \r\nSo, cancer is what I like.\n\n So, cancer cells are good guys to get rid of it.\n\n \r\nAlso, sperm is a good way to get rid of it because it has a concentrated amount of stem cells.\n\n So, putting sperm on any kind of a cancer or any kind of a sore.\n\n I mean, I've got people using sperm to get rid of wrinkles and it gets rid of them very quickly.\n\n Because what it does is it helps the healthy cells grow and allow the dead cells, which are just bricks in the wall to fall off.\n\n\r\nI'm not vain enough to do it all the time, but I do it once in a while.\n\n**[Attendees],[Attendee]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\nSo, bone marrow is topical.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTopical, yes?\n\n Well, you can use it internally too.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Supplements \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYeah, he went for that treatment, but that's only because it was taking over his face again\n\n But when I had that tissue analyzed, it was all concentrations of mineral supplements and vitamins.\n\n I'm telling you, they're chemical, just like anything else.\n\n The only place you can get food vitamins is from food.\n\n\r\nThink about it people ,you have to use your head.\n\n This is a money producing industry.\n\n They want your money.\n\n If they took vitamins from food, how many vitamin E are they going get out of a whole ear corn.\n\n To fit a couple capsules?\n\n\r\nDo you think they're gonna produce hundreds and thousands of acres of corn or soybeans to get a few vitamin E capsules, they would cost you thousands of dollars.\n\n Each capsule could cost you $200, $300, $400.\n\n These people are using chemistry.\n\n \r\nSure.\n\n You've got a good guy with a good mind.\n\n People who want good things, they go to a chemistry lab, say, this is what I want, and the chemistry lab tells them, \"Oh, we can do that\".\n\n And they're lying through their teeth, you can't do it.\n\n Cause that chemistry lab is gonna go to a food manufacturer and say, \"I need your waste product, so I can use a chemical extraction and get a certain nutrient out of that food\".\n\n \r\nThat food's already been chemically.\n\n It's already been heat processed.\n\n It's not food anymore, it's a chemical laboratory.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nFish oil!\r\n\n\r\nFish oil, still the FDA doesn't allow fish oil, unless it's treated.\n\n Chemically or heat treated and both usually.\n\n Can't do it.\n\n\r\nYou want fish oil, you eat fish, and then you utilize it better anyway.\n\n If you're looking at supplements like butter X, that's different.\n\n You got a fermentation process that cuts off this really refined fat from a cruder fat, that's like making butter from cream.\n\n\r\nIt is a process, but it's still a food.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that the butter oil from the Western price foundation.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) Synethic Vitamins \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAlmost all the foods out there in a grocery store have no nutrients in them\n\n And when you see nutrients added to it, vitamins; remember those vitamins are not natural.\n\n Those are all chemical.\n\n So, you're really not getting any biological nutrient in there, complete form.\n\n \r\nThe food industry loves that because you eat all the time, you'll never be satisfied.\n\n The only drawback to that is some people get nauseous from it because they don't digest properly, and a lot of the toxins causes them to lose their appetite, but most people are never satisfied, so they're constantly eating and they overeat.\n\n \r\nThe food companies love that.\n\n Absolutely love it.\n\n So, the more they can denature the food and make you eat more of it, they will do it.\n\n So, when you're on a raw diet and you're getting plenty of the proper nutrients and a balanced diet like I organized it on page 40 and 41 of the recipe book.\n\n If you follow that kind of pattern, for most people that will work and you'll never be hungry, you'll never have those cravings that are blown out after about the first 30 days.\n\n Once your body gets enough nutrients, it will say, oh my God, finally, you know, I'm not hungry all the time.\n\n I feel satisfied with my food.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (57) Tapeworms For Constipation \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIf you wanna resolve a problem, it's good to get a tapeworm or something like that\n\n I had constipation from the age of 3 years old or probably 18 months after that tetanus shot that made me autistic, and up until almost 4 years ago, I did an experiment fermenting milk with some maca powder.\n\n Which is a root from South America that has a lot of flavor and taste like Cheerios.\n\n And I was gonna do it to help detoxify all the cereals that I lived on as a teenager and child and donuts.\n\n So, I fermented it over a little bit longer than I should have.\n\n It was so fermented than when I popped the top off the bottle, the alcohol actually burned my sinuses and my eyes were red and tearing for almost 24 hours, but I had 3 cups at a time which was stupid.\n\n In a day I should have taken like 1/4 cup a day or something like that.\n\n In 24 hour period, I did 3 cups.\n\n\r\nSo, if it caused me to have a tapeworm.\n\n And the tapeworms do not live on intestinal tissue.\n\n They eat the food, excess sugars, they eat sugars.\n\n Only creatures in the world that get tapeworms are those that are fed cereals.\n\n That's why all the African children that get tapeworms are because when they get the help packages.\n\n \r\nThese people who help feed these people are making deals with General Foods and Purina for the worst discarded cereals, so they can feed a lot of people and it's not about quality, it's about the amount that they can feed these people.\n\n\r\nSo, they give them powdered milk and we know by Pottenger's work with the powdered milk, it created the worst diseases and the most violence in the animals, in the cats.\n\n So, they feed them this powdered milk with water in this cereal, this waste cereal that they can't even sell in this country.\n\n So, they give it to these children and then they get tapeworms cuz the tapeworms eat excess sugar to keep the intestines from dissolving.\n\n\r\nAnd we're told the tapeworm will eat all the protein.\n\n No it doesn't eat the protein.\n\n He eats only high carbohydrate foods that get into the intestinal tract.\n\n \r\nSo, I had this tapeworm going to town in me and I was so happy, my first parasite.\n\n I've been trying to eat parasites for 36 years and I wasn't able to get a parasite.\n\n So, this is my first parasite, because of chemotherapy and radiation I was too toxic to breed and maintain parasites in my body.\n\n \r\nSo, I got my first parasite, about 5, 6 days later, I get this craving for onion.\n\n So, I sat down, who sits down and eats a half of an onion, just sits and eats it.\n\n I can't even take much of onion in my food, but I sat down and ate a half an onion.\n\n Within six hours, I shat out 48 feet of a tapeworm and I happened to be in a hotel in Hanoi and it was all hardwood floors.\n\n I was paying $12 for a hotel room that was all wood, all wood furniture.\n\n Excellent quality, $12.\n\n The ceiling was wood Parque and floor was real teak wood Parque, $12 a night.\n\n \r\nSo, I had to get this thing out of the toilet cause I wanted to measure it, see how long it was.\n\n A tapeworm's sections will shrivel up like a rice in about six hours, a tapeworm noodle will just look like a rice.\n\n Harvested dry, hard rice.\n\n So, I had to get it spread out quickly to measure it.\n\n So, I'm putting it gently along the floor.\n\n It took me about probably 20 minutes, so I knew it shrunk a few feet at that point, but I had about 47 feet of tapeworm, which probably about 50 feet.\n\n So, I was all upset with myself because it came out with the onion, just shot out with the onion.\n\n So, I was all upset and then about eight weeks later and I had diarrhea, not a lot of diarrhea, but when I had the movement every day, it was diarrhea.\n\n So, it wasn't annoying.\n\n I didn't have to run to a toilet all the time, when I had it once a day, it was diarrhea.\n\n I guess it was about six weeks later, I noticed a noodle in the toilet again, and it's floating like a stingray, and that's again, a section of a tapeworm.\n\n\r\nSo, I thought, oh my God, you see, he lives, he lives in me, doing work.\n\n And then I had him for about six weeks.\n\n I'd see segments every time I had a bowel movement, I've never been constipated since.\n\n Even on a raw diet, I was constipated with the first part of the fecal matter.\n\n \r\nWhen I was a child, I went every three to five days.\n\n So, when it came out, it came out as big as my fist and as hard as granite and felt like granite, was just sharp and it ripped my rectum.\n\n So, by the time I was 21 years old, 22 went onto the raw diet.\n\n My rectum was an inch thick with fibroids, scar tissue, from ripping.\n\n And it would rip, I bled every time I went to the bathroom, every time I had a bowel movement and it continued on this diet.\n\n I could have 5, 6 bowel movements a day, but the first one in the day, the first part of it was hard as granite again, always.\n\n\r\nWhen I had that tapeworm, ever since the tapeworm, everything is smooth.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Teeth Throbbing and Sensitive and Root Canal \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRegarding of some teeth of mine\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's trying to clean out the circulation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd when I brush the sides of the teeth it's sensitive, and I really don't want to go for cleaning.\n\n I dread it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDon't.\n\n Just use the vinegar, the coconut cream and clay, and that'll clean them.\n\n Also, eat cheese regularly, every hour, little piece of cheese.\n\n That will make sure that you're using the minerals from the cheese to bind with the poison, and you're not using the minerals in the food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, should I wait to go to the dentist for the cleaning because.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, I wouldn't go for a cleaning?\n\n You just use your vinegar.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWell, every six months I go for a cleaning.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot necessary if you're using the vinegar, clay and coconut cream.\n\n It gets a deep down in.\n\n Like I said, the clay carries the coconut cream and the vinegar deep into the gums and it dissolves the plaque, so you don't have to have some metal instrument going there and cutting and ripping your gums apart.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow often to do that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDo it every day if you want?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nInstead of toothpaste.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, that is toothpaste?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Tetracycline, Biopics Teeth Wont Whiten \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnybody who's had heavy tetracycline or alike antibiotics, and wants to have their teeth whitened, you can forget it about it because the molds grow into the nerve and it's outward, that's what these teeth\n\n These are tetracycline damaged and they're too small to have them capped, so I'll just have to live with my dark teeth.\n\n\r\nThere's no way cuz it's in the nerve and the nerves dump the toxins.\n\n Cuz molds eat metals, so they break them down into a finer substance, a finer molecule, so when it leaves the nerves and gets into the tubules and the tubules feed the dentine, it turns the whole tooth colored.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) Thalium \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBut she never gained as much weight, she was still 10 pounds under\n\n I wanted her to gain 10 more pounds and she wouldn't do it.\n\n And this girl, Kimberly at the end, she was vomiting like crazy, like said not as bad as Owanza, but you know, 7 times a day, 8 times a day, and after two and a half months, I had to figure out what she was vomiting.\n\n So, I took 4-ounces of her vomit and sent it to a laboratory, and the laboratory called me and said, \"Somebody's poisoning your patient\".\n\n And I said, \"What do you mean\".\n\n He said, \"She has 3000 times the lethal dose of thallium in that four ounces of vomit\"?\n\n\r\nAnd I said, \"Nobody's poisoning her.\n\n She was a metal jeweler She made silver jewelry, and burned it right over the Bunsen burner, never wore a mask or gloves, so she inhaled all that thallium.\n\n Thallium is a mineral that's almost as toxic as mercury and almost as soft as lead, and it's highly toxic.\n\n Not quite as bad as mercury, but nearly.\n\n\r\nSo, she was just at the end, the tumors stopped forming, everything.\n\n She didn't have enough weight, she couldn't eat for the last two and a half weeks.\n\n She died because she couldn't eat.\n\n If she had just had 10 more fricking pounds, like I tried to get her to do for two years, she would've made it through that crisis.\n\n\r\nAnd that's why I say, if you got a serious problem, you need to be overweight because when you go through that detoxification process, if it's an intense one, you are not likely to make it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Tiredness Is From Losing Nutrietns and Longer Awake More You Detox \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnytime you get tired, the body's losing its nutrients on activity, on lactic acid and stuff like that\n\n It's time to take a nap, and just reduce.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI feel it on those two teeth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you've got toxicity there, so that's part of cleansing.\n\n Just remember the more you stay awake, the more you're gonna detoxify.\n\n\r\n90% of healing happens in the sleep state.\n\n So, if you're not sleeping, you're not healing.\n\n You're gonna be detoxing constantly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOn this diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny diet?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nSo, what is it when your gums bleed.\n\n What is that?\n\n Is that the same?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's the heavy metals passing down and preventing blood clotting using up the K and U?\n\n So you can eat some green cabbage juice.\n\n That'll give you enough vitamin K to clot, but that's heavy metals leaving the brain: mercury, lead Thallium from the brain, even aluminum prevents healing.\n\n\r\nSo, it causes bleeding.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Tomatoes To Detox Prostate \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow do you detox the prostate\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, tomatoes are an excellent way to detox the prostate?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIsn't at the lowest point in a man's body, so a lot of stuff collects down there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, it's a muscle?\n\n It's a muscle with a very low fat level.\n\n It's got the concentration of protein that the heart does because it's like a heart.\n\n The object of the prostate gland is to eject the sperm.\n\n That's the only job of the prostate, it's to eject sperm.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhat is this high PSA.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPSA is garbage regulation?\n\n It's another measurement where the pharmaceutical industry says, \"Okay, doctors, if you got a PSA count, treat these people for prostate cancer\".\n\n\r\nIf PSA had anything to do with prostate cancer.\n\n When you have a prostate removed, the PSA count should disappear, and my patients have come to me with prostate cancer and then had the prostates removed.\n\n I've seen the PSA up to 86 and then they had prostate.\n\n Why do they have a PSA count.\n\n\r\nDoctors say, \"Oh, well, they start producing in other areas of the body\"?\n\n That's absolutely bullshit.\n\n Again, it's the pharmaceutical industry making a fortune because all men will have prostate problems on a bad diet sometime later in their life.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nWhy does that push it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe PSA has nothing to do with prostate health, nothing to do with prostate health?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're right.\n\n I worked on that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou worked on that test.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n I worked on that test and Jim Marco developed it.\n\n It's all market.\n\n I was working there two years to sell it to the industry that that was a marker.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThis is a biochemist.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNo, I'm a medical engineer.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMedical engineer.\n\n Well, you know, medical engineer who knows biochemistry.\n\n \r\nSo, he worked on that test for PSA, it is garbage science.\n\n Again, the pharmaceutical industry to get every male and one out of three males has prostate problems in their lifetime.\n\n And look at the therapy.\n\n How much does it cost.\n\n You gotta go through prostate removal, if you're getting radiation therapy or chemotherapy for prostate cancer, hundreds of thousands of dollars?\n\n It's a big money issue again, it's marketing, just like you said, it's marketing.\n\n\r\nYou eat tomatoes.\n\n Tomatoes are great for getting rid of prostate cancer.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it has to be strained the way you say in the book.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDoesn't have to be strained?\n\n Usually people who have a prostate problem have polyps in the bowels.\n\n\r\nI find that they you go hand in hand about 80% of the time, and sometimes those seeds in the tomato could cause some polyps problems.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo it's good to filter those out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n Filter or juice it.\n\n Blueberries, and coconut cream are great for prostate.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nTogether.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, together?\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nProstate gland produces seminal fluid for the sperm to slide on, not producing the sperm.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's a muscle.\n\n It's not a gland.\n\n Really.\n\n They call it prostate gland and it does have fluid, but it isn't like the bursas, which create a fluid to keep lubrication in there.\n\n It's mainly a muscle.\n\n\r\nThere are areas where it creates that fluid, but it's mainly a fluid for itself.\n\n Like fat deposits on the top of a heart, that creates a fluid too.\n\n So, that part of the heart can be called a gland because it creates a fluid, which is like bursa fluid, which lubricates the muscles and keeps them from going into lockdown or charlie horse.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Urinary Tract Infection \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat is a urinary track infection\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnywhere are damaged cells, either damaged from the chemicals that you're eating or in your environment?\n\n So, if they're in the urethra or in the kidney or in the bladder, you've got a urinary tract infection.\n\n If those cells are damaged, your body will use either bacteria, parasites, or fungus if you're lucky.\n\n If you're unlucky and they're so toxic that the fungus, the bacteria, or the parasites can't eat it, then you have to use a viral infection to clean it.\n\n\r\nSo, it's always a cleansing.\n\n When you stop doing the things that irritate and damage the urinary tract, you'll stop having infections.\n\n Of course, a lot of poisons get dumped into the urinary tract, so those can cause damage if you don't have a good enough fat in those cells in the walls of your urethrae, kidneys and bladder are not solid and protected, they can be damaged.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, I started changing my diet, and I noticed that I started getting urinary infections, but I changed my diet to eating more fat, raw fats, I wouldn't have created that infection.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, that won't have created, your body will have you say, \"Oh, I've got the fats now, let's get rid of this garbage\"?\n\n And then all of a sudden you've got this stuff leaving to urinary tract and you've got dead cells leaving, they have to get dissolved and separated from the tissue there.\n\n They don't just fall off on their own.\n\n So, it's gotta go in there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI've never got a urinary tract infection my life.\n\n This is the first time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCongratulations.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI didn't know what it was.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's a cleansing, but you're still pretty thin.\n\n I don't know how much fat are in your urinary tract walls.\n\n It's a difficult place to feed.\n\n So, anybody who has a urinary tract infection, skin problems, you have to eat the moisturizing, lubrication formula.\n\n\r\nI love telling this story.\n\n It's two names because women love moisturizing, men love lubrication.\n\n So, I call it two things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Used To Be Vegan Water Weight \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI've only been following this- I used to be vegan before, and I just found myself getting unhealthy\n\n I went raw vegan for awhile and got more unhealthy, and then that's how I got here.\n\n So, I've been doing this diet for maybe three months and I noticed that I have gotten kind of puffy, just kind of rounded out, and I actually still have the same % body fat.\n\n I've actually gained like a lot of.\n\n weight, even though my body fat's not really going up that much, maybe 1%.\n\n They're very dense, but puffy at the same time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf you are only 12% body fat, probably 40% of your excess weight is water.\n\n\r\nSo, you don't have a fat problem.\n\n If you're 12%, you've got a fat deficiency problem.\n\n You've got a water retention problem.\n\n You need to stay away from water like the plague.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nReally.\n\n Cause I did that when I first read your book, but I noticed I was so thirsty all the time and I'm scared to drink so much milk cause I'd get really fat?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you sip it.\n\n See the problem is everybody gulps.\n\n You see me when I'm taking it, you don't see me going glug, glug, glug.\n\n You see me keeping my lips together and drawing out like I'm suckling a nipple and draw the milk through.\n\n So, I drink very little milk compared to somebody who gulps it and glugs it.\n\n It makes a difference in how you utilize it, and you will bloat because your body needs that milk to help go in there and change the circumstance if you were vegetarian.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Vegetable Oisl Crystalize \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou are very fat deficient because vegetable oils crystallize in the human body, they dehydrate in the human body\n\n They do not stay fluid at the human body temperature.\n\n Herbivores have a body temperature 101° - 105°.\n\n Vegetable oils remain solvent and soluble at those temperatures, but in 98.\n\n6° and lower it does not.\n\n It crystalizes and hardens.\n\n\r\nSo, you've got a lot of crystallized fat in your body from being a vegetarian.\n\n Probably a lot of it was cooked, even worse.\n\n \r\nSo, you're gonna have a lot of bloating for a long time.\n\n Your body just has to rebuild itself completely, has to completely remodel itself.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you can do the diet and over time it will basically.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUhuh?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nThere's nothing in particular you recommend eating that will help the process.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUhuh?\n\n It's just time.\n\n That's all you do is wait for your body to do it.\n\n It's like, you want to build a mansion.\n\n You gonna do it overnight?\n\n No.\n\n It's stages with a lot of help and a lot of processes.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (66) Vegetables Are Bad To Eat \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat about putting a vinegar on your salad\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you can do that, but I don't eat salads?\n\n My vegetable juice is my salad.\n\n Just remember when you eat a salad, it's a whole celluloses.\n\n We don't have the digestive tract to break that down, so as the cellulose is passing through the digestive tract is going to be constantly secreting alkaline fluids.\n\n\r\nWhat is the environment for our intestines.\n\n It's an acid bacteria and acid enzyme environment and digestive juices?\n\n So, if you neutralize that you're not gonna digest your milk or your meats, and your eggs and that's basically the diet.\n\n \r\nSo, whole vegetables is not a good thing to eat.\n\n\r\nCucumber is different.\n\n It's not a vegetable, it's a bland fruit, and that cellulose in a cucumber is very different.\n\n There's a lot of collagen precursors in it.\n\n So, it will help the skin, it will make your skin a lot better, it'll help hydrate it properly, keep it soft and smooth and healthy.\n\n\r\nSo, what you can do if you have cucumber in your juice, you can blend into a puree, some of that cucumber, and then mix it with the rest of your vegetable juice, the vegetables that you do juice, you separate the pulp from the juice.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat do you think of salads.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a terrible thing?\n\n The cellulous molecule has to be broken down infinitely, and it can only, it can do that in a herbivores stomach, a ruminant animal, it takes 48 hours.\n\n Our food passes through in 24 hours.\n\n They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule.\n\n\r\nPlus they chew, they swallow, they regurgitate, chew, swallow.\n\n And I don't see anybody here doing that, having a bowel movement with the same food that they ate 48 hours later is 24 hours later.\n\n \r\nSo again, what it does is it will cause all that alkalinity because you've got the pulp.\n\n If you want example of that, even the good juicers like, a green star juicer or any of the green gold juicers.\n\n That removes a lot of pulp.\n\n And if you don't filter it, you're going to get still a lot of pulp in there, and if your bowel movement is green, that tells you how much cell is still passing through, and you may need to filter it some more if you're not digesting your meats and your dairy properly.\n\n\r\nSo, you may need to filter your vegetable juice further and get as much pulp out of as you can.\n\n Some people who have a very, very dark toxic intestinal tract can use that little bit of pulp, but preferable pulp would be coconut fiber pulp.\n\n So, when you juice the coconut you don't strain the coconut cream and there's always a little pulp in it.\n\n\r\nAnd I've asked James not to filter that at Rawsome, so that we do get some of that fiber and it helps clean the intestinal tract of that toxicity that is severely embedded in the intestinal walls.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Water Ph \n \n**[2008],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm told that the ideal pH for water is 7\n\n3, favoring alkalinity, and there's at least one machine out there that not only filters out the chemicals, but it keeps it at this ideal alkalinity and with all the bottles that he's tested, they don't meet his criteria for the ideal alkalinity.\n\n\r\nSo, the quick question is, is a good glass bottle of water preferable to any of the filtration machines out there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely?\n\n What water do you know that animals drink that's alkaline.\n\n Animals drink out of ponds with heavy algae, all of it's acidic?\n\n\r\nIf you have an alkaline environment, you're not gonna have any living thing in it, not many living things in it.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n\r\nSo, the quick answer is the natural waters that we get, they're not supposed to have that high of pH.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nExactly?\n\n You have your vegetable juices, which carries other vitamin and enzymes with those alkalizing substances, so they don't do damage.\n\n Not supposed to be drinking very much water anyway.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (68) Weight Loss \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDetoxification cycles of weight gain and weight loss, and I noticed for me the weight gain cycle's no problem, but the weight loss portion, change between the green juice and the meats meat and just back and forth, and then at the end of the day before you go to sleep you can have some milkshake or something\n\n\r\nBut I find that I just don't feel satiated from that combination.\n\n It is very hard to lose the weight like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNot supposed feel satiated.\n\n You're supposed to be hungry all the time, but the only reason I put that weight loss thing in there, I like people to gain the fat ideally for two and a half years and leave it on for two and a half years and then go on the weight loss.\n\n\r\nSee a lot of people are afraid of fat.\n\n They're absolutely paranoid of fat.\n\n So, if they see that every six months they can gain and lose and they're not getting huge then they don't worry about it.\n\n So, after a few times, a year goes by, they've done it twice, then they don't worry about gaining a lot of fat and holding it for a year or two.\n\n Then they don't worry about it anymore.\n\n\r\nCause then they know they can get rid of the fat if they will discipline themselves to do the weight loss.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, what do you recommend for people who are into body building and fitness and need to have a lower body fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nA low percent body fat is not good for weight lifting.\n\n You have to have a high amount of fat in the muscles to keep them from going into cramping and stiffness.\n\n I talked about that extensively, lactic acid building crystals and making lesions in the muscles.\n\n That's why a lot of body builders and weightlifters don't have a lot of flexibility cause it causes a scar tissue to build up in the muscle.\n\n So, you need lots of fat tissues.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long do you find that the weight loss cycle lasts for and how long would you have to do that for.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt all depends upon the individual?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI can gain three pounds in two days and cause I'm so small, it's very, you know, just right away, but the weight loss part.\n\n The satiation is not there.\n\n So, it's hard to really keep it up for days on end with the green juice and the meat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, what do is just do a day of regular eating and 3, 4, 5 days of the regular diet, just alternate.\n\n I meant it to be slow loss, cuz your body needs the fat or else it wouldn't be gaining it quickly.\n\n It wouldn't hold onto it.\n\n It needs it inside in the tissues.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (69) Weightlifitng, Lactic Acid \n \n**[2008],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDid you recommend weight resistance training\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of training you want, it's fine all long as you're on a good diet?\n\n There is a problem with some people, Lucky had a problem with his tendons and muscles shrinking up, so he is getting tight and stiff.\n\n That's a sign that you're not digesting your proteins properly.\n\n Also, is sign of collecting lactic acid in the muscles.\n\n So, it creates these crystallization.\n\n It shortens the tendon, shorten the muscles, cuz it lacerate them, causes scar tissue to form, and then you become very stiff.\n\n \r\nYou see those guys, they're big and Brawny and they can't move.\n\n That's that kind of crystallization that begins with the uric acid buildup and the crystallizations from that causing lesions cutting into it?\n\n So again, a little vinegar if you're heavy into any kind of physical activity.\n\n \r\nMake sure you break up that lactic acid with either whey, raw whey, not something you get in a regular health food store, cuz that's always pasteurized and treated, but it has to be a good raw whey or your vinegar.\n\n\r\nWhen you exercise, you have a lactic acid byproduct of utilizing your fuel as energy.\n\n If you are a weight trainer, a weight lifter, any kind of an athlete, you're gonna have a lot of lactic acid buildup and that's a high acidic mineral concentration, and when they collect, they collect into like little bitty, tiny, glass particles, and they can slice it.\n\n They stay in the muscle if you don't dissolve them.\n\n So, you have to make sure they're dissolved, and the lactic acid doesn't build up or else you're going to get stiff and scar.\n\n Remember the stiffness is scarring of those muscles and tendons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow much whey would you recommend and is that before or after the workout.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's either way, either before or after?\n\n Because it's not going to be digested entirely all at once, and those nutrients you're gonna stay in the blood.\n\n Probably what I would do if I were to work out and I haven't worked out since 1979, I would drink it while I was working out and continue for about an hour after.\n\n\r\nIt could be either, not both.\n\n I think both would demineralize you too much and if you're going to workout like that, if you're going to do workouts and be a heavy athlete, it's a good idea you eat a lot of cheese all day long, just sugar cubed size amounts every hour to an hour and a half, make sure you're collecting the poisons.\n\n\r\nSo, they're not staying in cause those poisons always carry heavy mineral concentrations, and if they start collecting anywhere, you're gonna have those little crystals storing in your tissues, lacerating, causing scarring.\n\n So, it's a good idea to have the cheese going through you, and then when you have the whey or the vinegar, it's going to dissolve the crystals and then they'll be drawn to the digestive tract where the cheese will pull it into the digestive tract and hold onto it like a sponge and pass it out of the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou can just drink as much whey as you want.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because again, you're gonna demoralize the system?\n\n It's like vinegar, it's just not concentrated like vinegar.\n\n So, if you're an athlete or let's say you're a massage therapist, you're working all day long, you could go through three cups of the whey a day and maybe a teaspoon of vinegar a day broken up into maybe a third of a teaspoon at a time throughout the day.\n\n If you're a ditch Digger or you work with horses, something that causes a lot of physical activity and exertion, you can use the whey throughout today, or a little bit of vinegar throughout the day, space it out.\n\n\r\nAnd if you find you're stiff, you're not taking enough.\n\n If you find that you're getting bleeds and your skin's getting thin and your lips are getting very acidic and starting to burn, then you're not eating enough minerals.\n\n You need more cheese.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) What Chicken Is Okay \n \n \n \n \n### (71) Why Do Ppl Die Of Cancer, Five Year Death Occurance \n \n**[2008],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey don't usually don't die of cancer unless a particular tumor is blocking their digestive tract or their wind passage\n\n Normally, they die of chemotherapy, radiation therapy of medical treatment, lots of antibiotics.\n\n That's usually what kills people.\n\n Cause people who do this die and then don't get medical therapy, 95% of them survive.\n\n\r\nIn medical profession only about 50% make it 5 years, and they use the 5 year cutout period, cuz guess what.\n\n In the next year to a year and a half 40 more percent will die?\n\n\r\nSo, that's why the use of the five year cutoff period, we cured you.\n\n And then if you get an next incident, \"Oh no, it's a whole new occurrence, it has nothing to do with the old cancer\".\n\n Absolute bullshit.\n\n So, that answer your question.\n\n \r\nI mean, there are other things, you can put vinegar on it, but of course, anything that destabilizes it irritates the surrounding cells is not the best way to do it?\n\n\r\nYou want to nutrify the area.\n\n You want the healthy cells to survive and you've heard of being a flake.\n\n Well, you wanna be a flake sometimes, just flake off those dead cells.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n"

        "content": "### (1) Fat Vs Protein Cancer Reversal \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAs I said in the first book, 65% of my cases of cancer reverse with fats alone\n\n Using proteins alone, very few of them.\n\n So, fats a major issue with almost all disease, even cancer, it's important.\n\n So, remember that if you've got toxins in your body, when you have cancer, you're gonna build up a lot of toxins everywhere in the body and it's a breakdown the liver.\n\n\r\nThe liver's not digesting fats properly to make the cholesterols bind and to dissolve dead cells, so they just keep collecting the body.\n\n So, you're in a dangerous situation.\n\n Fats are so important to bind with those poisons, dissolve those poisons.\n\n If you don't have them, guess where the poisons go, right into the cells.\n\n\r\nYou can do damage to chromosomes, may not recover.\n\n Then people do not recover.\n\n People who stay thin do not recover.\n\n Owanza would go from 82 pounds when she was vomiting and vomiting and vomiting and starting to discharge tumors, but as soon as that cycle was over, I didn't think she was gonna live five times, but she made it through.\n\n 5' 2\" and 82 pounds.\n\n\r\nNo, she went down to 68 pounds.\n\n A teenager, 12 years old.\n\n Then she would gain all this weight, up to 140, 160 pounds.\n\n So, she would put it on when she had to.\n\n People who reverse their illnesses quickest on this diet, allow themselves to get fat.\n\n\r\nThose who don't, move very slowly, especially actresses because they want to stay slim.\n\n Sure, their blood will stay stable and they'll have more energy, but when they have a breakdown in detoxification, they don't get through it easily, and don't recover easily, it lingers because they don't have that excess fat to protect them, so it starts damaging your cells.\n\n\r\nLife cells, weakens them, makes them irritable.\n\n\r\nSo, fat is the most important, all fat.\n\n If it's a disease mainly dealing with the nerve tissue, cream is the best.\n\n If it's dealing with any other part of the body, butter is better.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (2) Fresh Vs Rotten Meat \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat are the specific benefits from the three different types of kind of high meat\n\n\r\nFish, fowl, and beef?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThe fish helps replace the inner elements, the constituents of nerve tissue the best\r\nThe fowl helps the nerve lining, the sheath, the intestines, the bones, the bone cartilage, lymphatic system, any of the white glands, connective tissue, the skin.\n\n\r\nRed meat helps blood, the dark glands, liver, gallbladder, spleen, bone marrow and muscles.\n\n \r\nSo, if you eat the high beef, it will help break down, dissolve the degenerative tissue those particular systems.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould the same apply to glands and stuff like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat will concentrate on that gland, and other glands.\n\n \r\nThe fresh will help rebuild it and the high will help get rid of degenerative tissue in those systems.\n\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWill high meat help rebuild.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'll help rebuild only in that it helps break down that tissue to be replaced?\n\n\r\nA lot of people can't break it down.\n\n If they can't break it down, they can't replace it.\n\n\r\nBecause cooked food destroys all the bacteria, all the natural elements in parasites in every animal cell, and once you cook it, you destroy all of that, so your body doesn't have that natural ability to just have a recycling going on in the ecological system.\n\n Balanced ecological system.\n\n\r\nBy eating the high meats you're replenishing all of that.\n\n \r\nJust put it in jars, and if you have it in a cooler, just change the ice.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Gain Or Lose Not Heavy Enough \n \n**[2005],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBefore I gained like 34 pounds, and then I started experimenting with the weight loss bit\n\n  \r\nI gained 34, but I noticed since the time that I started- it didn't happen all the sudden, I started losing the excess fat that was in my body, and especially the last one I started to get so stressed out.\n\n My libido was really down, it just changed me.\n\n \r\nBefore I was feeling like really happy, I started fighting the person I was involved with and it was just such a change just from doing that.\n\n \r\nSo, my question was, instead of doing the weight loss, should I just stay the same.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhen people are thin, I never suggest that they go on a weight loss?\n\n \r\nI don't care if it takes five years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nEven after 34 pounds.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, she gained fine, but I'm talking about some other people?\n\n  \r\nYou just keep pushing and pushing, pushing until they finally develop.\n\n \r\nAgain, the reason for that is if you don't have excess fat and you have poisons in the body, you always have poisons in the body, that'll go into the fat instead of your live active cells.\n\n You don't want them there cause that's gonna cause damage.\n\n \r\nContinue on the weight gain.\n\n \r\nYou're still too thin.\n\n You're not even up to your lowest.\n\n You've got 10 more pounds, and then from there at least 12, 15 pounds above that, then think about going on a weight loss.\n\n \r\nIt takes time.\n\n Sometimes the liver's just not well enough to be able to digest and handle the fats or you're so toxic that your body's using all the fats to detoxify and burn.\n\n  \r\nWe're talking about thin people; we're not talking about fat people.\n\n Those fat people are still healthier because the toxins are going into their fat and they're not damaging their cells.\n\n They're not feeding those live cells very well, but at least they're protecting them with all that fat.\n\n \r\nAnd let me tell you, the people who are happier and more level headed are the people who are obese that come to me and go on the diet.\n\n People who are very thin are the ones that are basket cases.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nEven if they got fat from like carbs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEven if it's from that, those fats still bind with those poisons.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThey're not the healthiest.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, no, no.\n\n I'm saying usually the person has more equilibrium.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs there a point where it can be bad.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it can be, if you don't have enough proteins and you're damaging your cells?\n\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n \r\nIf you're not feeding the heart protein and you've got all this excess.\n\n weight.\n\n You're putting stress on the heart.\n\n You'll damage it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Herbs \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, it depends upon\n\n If herbs are fresh and you juice them, they're very potent, full of enzymes, vitamins, everything's packed in.\n\n Once you dry it, everything's dead.\n\n You get some minerals from it, you can get some other chemical products from it, but it won't be in a balance.\n\n  \r\nThat's why I said in the book, if you're gonna make, make a sun tea with it if it's an emergency type thing, otherwise we're in Southern California, get your herbs fresh and juice them.\n\n  \r\nBut if you're having an herb that is concentrated, other than parsley or salary, make sure you only have 5% of your juices.\n\n  \r\nCilantro pulls out a lot of metals.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about herbal extracts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey're all processed?\n\n \r\nProcessed, distilled, solvent extracted; alcohol may be the solvent or petroleum, like brake fluid.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nCause they talk about the probiotics as a friendly bacteria, which is kind of like the herb that is also dry and not alive.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIs it dried.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIf it's in a powdered form, it's dried?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's right.\n\n It's not active, and not alive and it will take a lot for your body to rehydrate that herb just to get a little bit of something out of it.\n\n  \r\nRemember, we don't have those enzymes to break down cellulose \r\nOur enzymes and digestive juices are for meats, for animal protein.\n\n \r\nTakes an herbivore to break down those herbs, vegetation.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) How To Get Kids On Primal \n \n**[2005],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's my house, and I have to deal with your emotions\n\n Help me help you.\n\n And that's what I tell all my parents.\n\n\r\nI have parents that went through a heavy change with their children and every mother that's gotten their children to do it 25% within a year, they're 50% within another year, they're 75% because the kids naturally move toward them.\n\n \r\nBut you have to start them giving them one meal a day.\n\n \r\nYou think they're gonna go somewhere else rather than be with you over that.\n\n \r\nBut we're not talking about raw meat, we're talking about raw milkshakes?\n\n\r\nNow I got all the evidence in the book prove that raw milk is a benefit, not a harm.\n\n Pasteurized milk is a harm.\n\n \r\nAs long as you force them to eat least one good raw meal a day with egg and cream, it will help them.\n\n \r\nAnd you'll see, they'll adjust as you go along, then you can make meat too.\n\n Like most of the parents that I have, they force them to have the milkshake in the morning ana milkshake at night.\n\n\r\nThat is it.\n\n They have to do it.\n\n If they don't like it, they can go live in the street.\n\n\r\nYou can see the adjustment, it's a big difference.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (6) Milk Swelling & Mucus - Clabber \n \n \n \n \n### (7) Nudity In France - Lots Of Cream & Butter Lets Them Drink Wine \n \n can tell\n\n They had had quite a few children and their breasts were like I see in late twenties, early thirties here, and they're 50, 60, 80 years old?\n\n It was just amazing too.\n\n  \r\nThere were girls that going around selling clothes on the beach and they would just take everything off and just right there, they don't have any of these bare body hang-ups and, they'll just strip completely bear, testicles and everything and change right on the beach.\n\n \r\nIt's only for a few seconds, but there's no red reluctance about it, no fear, there's no anxiety, there's no hostility.\n\n Everybody does it.\n\n It was so refreshing to be in that kind of a culture.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow much butter, fat or cream do you have to have before you drink wine.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* I'm not suggesting it?\n\n Cream and butter before your drink it.\n\n They usually drink the wine before eating their dish, it's also got heavy cream or butter in the dish.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nAll raw.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, not anymore?\n\n Well, let me put it this way.\n\n There are a lot of French chefs that use raw still.\n\n They still use raw.\n\n  \r\nFrance was the easiest place for me to get raw cream, raw butter, and raw milk.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, there's actually a French style restaurant in this new shopping center called Grove, and in there they have a list of 30 or 40 different raw milk cheeses.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAre they salted.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt either has to be pasteurized or salted?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy do they like having the salt and why are they okay if it has salt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe salt is an anti-bacterial?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIs the answer fat and sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nFat and sun?\n\n Also, if women will do an exercise like you do a counter like this one, everybody can see.\n\n \r\nAnd if you spread your arms down like this and you don't go too far, and you go like this and breathe the circulation in to the mammary glands, and it isn't hard.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow many can you do.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAs many as you want?\n\n \r\nWhen you start feeling it, you know that the rush of circulation is going in there, will start breaking down dead cells that cause sagging, and it'll strengthen the muscles in there.\n\n I've seen girls go from sagging down here to go to a full 2.\n\n5\" up, doing that every day.\n\n Not at one time, they may do 10 at a time, 5 times a day.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Nut Formula In Fridge \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, my question is centered around this nut formula, which I think is fantastic, once or twice is really great, and if I make too much of it, is there anything wrong with just putting in a jar with a lid on it and putting in the fridge\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes?\n\n Don't put it in fridge, leave it out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor a couple days.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI'd left it out for as much as a week?\n\n\r\nNever refrigerate eggs.\n\n When you put eggs in the refrigerator, it lowers the bacteria level and the enzyme activity.\n\n\r\nUsually, if you eat raw eggs that have been refrigerated, you get undigested proteins into the blood, and that's toxic.\n\n \r\nAs long as you get them you can leave them out.\n\n the bacteria will grow again, and the enzymes will develop.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHow long do you have to leave them out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUsually 24 hours, unless you put it in warm water?\n\n If you put it in warm water to warm up, maybe an hour, two hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan I leave them in the cupboard.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it's if they're refrigerated and you want to eat them right away?\n\n Take this cold refrigerated egg and put in bowl of warm water and you let it sit for a couple of hours.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, if I have excess, just put it in a jar and set it somewhere out of the sunlight.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Preserving Food With Ice Block \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nDo you have a car\n\n That's the easiest?\n\n When I have a rental car, not a hotel, I take one of those big plastic coolers.\n\n I put a block of ice in there.\n\n I block of ice will last four days.\n\n So, I don't have to change the ice every day \r\nBut in a car, you got big that plastic cooler with that big block, seven-pound block and drain out some of the water every day, but you don't want the ice, you want the block.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do you get the block.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEvery supermarket here caries it, most of your liquor stores have blocks?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's harder to get blocks.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEvery place I've gone to I've gotten them in the last past three years.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou can form the ice to the food.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but you don't want to form them?\n\n You don't want it to touch the food because they can burn the food.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThe ice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt doesn't matter if the ice is packed right against it, it can burn the food.\n\n \r\nPut ice against you in a cooler and see what happens to your skin.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI wouldn't even wanna be in a cooler.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n*Laughs* \r\nSo, a block works very well, and there hasn't been a place that I've seen all the way across this country that doesn't sell a block of ice.\n\n \r\nAt 7-11, they have the choice.\n\n They don't have many of the blocks, they have a lot of the crushed ice or the ice cubes, but they all have the blocks.\n\n Just have to ask them.\n\n \r\nYou saw me on RIpleys Believe It or Not, I ate it for 1 year and 3 months.\n\n The last six months it wasn't even in a cooler, it was on my back porch.\n\n No cooling at all.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nBut you only eat a little bit of it, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou know how much I eat on that fricking show?\n\n Usually, I eat just a little bit, went on that show, had a full cup.\n\n Cause they had me eating so much.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nDid you detox.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt didn't cause me to detox?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nIt might be for somebody else, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nDon't know?\n\n Might.\n\n but you don't want eat that there, but she's saying she had like a full meal or something.\n\n**[Jim]**\n \r\nIs a golf ball size the right amount.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it depends upon the individual, anywhere from a ping-pong sized ball to a golf ball?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI just chop the meat up and let it dry out.\n\n It smells for a minute, and I just carry it in my pocket.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's not as healthy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat do you mean that's not as healthy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause it's starting to dehydrate, destroying a lot of the enzymes, and bacteria once it's dehydrated?\n\n \r\nThat's why the Eskimos and the American Indians, when they made pemmican, they didn't eat it unless they had to because dried meat is not something they like because it wouldn't help regenerate cells.\n\n Would give them energy and help them maintain and last, but it would not cause them to thrive.\n\n  \r\nSo, they would make a big batch of pemmican every year, if they didn't eat it by the spring time, they buried it.\n\n \r\nJar in a dark cupboard.\n\n \r\nOr put it in a container and put it in your car, then it's very delicious.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYou don't put your meat in the refrigerator.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe night before I'll take it out and put it in the cupboard or I'll put it in my car, so it can be very warm by the time I go to eat it?\n\n \r\nIf it's cold it's flat, it's tasteless, but warm, especially really warm.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Radiation Treatments Cause Food Acidic \n \n**[2003],[Attendee],[unclear]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAll meats have salt in it and because I'm so sensitive to salt that even if I have a little bit of \n, red meat especially, chicken\n\n I don't need to use sauces cause I thought it was the sauces that made my mouth burn, but it's the meats with the salt, they burn my mouth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's the acidic minerals in the meats.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOther people eat a lot of it and they don't get bothered by it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's because they didn't have radiation therapy.\n\n Radiation therapy causes everything to go twice as acidic, the city, and even transforms some of the naturally alkalinizing minerals into acid minerals.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's why everything I eat-  \r\n\n \r\nThat's why every time you eat something, you start discharging more of poisons out the gums out, out the tongue, the lips.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd my whole body starts itching too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSame thing with mine.\n\n Like I said, I used to have cracks this long, all the way down to here.\n\n My mouth was just bleeding, cracks all the way up into here.\n\n \r\nYou see some scars.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut you continued eating it, even though you had these symptoms.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's no way to stop it?\n\n I just constantly put cold cream in my mouth just to soothe myself.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, I'm not not going eliminate eating chicken, beef, and fish.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you do, you're not going to get well.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo continue.\n\n Keep on trucking on?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, mine was a little bit worse than yours, you're gonna have heavy buildup of dead cells, dead tissue here from the dryness?\n\n Generally, the cracking.\n\n I had the chemotherapy.\n\n It said damages cells, it damages the vitamin K, and vitamin, so it prevents proper clotting.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Rubber Water Bottles \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou said about the hot water bottle, can I put it right in this area\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nBecause Basal Cell cancer is very acidic, if you put it here, it might start burning because it'll perspire with it?\n\n So, it's better to have it over here.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay,  that's where it actually feels better.\n\n I put it on my ear, it feels so good.\n\n I put it here and I'm uncomfortable.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI had the same problem when I had cancer on my face.\n\n\r\nWell, I don't like these because it's a synthetic material.\n\n I just found a company that actually makes rubber water bottles.\n\n So, it takes a lot more heat without falling apart.\n\n\r\nEspecially Laurie, Laurie likes to have those things cooking, and it says 140 degrees max, she put 160 degrees in there.\n\n Burn her self\r\nThey're all rubber, smell like rubber, of course, and they smell like burned rubber when you first put hot water in them.\n\n So, what I do is I'll fill them up a couple times and leave them outside for about three weeks before I use them to cut down on the rubber, but it just smells like a rubber tire at first.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Salt Cravings & Edema \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhen I drink juice, a lot of celery, I get pretty bloated and I noticed sodium does that for me too\n\n So, I don't know if this has to do with sodium.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWere you a big salt eater.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI never crave salt, but I definitely liked salt?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUsually that occurs in people who have an allergy to sodium, salt, and it stores in their body from all the years of adding having had the salt.\n\n So, you have all these salt storages throughout the system, crystals, and whenever you take the sodium in the celery juice, it starts breaking it up.\n\n So, it causes edema.\n\n \r\nAnd the reason it costs edema is because you'll have a clumping of sodium ion, and when the sodium clumps, passes the cell, cells eat by ionization, they have 1 to 2 ions as their stomach.\n\n When they need to eat, they'll track, let's say a potassium ion, which can carry some glucagon or glycogen with it and they can get sugar that way.\n\n \r\nSodium usually carries H20 with it, so if the cell opens to draw in some sodium to get the H20 and clumping, the magnetism of the ion cell is so great that it rips the ion, magnetizes the ion and rips the guts out of the cell.\n\n Cell shrivels like a raisin and all this excess fluid stays in the blood serum and does not get into the cells.\n\n \r\nAnd that causes the edema.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat's from salt or celery.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's from the salt in your body, sodium pulling the salts out, getting recycled into the blood, and then it would be done?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd what happens to that cell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat cell is dead?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, if you're drinking a celery juice, it shrivels up the cell.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, it can?\n\n The body will usually regulate itself.\n\n \r\nThat's normally what happens when you put salt in the body.\n\n If you're using high sodium foods like tomatoes, watermelon, celery juice, which is high in sodium.\n\n It doesn't cause a clumping even though it's concentrated in sodium.\n\n It'll start pulling that out.\n\n  \r\nWhen that happens, very few cells are affected that way with the clumping cause the celery juice, or tomato juice, watermelon juice will keep it from clustering.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, is it healing the damage somehow.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, when it comes out, the body will try to keep the salt from clumping, try to disperse it and then throw it out kidneys?\n\n \r\nSome will be perspired if you exercise, some of them be gotten rid of that way.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, is it better to continue doing this or sort of cut back on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAre you discomforted by it?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, it's not painful or anything, but I can't wear my clothes?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThen do a hot bath or exercise and perspire it off, but the quicker you get it out of your body.\n\n  \r\nSalt storages in the body cause the worst cravings.\n\n Can cause you to have cravings for candy, carbohydrates, starches, starch carbohydrates, more water, all kinds of salt imbalances, the whole chemistry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, celery, tomato, and watermelon to flush that out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but if you have watermelon, you better eat a lot of cream, if you're having tomatoes, you also have some cream That way, if the sodium ions are clumping, the fats there to bind and reduces magnetism?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, have cream every time you have tomatoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI'm not saying that.\n\n I'm saying most of the time.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat works?\n\n Just not as well.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nWhat about yogurt.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat would be okay?\n\n \r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Teeth Fillings Damage \n \n**[2003],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI was told I need a filling and I asked the guy about it and he said if I let it go the bacteria will eat through and eventually get your nerve, and I think you have a different opinion about that, but my thought was\n\n \r\nIf you have something wrong with the tooth already, is it the same theory that the bacteria is doing something to that already damage material or is the bacteria actually eating away at the tooth.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, you've asked a very large subject?\n\n I'm not gonna go into it fully.\n\n If you have, let's say composite, which is plastic.\n\n \r\nIt sets off dioxins and phthalates.\n\n It causes bacteria to grow underneath, also causes a recession of gum, also causes a recession of nerves.\n\n Composites are not good things to put plastic fillings.\n\n \r\nGet inlays or onlays or ceramic.\n\n Those are the things to use.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nCrowns.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey only make that in crowns?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut there's metal under there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n That's to reinforce.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThat's okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n It's gold.\n\n You should ask for gold.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nYou can get gold or you can get a combination of gold and platinum, which is stronger than the gold alone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nComposites are not good.\n\n And of course, if you have amalgam fillings, that's 50% mercury, and that poisons the nerve all the way back.\n\n \r\nI had all my albums removed in 1978.\n\n They left all my teeth grey, there wasn't tooth in my head.\n\n \r\nI've only seen young people repair their teeth on this diet.\n\n You're so toxic, it takes 40 years to get well.\n\n Teeth are the hardest place to repair.\n\n You have no circulation going on the outside.\n\n The only way you can feed is from within?\n\n Bones on the inside, it takes 7.\n\n5 years to replace every cell in the bone 5x.\n\n \r\nBut you've got circulation coming from every direction in teeth.\n\n You don't have that restorative ability.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about the nerves surrounding them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, they can be severely damaged from all the mercury in amalgams?\n\n \r\nYeah, that just shows that your nerves are not strong yet.\n\n Now, all my teeth dangled after the chemo and radiation.\n\n It's deteriorated all of the bone around my teeth, so my teeth just dangled, very sensitive and sore.\n\n If I went like that, I'd lose half a cup of blood at a time.\n\n So, I had to drink everything through a straw and they wanted to pull all my teeth, and I said, \"Well, I'm gonna die in a few months\".\n\n \r\n21 years old, I wasn't going to do it.\n\n It took years, but the raw cheese really helped me stabilize.\n\n Basically, it's my cheese cake: half butter, half cheese, little bit more butter than cheese sometimes.\n\n And after about a year and a half, bones grew back, stabilized within the last six years.\n\n  \r\nI still have most of my teeth.\n\n I'd say I have one here missing and this is deteriorated.\n\n That one's taken 20 years to deteriorate.\n\n \r\nNo decay.\n\n Every time I go to the dentist, there's no decay there.\n\n It's just that the acid keeps dissolving the tooth cause it's open.\n\n There's no dentine to stop the acids in my mouth from breaking it down.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Vacation \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThis time instead of going into Q&A, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my experience on vacation\n\n I went to Guadeloupe, which is an island in the West Indies.\n\n It's French owned and French speaking.\n\n They speak Creo and French there, no English like somebody's from Montreal.\n\n So, it's very difficult to find anybody to speak English.\n\n \r\nI don't speak French well enough to have any conversation about nutrition.\n\n So, that's why I went there and I would be assured to have a vacation \r\nIt worked; it was a fun time.\n\n One day, I went to go hiking, on Guadeloupe it's like two islands flooded together and one is called Grande-Terre and the other's called Bastard.\n\n So, every time you say it you say bastard, but it's Basse-Terre, but in French, it's called Basse-Terre, but it sounds like you star with a hard r.\n\n So, it's bastard and Grande-Terre.\n\n \r\nThe Grande-Terre, it's very hilly, lots of hills and valleys, so I drove all through that and it was nice.\n\n The other island is where the volcano is.\n\n It's not an active volcano and jungle all around it, and mainly on these two islands the Grande-Terre is mainly sugarcane.\n\n The other island is mainly coffee, and bananas.\n\n \r\nSo, it's heavily farmed, but it's gorgeous.\n\n So, I was going to go on the natural human path, which is just cut through, it's pretty rocky and messy, and I went with these rubber tongs and in my shorts and a t-shirt and I was going on this road and I just didn't want to be on the road anymore.\n\n \r\nSo, I started going to the animal trails.\n\n That's rough cause you have to go under, and you have to climb over these groups of big, tall roots.\n\n Tall ceiling and then falling over them.\n\n It was wonderful, and I actually spent about five hours climbing through the jungle trying to find the waterfall, and finally got to it and there were a couple of people on the diet who were professional rock climbers and, they forced me to go up.\n\n \r\nSo, I went, it was okay, but I was always afraid of Heights, and since the stomach surgery, I've always been nauseous from heights, but something came over me and I climbed all the way down the falls and then all the way down the lower falls.\n\n A rock lining all the way, it's phenomenally with these palms.\n\n \r\nAnd how many times they broke, they were well made tongs, their actual rubber, never find anything like that in the United States.\n\n And I had one of those Swiss army knives, so they have 28 tools.\n\n So, I was able to punch it back through, and I had only banged up my nails and looked at my nails, I had a few cuts on my toes.\n\n \r\nBut it was pretty easy.\n\n It was pretty good, and I was just so amazed that I was able to do that.\n\n And then the last day I was there, they had a thing called cirque, which means circus, and they have trapeze.\n\n I turn 56 in 2 months, and I get up there on the trapeze, about 30 feet or so high.\n\n \r\nYou pull the trapeze over and I'm nauseous as hell.\n\n I got up there and I was very nauseous and I said, I'm gonna have to stand here until the nausea goes.\n\n If the nausea doesn't go, I'm not jumping, just trapped.\n\n So, I waited about five, six minutes, the nausea went away, and then of course, when I had to hang out and grab the thing, the nausea came back.\n\n So, I stood there for a good two minutes and knew what they had me strapped on the bungee cords on the side, couldn't be a terrible accident.\n\n  \r\nThe only thing that was a rude awakening is it's right near the equation and it's only about 500 miles north of Venezuela, and it was very humid.\n\n \r\nI was perspiring like crazy when I was going through the jungle and of course I was drinking the water coming from the stream.\n\n There are these signs, photograph signs showing the snail with this parasite that goes here to man, and what it causes, don't drink this water.\n\n I didn't seem to get any, I drank probably two liters of that water, but I had to drink more water.\n\n I drank probably four liters in the last three days that I was there and that's how much I drank in the whole year here or at least through the fall and winter.\n\n  \r\nSo, that vegetable juice was very important.\n\n So, the next time I go on a trip like that, I would definitely take my juice with me, so I don't have to drink the water because at the end of that, I got home, I found my teeth very sensitive.\n\n Other people won't react as much as I do because I normally don't drink water, but water's very leaching, like I said.\n\n \r\nAnd I took lots of cream with me.\n\n I couldn't get any red meat, I had little lamb chops a couple times, but there's no red meat on that island unless it's frozen.\n\n Fresh fish every day right off the dock, and I had it in my rental car, not even wrapped tightly, not in the jar or plastic bag, sitting in the back.\n\n \r\nI had big swordfishes there, and they're just cutting them up right there in big chunks, but I'm used to having a lot of red meat, and I had only a couple of lamb chops there, as far as meat.\n\n I was there for seven days.\n\n  \r\nI did have some of the New Zealand beef, one quart jar of it, and I didn't eat it until I had to, about the sixth day there, and it was just like fresh.\n\n I had it in the hotel room with ice on it, change the ice every day.\n\n I turned refrigeration off, air conditioning off because I don't like air conditioning and I don't worry about mosquitos because I only got bit three times while I was there and I slept on the beach.\n\n I just liked having a hotel room.\n\n \r\nI went to Club Met.\n\n They knew who you are.\n\n Can always find somebody that speaks English there if you need to, and to always fall back.\n\n If nobody knows you, and you don't speak the language well, and something happens.\n\n It could be difficult to get help.\n\n \r\nIt was very enjoyable, but I would definitely take more red meat with me in the future.\n\n And I did take enough cream, I took 8 ounces a day for the entire seven days and a little bit of sour cream.\n\n I forgot my cheese in Florida, that would save my lower mineral problem.\n\n \r\nI had plenty of butter, had everything I needed.\n\n \r\nI took my primal facial body care cream, which I use for sunscreen when it's hot, closer to the sun in the winter, 3 million miles closer to the sun, so it's much more intense.\n\n That's why in south America, when it's summer there, it's much hotter than it is here in the summer.\n\n So, it's very intense sun.\n\n \r\nThe one day that I didn't put it on before I went out to the beach, and got into a salt water beach, which rips the fats off the skin.\n\n That two-hour period that I spent in the ocean water, I burned.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBecause i didn't use the primal facial body care cream?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat were the girls like.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, natives have been moved off of all the islands, except for one, just like in Hawaii?\n\n True natives' who belong to those West Indian islands were put on an island.\n\n Most the black people lived there who were slaves and Eastern Indians, so those are the two cultures there.\n\n \r\nAnd you talked about minorities, whites are minority.\n\n You're lucky if you're 5% percent of the population.\n\n They're very sociable and nice until you start going back into where they live and then it's not a very nice place, just like why are you driving in my neighborhood.\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (15) Weight Gain & Water Weight \n \n**[2003],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nFive more pounds is going to make a big difference, most likely\n\n \r\nWhat I suggest people do is to be on a good healthy diet for six months before you try to lose the old toxic fat just so you can stabilize the system.\n\n\r\nWell, most women like you will gain water weight.\n\n As the body starts going in and cleaning out, more circulation, more fluid required.\n\n So, it's not more fat.\n\n It's just temporary water weight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's so difficult for me to eat fat.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat means your liver is in pretty bad shape, so eat more cream for a while, which causes water retention and have some butter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) What Kind Of

to open up certain channels, how does that actually work\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n If we're not mobile and we've got congestion in the system, you can get all kinds of nerve networks that will clog.\n\n It's like having a bridge that gets overgrown, it starts falling apart and it's no longer utilizable.\n\n \r\nWhen you start doing movements, it brings the circulation in, and if you're eating properly, you can rebuild those bridges, those canals faster from doing those Tai Chi, moving, yoga, any of them.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre they better than just normal exercise, you know, running around and playing sports or something like that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nDepends on what sport you're doing?\n\n When you're lifting weights, same position, it's not as good.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, just general exercise is probably better than aerobic exercise.\n\n Is that what you're saying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWhatever your enjoyment is, whatever you enjoy doing as your exercise, that's the exercise?\n\n Then you want to achieve something more than doing something else, and hopefully you'll like it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Young Women Saggy Breasts

\n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI had surgery 10 days ago\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot you!  \r\n\n \r\nYes, I had surgery.\n\n About two years ago, I started having blood in my urine and then I got to the point where two weeks ago I had to lift my leg like a dog to urinate because I had a stone in my bladder.\n\n So, I went to a urologist and he did the sonogram, says the biggest stone he'd ever seen, 4.\n\n2 millimeters by 2.\n\n7 millimeters.\n\n \r\nBiggest stone he'd ever seen.\n\n He said it would take about 30 minutes to blast it apart.\n\n There wasn't actually any cutting.\n\n He put a tube up my urethra and the camera up there and he showed the canal.\n\n  \r\nNow, ever since I was a child, my mother was very upset with me because I used to take a long time to urinate.\n\n Take me 3 to 5 minutes to urinate, so she'd slap me on the back of the head, \"Hurry up\".\n\n She didn't realize that I had a deformed urethra.\n\n It was very thin and very small where it went through the prostate.\n\n  \r\nSo, all these years, I've not been emptying my bladder completely.\n\n She always got me into the habit of as soon as the flow stopped, and the sensation of having to urinate stopped.\n\n I would stop my flow, but that causes crystals to form and stones to form.\n\n  \r\nSo, when he went to blast this, I went into surgery on Tuesday, a week ago, so that was like 12 days ago.\n\n He said it would take probably 30 minutes to blast it apart.\n\n Took him two hours.\n\n He said that stone had been forming for 45 years minimum.\n\n  \r\nSo, it's that long to affect me, but he said he had never seen it.\n\n He's blasted- anybody know James Stewart.\n\n He had 10 of those from being a vegetarian, eating all that soy.\n\n He had 10 of them.\n\n He went to the same urologist.\n\n Urologist blasted his in an hour and a half, 10 of them.\n\n  \r\nMy one took two hours to blast out of the system.\n\n He said the core was completely black and an analysis showed it was mainly thimerosal from vaccines.\n\n So, when I was a child and got the vaccinations, that mercury had gone to my urethra and because I wasn't emptying completely, it was collecting in there, and that was the core of it.\n\n Mercury solid core center.\n\n  \r\nSo, while he was there, I said, wouldn't be a bad idea if you cut the urethra, opened it up into a V shape and let me heal around it, so I could pee like normal.\n\n Because when I urinate and there's a couple people that watch me pee to the side over here, when I do the hot tub, there's just a little child stream and it's always been.\n\n \r\nNow I pee like a race horse \r\nSo, there are situations where this diet cannot help you and you will have to have medical.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Bladder Surgey, Empty

blurry vision vision the most was red meat believe it or not.\n\n Don't know why.\n\n \r\nI put 'em on chicken,  I put 'em on fish.\n\n I put 'em on high chicken, high fish to get to the nerves in the eye, but nothing stopped the blurred vision like red meat.\n\n\r\nI don't know why.\n\n It doesn't make any logical sense, but it's the way it is.\n\n \r\nCarrot juice is very helpful in combination with your other juices, carrot juice and coconut cream and cream together helps correct the damage in eyes to help improve eye vision.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about beef eyes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's great?\n\n Eating eyeballs is very helpful, but I haven't seen a great- the Indians used to eat eyeballs if any of 'em were having a deficiency and yes, it helped them a lot.\n\n \r\nBut on this program, people won't eat enough eyeballs.\n\n You just can't get enough of them, you've got a huge animal and two eyeballs.\n\n Just not enough eyeballs to go around for me to experiment enough, to see how well they will work if they have a diet high in eyeballs.\n\n\r\nBut there's not many people who eat eyeballs, so if you can go to North Star Bison,  and ask her to send you all the eyeballs.\n\n Not many people order them, and you can see how much it will change your eyesight.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Brain Detox \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's all those vaccines sense, it went to the brain\n\n The brain and nervous system use tons of metallic minerals to relay light and electricity as their function.\n\n \r\nSo, where's the body store most of those heavy metals, the brain and nervous system.\n\n \r\nWhere does the brain detoxify.\n\n Mainly through the tongue, gums and salivary glands, ripping her metal apart?\n\n Making it a very toxic,\r\nDoesn't make any difference.\n\n As long as she's had heavy doses of vaccines, when you go into the military, you get like 27 to 35 in a week period.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Can Bacteria Be Toxic \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nBacteria could be harmful if you're not eating properly\n\n I mean, if you don't have the, the nutrients to support yourself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n Let's say you eat a food that has been cooked and it's been sitting out and you got lots of bacteria that's fed on it.\n\n The, the verotoxins that are their experiment, you have to deal with and if they're highly toxic and they're concentrated in heavy metals, it's going to be a poison.\n\n You're going to have diarrhea and vomit.\n\n It's your body getting rid of it, t's not about, I'm gonna show I'm so tough, I'm gonna hold in this garbage.\n\n No, the body's saying I don't want it.\n\n This is going to harm me, so I'm going to have vomit and diarrhea and get rid of it.\n\n The body's not saying, I'm going to eat this because I'm real tough.\n\n No, you are doing it.\n\n You're eating it because you've been programmed to eat that garbage, eat cooked food, but it's cooked foods that's aged and old, and as the bacteria gets into it and feeds on it and mutates and puts off highly toxic verotoxins.\n\n\r\nThe verotoxins become highly charged, highly caustic.\n\n You got a problem, but it'll usually be just diarrhea and vomit, unless the medical profession gets hold of you.\n\n Makes you take steroids and antibiotics and all stuff like this, then you damage your intestines more and then it becomes a process of trying to get rid of more poisons and it'll be an endless process.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Can Diet Break Down Stones \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNow is it possible that being on the diet, the diet will take care of stones\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, it won't?\n\n I've tried with many people trying to dissolve their stones and because heavy metals do not break up easily, you'd have to drink probably a quart of grapefruit or lemon juice a day, and then you'd demineralize your body along with the stone.\n\n \r\nSo, there's no way.\n\n I've tried with many people to help them dissolve their stones over years, even my own.\n\n\r\nYeah, but yours was an early stage and it wasn't forming over a period of years.\n\n It works if you caught it in the beginning, but I was 45 years minimum, I was 45 years into it.\n\n There was no way it was gonna dissolve.\n\n\r\nJames Stewart.\n\n He waited a year and a half, tried the formulas and none of them worked to dissolve his stones.\n\n He had his blasted and removed, he was a changed man after it also.\n\n So stones, you need help with stones.\n\n Most people will need help with removing stones, unless it's a very small stone and you've just begun to form them.\n\n\r\nThen you can use beet juice, grapefruit juice or a combination of the two and eat lots of cheese.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cancer and High Meat \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJim, do you have a question\n\n**[Jim]**\n\r\nYes, I do?\n\n How would a person diagnosed with cancer determine if high meat is appropriate for that particular person or not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, it depends upon what kind of cancer they have and what's causing the toxicity?\n\n \r\nIf they aren't digesting well, of course they need to eat the high meat.\n\n If they're digesting well, high meat isn't going to especially help them, unless they have some neurological problem.\n\n Then they'll need it.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Cancer Survival Rate, Lung&esophogus Cancer \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, you look on the back of The Recipe for Living Without Disease, the bottom blurb is from a 57-year neuroscientist, Dr\n\n Elnora van Winkle.\n\n I gave her the names of 300 of my cancer patients, their addresses and telephone numbers.\n\n She spent a year calling, and interviewing all of them.\n\n \r\nAnd that little blurb says that the statistics on cancer reversal by Aajonus method is scientifically accurate, and it's 95% of the people who go on this diet with cancer reverse it and live beyond seven years.\n\n  \r\nI've lived 38 years.\n\n I have many patients who are 27, 16 years beyond.\n\n So, that's it, 95%.\n\n \r\nLung and esophageal cancer are another subject.\n\n It's only about 60% survive on this diet, because the lungs fill up, and most of those people cannot stay away from the doctors.\n\n So, they'll, they'll go get aspirated, they'll have the liquid removed.\n\n  \r\nEvery time they go for aspiration, the doctor automatically gives them antibiotics.\n\n Their digestion is destroyed for at least 25, 27 days, they're going downhill in that time.\n\n So, the reversal rate for lung cancer is only 60%, which is poor.\n\n Better than the medical profession, which is 5%, but still, it's not the greatest.\n\n  \r\nEsophageal cancer cuts off swallowing and breathing.\n\n Not much you can do there.\n\n \r\nIf somebody comes to me to the point where it's already grown, so not much I can do to help somebody.\n\n You can't swallow, you can't eat.\n\n  \r\nWell, I have one patient who lived for 3 years through a tube, and now he's outta the hospital and functioning and eating fine, but he lived for three years out of a tube.\n\n  \r\nBut his son was going four times a day, injecting the good food into him.\n\n That was the whole kid's life, his life was injecting the food in his father and work.\n\n And that was his whole life.\n\n His family relationship broke up, lost his kids, lost his wife and everything to keep his father alive.\n\n You know, I'm not sure that was worth it.\n\n \r\nHe doesn't live with his fucking father, his children, he doesn't raise his father.\n\n You know, his whole family may have been more important than his father living.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (14) Cant Sleep From Low Protein \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDifficulty sleeping at night\n\n Give us a dissertation on what not to eat, what to eat, night sweats.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n Okay.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs*\r\n\n\r\n90% of insomnia comes from protein deficiency and there are specific proteins that are formed by the E.\n\n coli.\n\n So, if you have a history of antibiotics as a child, you are one of those people that's in the category who will always have trouble sleeping well.\n\n\r\nAlso, has the tendency to cause Crohn's disease.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (15) Carrot Juice With Dairy & Coconut Cream \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen you have carrot juice with dairy cream and coconut cream, doesn't have that blood sugar problem\n\n If you have four to six ounces of carrot juice in the afternoon, instead of a fruit meal.\n\n So you're having this high carbohydrate in place of a fruit meal in the afternoon, and you have 2 ounces of dairy, and 3 ounces of coconut cream, you are not going to have a sugar problem with that.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (16) Cheese & Milk For Heavy Metals, Hair Mineral Analysis \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLots of cheese, lots of milk\n\n Stay away from vaccines like the plague, any kind of medication.\n\n\r\nWhat's bloodwork gonna tell you.\n\n\r\nBloodwork is not what's happening in the skin?\n\n\r\nIf you wanted to test something that might tell you what's happening in the skin is have your hair analyzed.\n\n You'll see what you're throwing off.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (17) Cheese Enzyme Def, Butter With Cheese \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRemember, cheese is enzyme deficient, so like any dried food, there are no bioactive enzymes\n\n Sure, there are all the particles of enzymes in it, but none of them are bioactive when a food substance is dried, it's dehydrated.\n\n So, if you eat cheese, it's a dried substance that will not digest, unless you eat it with honey.\n\n\r\nSo, as a good mineral supplement, it's fine to eat cheese and honey, if you want a good mineral supplement.\n\n So, you have osteoporosis or you have cancer and people who have cancer are always eating their own bones to get enough minerals to bind with the solvent byproduct of dissolving tumors, so the body will eat its own bone to do that.\n\n\r\nEating the cheese with honey prevents that from happening.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about butter.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEating butter with the cheese?\n\n That's fine if you have a tendency toward constipation, you should eat equal amounts of with butter with the cheese?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFor constipation: butter, honey, and cheese.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, if you're gonna eat cheese and it causes constipation, you need an equal amount or more butter with your cheese, and that'll keep you from getting constipated?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou don't have to add honey to it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou have to have the honey with it?\n\n The honey is your enzyme supplementation.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (18) Chelation \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI have a nephew that's had these stents put in twice in two years\n\n What about chelation for- just thinking about that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nChelation is one of the worst poisons that you can do in the body?\n\n What it is you're taking a chemical magnet, which is a chemical poison, and you're hoping that it'll go into the soft tissue, like the arteries and pull the plaque and the heavy metals out because plaquing mineral buildup is like a kidney stone or a bladder stone, any kind of stone.\n\n  \r\nProblem is that it doesn't exit the body.\n\n I've only found 24% of it left the body within a 48-hour period.\n\n After that, no sign of it leaving the body again out the urinary and fecal matter.\n\n \r\nSo, they're lying when they tell you it leaves the body within 24 hours, 48 hours.\n\n Say do it to my urine and check it in my feces, and you'll see a doesn't.\n\n The chemical itself, where's it store, it stores in the lymphatic system and bone.\n\n And you'll notice that people who've had chelation therapy, their skin is like taking aspirin, it starts getting thin and translucent.\n\n \r\nIt starts demineralizing the body and system.\n\n If you're getting those heavy metals out, your body needs calcium and a lot of other minerals to bind with it and harness it and control it.\n\n And that means demineralizing the skin and the bones and other tissue.\n\n  \r\nHowever, it does help keep some people alive, and it makes them more vibrant for a shorter period.\n\n It shortens their life, but their life is better temporarily, so that's the tradeoff.\n\n \r\nAgain, unless you have a fat-controlled environment, it is not going to leave your body.\n\n It is all wishful thinking, everybody wants to deliver a magic bullet, but nobody's doing the exact empirical test that prove it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (19) Chemical Sensitiviyt \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen a person gets chemically sensitive, that means they have so many chemicals in their body that even one little bit is the straw that breaks the camel's back\n\n Every time it enters the body.\n\n \r\nSo, anytime something enters the sinuses, the mouth anywhere, it automatically has to discharge, and there's a chemical reaction there.\n\n They're that sensitive.\n\n They're that so full of toxins in their system.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay.\n\n I'm on this special diet boring.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOf course.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIt's just so boring.\n\n\r\nMy diet, not your diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVery boring.\n\n And it will be boring until you stop having that sensitivity.\n\n \r\nWell, when you have that kind of a problem, you have mainly eat eggs every hour.\n\n \r\nWell, you're still gonna have that, and you better have that.\n\n If you don't have that, you're not gonna have the hormones to heal.\n\n I just hope it doesn't come at a bad time.\n\n So, you have to look at it differently.\n\n\r\nWhat you have to do is every time you go ahead, say, my body's having internal sex and it's loving it, and I'm going to be younger and vibrant because that's exactly what's happening.\n\n Cellular division causes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (20) Chicken Pox \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nChickenpox\n\n Kids get that, don't they spread it to all the other kids in their class.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a farce?\n\n It's like, do all the roosters bring up the sun because they crow before the sun rises.\n\n\r\nThen if all the roosters die, you wouldn't have a sunrise?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (21) Coconut Cream Juicing \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThe coconut, is that accessible to us\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah?\n\n If you wanna spend $9,000.\n\n The juicer is this big, so we can do 50.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan we rent time on it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nUh, you'd have talk with James?\n\n I sold over it to him.\n\n\r\nHe's now juicing for the lot, so now you can buy coconut cream.\n\n \r\nSo, coconut cream is now available at the lot.\n\n That big machine also juices vegetables, so he will be able to juice vegetables in 1/16th a time that it used to take it.\n\n So, he can do like probably about 10 gallons an hour with the coconut cream and with juice he could probably do about 30 gallons an hour.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nHow do they open the coconuts.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI bought a machine that has a wheel with teeth on it and a pin that sticks up, and what you do is you put it near one of the eyes and it just rips it right off?\n\n \r\nThe people in Thailand who are used to doing that, they can shell a coconut in three to four seconds.\n\n Takes me about 10 to 15 seconds to rip- well, no, Thursday, before last I was down to about probably probably 10 seconds per coconut, ripping the shells off.\n\n And then there's a grinder which grinds it all into grated coconut, and then that goes to the juicer and the juicer is huge.\n\n\r\nIt's like this long, this high, about this wide.\n\n It looks like a, a champion juicer that's stainless steel and huge.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nWhen will it be available for sale.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's already available for sale.\n\n\r\nSo, it's $12 a pint, but that's in glass.\n\n\r\nThey only put it in glass.\n\n He could save a dollar and a half by putting in plastic, but let me tell you, it's better to have it in glass.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (22) Cotton. Wool, Silk \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDo we wear 100% cotton\n\n Is that what we're supposed to do?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n100% cotton or silk?\n\n Wool is difficult for some people, very difficult for some people to break down.\n\n Bamboo's very difficult because they have to use a fiber, just like with rayon when they use pine needles.\n\n They use a polymer to glue it together.\n\n Plastic.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nWhat about them hemp.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHemp's the same way?\n\n Also, you have those fat molecules that dry out in our system.\n\n No, not a good thing.\n\n All natural is not really all natural.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhere are we shopping at now then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nEverything I gets Territory Ahead, but now their women's division, half of the stuff is no longer cotton?\n\n Some of the stuff for men is no longer cotton, but Territory Ahead used to be 100% cotton, two years ago, but I still get everything's 100% cotton from them.\n\n\r\nThey're not organic cotton, but they get their cotton from a better source.\n\n\r\nThey do sell polyester material mixes, so you have to look and see what's all cotton and all not.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo there's a website called the green loop.\n\ncom.\n\n\r\nThey sell organic cotton.\n\n It has great men's and women's clothing.\n\n They also have shoes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThere are several websites that also do that, but if you want to be in style and fit and still want cotton, you are not gonna go to those companies.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (23) Cream For Athletes \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nSome athletes have problems digesting the cream near a sport time, so that can bog them down, also make them sleepy\n\n So, it's hard to camouflage it without the extra cream in it, cream and honey.\n\n It's a good thing to utilize, but sometimes it causes sleepiness, so you have to, you have to be careful.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (24) David Wolfe \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThat whole raw food thing\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, I've only seen eight who survived without that kind of thing?\n\n David Wolf is just now seven years into his.\n\n But you know, all the super foods he's creating.\n\n \r\nTon of stuff, just so he doesn't demineralize.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nHe doesn't eat any dairy.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n No?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nJust straight vegetables and fruit.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMost of those people foam will foam at the mouth?\n\n\r\nWhen my book first came out in 1997, I went to a health convention in San Diego.\n\n This is in 1998, the book came out in the fall of 1997.\n\n So, I was sitting down there and a lot of these people knew me from when I was a fruitarian, and now I was a Renegade fruitarian, eating all this meat and dairy.\n\n\r\nSo, they were charging against me and I'm sitting there very calm and there were five of them and then another came 6 and another came 7, and they were around me for about an hour and a half.\n\n They were intense about it, and when you get that intense when you're a fruitarian, you will actually start foaming at the mouth\r\nYou will actually start producing this white substance that comes off the lips, so basically foaming at the mouth.\n\n And I said, \"Now you tell me that eating meat will make me violent.\n\n I'm sitting here very calm this whole time in the conversation with you\".\n\n I knew this was gonna happen, so I brought a mirror with me and I said, \"You take a look at your mouth, tell me who's not in control and who's not calm\".\n\n\r\nAnd what's likely to make you angry.\n\n Fruit made me very high strung and easy to anger, meat makes me calm and relax.\n\n And then they stood there all dumbfounded, and walked away and I never heard from them again.\n\n That was seven years ago, and David Wolf had just joined them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (25) Detox, Brain Toxins, Cellphones \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI wanted to ask you about detoxification pertaining to clogged up nose, perspiration, headaches, face on fire\n\n \r\nI'm new on the diet and I'm doing very.\n\n I'm experiencing these and I wonder if these are all detoxifications.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAnything that's uncomfortable is a detoxification.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nLike right now, my face is burning up and it's not from the sun.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour brain and nervous system have the highest mineral concentration.\n\n \r\nWhen they discharge, they discharge out the tongue, the gums and the salivary glands, sometimes tear ducts and ears.\n\n And if that's mercury or some other hot metal that's coming down, it will cause a radical burn or temperature raising in the face.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOkay.\n\n I thought perhaps I was having eye strain, so I bought a higher eyeglass for reading, but I don't know if that's true because I was getting headaches while I was reading.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAlso, cell phones can cause those same symptoms.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, the headaches are from detoxifying.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, but then it's from discharging high radioactivity from the head?\n\n So, wear an earbud.\n\n Do you use a cell phone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOnce in a while?\n\n Not a lot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOkay, it's not from that.\n\n It's from your brain discharging poisons.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, it's not eye strain from the headaches.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (26) Divirticultis \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI can't eat raw nuts because of the little tear in the colon\n\n What's good fiber to replace it with.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay?\n\n She has diverticulitis and the medical profession says that you need to eat a lot of fiber to keep things moving through your body if you have diverticulitis.\n\n That's like saying to somebody who has vertigo to go up onto a house and jump off.\n\n\r\nIf you're eating raw food, peristalsis naturally happens.\n\n If you're eating cooked food, peristalsis stops.\n\n That's why they want you to eat fiber.\n\n Just push things through, or eat a vegetable salad with your cooked meat to push it through it through.\n\n \r\nIf you're eating raw food, peristalsis happens.\n\n Unless you've had a lot of antibiotics in your lifetime and peristalsis is pretty nonexistent and that takes a lot to help things.\n\n\r\nThen you need lots of parasites, need lots of trichinosis, needs lots of bacteria to do all of the work, even to move things through.\n\n \r\nSo, eating fiber is the exact opposite you wanna do because that collects in the diverticuli and causes infection.\n\n \r\nIf you're eating raw food and any particle gets stuck in there, it still has its enzymes to react and it'll move out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, fibers not good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou shouldn't have fiber?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (27) Do People Agree With Aajonus On Bacteria \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLike a few months ago, I was doing hot yoga pretty intensely, and I got a rash, and so I went to a naturopath and he sent me to an MD who declared it staff\n\n And of course, they want to give cortisone shots in the foot, antibiotics, the whole thing.\n\n \r\nAnd I refused everything.\n\n She thought I was totally mental.\n\n But it was after that that I read your book and started to understand your concept that the body uses bacteria to help clean up the toxicity, dead cells and whatnot.\n\n That resonated with me that that made sense.\n\n \r\nI want to know if there are other people that corroborate your findings, if there's other people that agree with you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you read The Recipe for Living Without Disease, you'll see Yale, Harvard, all of them are starting to use viruses and bacterias to reverse diseases.\n\n I cited 18 of them in that book.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, my other question is you mentioned if you cook meat or something, then that it becomes susceptible to harmful bacteria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, the same good bacteria that normally gets rid of dead tissue, rotting.\n\n Leave meat out here, it's going to rot.\n\n If it's in the sun, there are bacterias that are gonna form on it, and start eating away unless the sun bakes it and cooks it and dries it, dehydrates it before anybody can eat it.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, is there such thing as bacteria that- \r\n\n \r\nBacteria will mutate on cooked food.\n\n Then its byproducts are toxic.\n\n Just like the poisons from you.\n\n You have more toxins in you if you eat cooked food.\n\n \r\nIt's like the Pottenger's test of that cat.\n\n What happened when they took the feces from the cooked food animal.\n\n The vines that they grew, they grew beans?\n\n No matter from what animals the feces came, the beans always grew.\n\n It always grew a vine and always produced beans.\n\n \r\nHowever, the foliage on it was very different.\n\n Those animals that ate raw, their feces grew very lush, full leaved plants, vines.\n\n The more processed the food, the feces created 1 - 2 two leaves on a whole vine that would run 10 feet long, not a very healthy plant.\n\n  \r\nSo, the more toxins that you discharge, the bacteria eats in us, the bacteria eats the cooked food.\n\n It discharges more poisons, just like we do, which interferes with other biological process.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, conventional wisdom always says that the immune system needs to be strong in order to fight the bacteria.\n\n So, what does that mean?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's like saying the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (28) Docotors and Celebrities On This Diet \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nShe was responsible for cataloging all the chemicals of the brain and nervous system, Columbia university\n\n So, she was a doctor, but not a MD, but probably there are about 40 MDs on this diet all over the world.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat are their names.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can't give out that information?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nI mean in case you wanna visit the doctor's.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI can't even do that.\n\n They will be ostracized.\n\n \r\nA lot of your movie stars are the same way.\n\n They don't want anybody to know they're on the diet.\n\n The only  two that I know were Mel Gibson and Christina.\n\n They were the only ones that advertise that they ate raw meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre they still on it.\n\n\r\nThey both eat yeah?\n\n He got off and got drunk again, o now he's back on the raw meat again.\n\n That's the way until it gets busted.\n\n  just say frequently.\n\n Am I thing before I, no, just go ahead.\n\n What about.\n\n\r\nWell, the only time I seen parents take it to court when one of the parents took the other parent to court.\n\n That was the only time I've seen it in court.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (29) Does Aajonus Eat Pork \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAs long as the pig has been raised organically, I'll eat pork\n\n I eat pork several times a year.\n\n I'll pig out on it for three, four days in a row.\n\n I just was so hungry for it.\n\n I'll eat it\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (30) Dont Take Antibiotics \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd a broken bone and they said they wanted to put antibiotics in my IV and I refused\n\n I told 'em, I'd take 'em orally.\n\n So, he gave me the antibiotics to take and guess what I didn't take.\n\n Because I don't need that, I can take lime juice or something if I want to keep bacteria down, and I don't want to deal with a bacterial detoxification or infection right after a period of medical help because they just freak out when it happens?\n\n \r\nSo, I just avoided all those chemicals.\n\n However, as I was going to sleep, I did see the anesthesiologist pumps some antibiotic into the IV and I was already half gone and couldn't say anything and that's what this is.\n\n \r\nSo, I had constipation up until yesterday.\n\n So, finally it cleared my system, but I ate tremendous amounts of cheese.\n\n I ate a whole loaf of cheese in 10 days.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (31) Dyes From Cat Scan Stay In Body Lifetime \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNot only that, it will stay in your body a lifetime, unless you know how to get rid of it\n\n \r\nIf you have an x-ray, certain kinds of x-rays, cat scans, they put a dye in you of barium, which is a toxic mineral that's radioactively charged, can be radioactively charged or iodine, which can be radioactively charged.\n\n\r\nOnce they're charged, they live for 58,000 years.\n\n Anybody gonna live that long.\n\n Then you need to get it out of the body?\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (32) Eating Bugs \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAre bugs healthy to eat\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes they are, and these, these little bugs, if you eat them, they taste like a little sugar droplet?\n\n Very sweet.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThey are.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAre you serious.\n\n \r\najonus]\r\nVery serious?\n\n They're very sweet.\n\n I eat them all the time.\n\n They stopped buzzing me.\n\n\r\nI just catch them like that and then eat them and they're very sweet, just like a sugar droplet.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (33) Ecoli Part Of Digestive System \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIn one of your lectures, you talk about how you'll say E coli killed someone or whatever, and you joke because E coli is a bacteria that we have in our intestines\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey got away with that bullshit for 50 years, and then when they got enough people educated and people realized, wait a minute, E coli is the major part of my bacterial system in the colon.\n\n So, then they came up with the 87157 E coli mutation.\n\n Where does a mutation like that come about.\n\n Only from industrial poisons?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (34) Egg Allergy, Detox \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNobody's really allergic to the egg itself, unless they're eating it cold and eating it with other food\n\n So, if you're eating an egg alone, you'll never have an allergy to it as long as it's room temperature.\n\n \r\nWell, sometimes what happens is the body will use the liquid protein and the liquid fat to have a liver, gallbladder, pancreas, detoxification.\n\n\r\nIf that happens you might have diarrhea.\n\n You might have some cramping or vomiting that'll occur, but is not from the egg directly.\n\n It's what the body's utilizing the fat and proteins for, the detoxification.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (35) Eggs & Cabbage Juice For Ulcers \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's gonna cause more problems\n\n What she needs to do is eat eggs and cabbage juice together.\n\n Stinky nasty farts, but that's okay.\n\n They'll leave her alone in the military, but that'll help seal up the ulcers.\n\n\r\nWhat she could do is drink about a half a cup of green cabbage.\n\n It has to be green, not the red green.\n\n Green cabbage juice with 1 or 2 eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (36) Eggs and Milk For Respiratory Problems \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWhat's your symptoms\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLungs, lots of phlegm, coughing, weakness the body, loss of air and hard to breathe?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, but you could be just detoxing through the lungs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe's diagnosed with it.\n\n He's on a prednisone.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt'd be too hard for me to diagnose something like that without seeing the person, seeing the condition, I'd be guessing.\n\n\r\nAnytime anybody has any respiratory problems, the things that they can do before they come and see me is suck eggs, 25 to 30 eggs a day, just suck eggs all day long.\n\n Best way.\n\n Remember, in eggs the protein and fats are all liquid.\n\n Very little digestion, less digestion than with milk.\n\n Milk is twice as complicated to digest as a milk.\n\n\r\nThe only problem is when you eat eggs alone like that, it causes weight loss.\n\n So, you have to have some milk at night before you go to bed and milk during the middle of the night, just to keep the weight on.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (37) Eggs Before Surgey \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, I let them put me under, and that means an IV\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, take bee pollen.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes, it does, but I took it before and after, and they said no food after 12 o'clock?\n\n I was sucking eggs every hour up until two hours before surgery because remember eggs, there's no solid to it.\n\n It's going to all be absorbed and you don't have to worry about it.\n\n \r\nThey're looking at people who eat cooked foods and water and all that kinda stuff.\n\n It never assimilates and processes properly, so they're vomiting, defecating on the operating table and that they don't want.\n\n So, it's not a problem if you're eating raw foods, especially raw eggs because all the protein and all the fat is already liquid.\n\n \r\nI had my last pain formula with cheese and the bee pollen, everything about 5:00AM  \r\nSo, from 5:00AM until 11:00AM, I had nothing other than eggs.\n\n No water, nothing but eggs.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (38) Eggs Dotn Regenerate Cells \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEggs do not deliver the amino acids that will allow you to regenerate growth hormone\n\n The protein and fats in the egg can be utilized to regenerate cells that are already alive, but they do not increase cellular division, only raw meats do.\n\n\r\nSo, if you want to stay as old as you are and not get younger, eat eggs.\n\n\r\nIf you don't want to increase your cellular production, get stronger and healthier and heal more, eat eggs.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYou're not going to build muscle.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou'll build some muscle, but it'll be just muscle that will grow very gradually?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (39) Eggs With Milk \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's more complicated to digest eggs that are mixed with other foods\n\n  \r\nBut people who need to create more mucus, they need to have eggs mixed with dairy and butter or cream to have more mucus.\n\n  \r\nEggs will not create mucus on their own, has to be mixed with the dairy.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, you'll dry out.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (40) Electroyltes \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust put honey and lemon juice or lime juice with it\n\n Also, grapefruit juice is the quickest way to re mineralize electrolytes.\n\n So, whey, grapefruit juice, little lemon honey in that, you make it sweet and delicious.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nOh, you put grapefruit into the whey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGrapefruit, lemon juice, lime juice, and honey into the whey?\n\n\r\nThat'll also help them break down uric acid, byproduct of muscle metabolism.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (41) Endometriosis and Eggs Wont Regen Cells \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nEndometriosis is the utilization of cells that don't normally belong in one place in another\n\n It happens in everybody because, um, we don't have enough protein in the diet in the form that can be utilized.\n\n So, everybody has endometriosis, it's only used Endometriosis relating with ovarian cells.\n\n \r\nSo, if you have ovarian cells that are utilized somewhere else in the body, that's the general medical term.\n\n  \r\nWhen the woman has her period and she goes into cramps, those cells that are ovarian cells that are not in the ovary will go into the cramping also, and that causes severe pain outside of the ovarian area depending upon where.\n\n \r\nI knew one woman that had ovary cells in her brain.\n\n Every time she went into her period, she had a spot in her brain that gave her cramping.\n\n \r\nAnother woman who had it in her elbow, she was a tennis player.\n\n She was such an avid player that her body was very low on protein and nutrients and started borrowing cells from other areas of her body and putting it in her left elbow.\n\n  \r\nSo, then when she had her period, her elbow had a period.\n\n So, endometriosis isn't only related to ovarian, but that's where it's used most commonly because people can identify.\n\n \r\nThey can't tell if you've got an elbow cell in your uterus.\n\n No way to tell.\n\n They can tell if the area goes into aa spasm on a regular cycle with your menstrual cycle, you have ovarian cells in that area.\n\n  \r\nYour body will borrow cells from any kind of an area and utilize them anywhere in the system.\n\n To reverse it, you just have to eat enough meat to replace cells that are localized, eat enough raw meat.\n\n So you reproduce cells, so cells will divide, not just regenerate.\n\n That's why meat is so necessary.\n\n Eggs won't do it.\n\n Eggs will help those cells that are already alive become healthier, but if you want to help cells increase.\n\n  \r\nIf you wanna help cellular division speed and increase, you have to eat meats.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (42) Fluoride In Concentration Camps \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI had read that the Nazi's not used fluoride in the water in the concentration camps\n\n  \r\nIs that true.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYes?\n\n Fluoride is the smallest molecule in the world.\n\n It can penetrate and enter anywhere.\n\n It's a byproduct of mainly military machinery, military industrial complex.\n\n That's why it gets into government programs because the military needs to get rid of it and they don't want to build huge storage places to hold it underground.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, how do you get rid of fluoride then.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou drink water that has fluoride?\n\n You don't drink tap water ever.\n\n \r\nSo, you drank the water, so it's in your body.\n\n Removing that takes cheese, lots of cheese over your whole lifetime.\n\n \r\nBecause the government wants to get rid of it.\n\n It's a marketing tool to get rid of it.\n\n They use the tests from Massachusetts.\n\n Do you know what those tests were.\n\n The children had less cavities who had the fluoride because they were losing teeth?\n\n So, they had less teeth to have fillings in them.\n\n \r\nSo, they had less fillings because they had teeth that were falling out and they used that as the barometer that fluoride is good for them.\n\n These government people are not nice.\n\n Even your good Senator is on the wrong side of the fence as a matter of necessity.\n\n He does the best he can, unless he's a Republican, then he does the worst he can.\n\n \r\nIf you're like Reagan, you're gonna rob the till as long as you're in office, and every Republican robs the till every time they're in office.\n\n How many trillions of dollars are we in debt.\n\n When Clinton left office?\n\n, we were $6 trillion in the black.\n\n Bush Senior left $4 trillion deficit.\n\n Now we're $8 trillion in deficit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (43) Gettign Athletes To Eat Raw \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've got two pre-teens that are real active in sports and not eating raw, but I wanna try to- I don't know if you have any suggestions for getting kids into healthier diet\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I always get them by telling them a story?\n\n There's a 14.\n\n5-year-old that was forced to come to me and go on the diet when her mother and father divorced and the mother was very ill and she decided my children are gonna go on it with me.\n\n \r\nSo, she put her 14-year-old on it.\n\n Now the 14-year-old was a B+ student.\n\n She also wanted to be a dancer.\n\n In one year of being forced to be on that diet, she went from a B+ student to an A+ student, plus became the top dancer in 1 year on the diet.\n\n T \r\nhat young girl, that 15.\n\n5-year-old came to me on her own free will the next year.\n\n \r\nI tell them that story and they want to be the head.\n\n They want to be smarter; they want to be better in the sport.\n\n This will give it to them.\n\n This will deliver them the ability to do that.\n\n So, it's really easy to sucker in sports athletes, easiest people to get into this diet as far as teenagers.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDo they need vegetable juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt depends upon the toxicity level, but usually anybody under 16 should not have vegetable juice because it over alkalizes the system and it lowers their growth hormone level?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nFor a teenager, if they're not willing to, how do you fool them.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI would give them milkshakes, things that are they'll eat easily and just hopefully your example will lead them into eating meat?\n\n \r\nIf not, they're their own people.\n\n They're gonna go their own way, whether you like it or not, they are not you.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo under 16, you shouldn't have any juices like carrot or celery or anything.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCarrot's okay, but celery?\n\n parsley, things like that.\n\n Not too much of.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n \r\nWhat would be the most important thing for them because we've been putting the raw milk into the regular milk carton and dumping the regular milk.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI have a lot of parents who do that, and that's a good thing.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (44) Go To Doctor To Put Bones Back In Place \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSo, there are situations where this diet cannot help you and you will have to have medical help\n\n Like if you break a bone and you're dislocated and you can't get that bone back in place, go to a doctor.\n\n  \r\nNow I broke seven bones in my foot, but never went to a doctor because I found a little 14-year-old girl who used to love to crack people's knuckles.\n\n She'd just go around and pick you up and go snap, snap, snap, snap.\n\n She just loved doing it.\n\n So, when I broke all those bones in my foot, right foot.\n\n  \r\nWhat I did was I went out very early, I was in the desert and riding my bicycle and somebody left a sprinkler on all night, so they had a slick algaeic spot near the curb, and I went from the curb and the wheels were right out from under me, so my toes caught on the curb.\n\n Each toe out, so it split the bottom one an inch and a half in, broke the bones here and in the toes, seven breaks.\n\n  \r\nSo, I went to her and she set them all, so I didn't even have to go to a doctor for that, but this, there's no way it was going to leave my body.\n\n The walls he showed with a scope growing up in there, the walls of my bladder are usually smooth.\n\n They were.\n\n lumpy, like the stone that was in it looked like coral.\n\n So, there's some cases when you just have to go to a doctor, and that's in case of kidney or bladder stones, ruptured or inflamed appendix that might ruptured.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (45) Goat Milk Vs Cows \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWould you recommend goat milk over cow milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOkay, difference between goats milk and cows milk?\n\n Goats produce a lot of proteins and hormones that cause hormone precursors for adrenaline.\n\n If you are a thin person, you should not look at goats milk.\n\n Stay away from goats milk.\n\n \r\nIf you are overweight, goats milk is fine, goats milk is fine.\n\n If you have a sugar problem, if you're diabetic, goats milk is wonderful.\n\n \r\nCows milk is always the best, calms nerves and relaxes.\n\n Has anybody ever heard or seen of a relaxed goat.\n\n\r\nThey eat everything?\n\n They, these poor creatures are so imbalanced in life, they eat everything.\n\n They will eat your fence, they will eat rock, they will eat aluminum, they will eat anything that is in their fights.\n\n Anything, absolutely anything.\n\n Poison they will eat, they will eat anything.\n\n Not a good thing to have, unless you're terribly overweight and very lethargic, like most diabetics.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (46) Hair Fall Out During Detox \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nJust remember, when your body's detoxifying, and if it can't find enough fats, it's going to utilize hormones because hormones are made mainly a fats and protein\n\n So, your body is going to use the hormones to discharge, and if it's going to the hair follicles to discard and discharge the heavy metals.\n\n Guess what's going to damage.\n\n\r\nIt's going to damage the follicles and then you may not regrow hair if the RNA and DNA are damaged?\n\n \r\nIf fluoride is going out with mercury at the same time, you can better believe that the RNA and DNA will be damaged in the hair follicle, and it will not grow another hair.\n\n\r\nIt could be lead, it could be aluminum.\n\n Usually if there's gray hair involved, it's aluminum, toxic cauterized aluminum from canned foods and other sources where  we get aluminum.\n\n Screen doors with aluminum, that dust, if you breathe that in.\n\n \r\nIt's all cauterized aluminum, and when that discharges, it causes greying and hair loss, but that's usually just temporary.\n\n\r\nGet fat, get fat, get fat, fat.\n\n \r\nWell, for the hair, butter is better.\n\n The moisturizing, lubrication formula is the best thing for that following meat.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nMen going bald?\n\n What causes that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI just said what causes that?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOh, okay.\n\n Even young men.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, yes?\n\n Even young men.\n\n \r\nWhat happened when I had chemotherapy, I lost all my hair.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (47) Headache From Bowel Movement \n \nBowel movements\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, bowel movements, same difference?\n\n\r\nFrom there all the way up to the brain.\n\n Suck an egg right away and eat cheese.\n\n Eat about a teaspoon of cheese to a tablespoon of cheese and then eat an egg right on top of it.\n\n\r\nThat should stop the headache and the toxicity should drop out of the system pretty quickly.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (48) Heart Worms From Vaccines \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nVery normal thing because see, these animals are getting heartworms because of all the injections of vaccines, especially rabies shots that are going to the heart and damaging heart muscle\n\n\r\nThe thimerosal, the mercury and the aluminum and the formaldehyde are damaging heart cells.\n\n Those heartworms are necessary.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (49) High Meat Vs Fecal Matter \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nEating feces is very helpful\n\n \r\nThe bacteria in high meat is predigesting the high meat.\n\n It doesn't really relate to the bacteria that works in your intestines.\n\n However, breaking that meat down into a predigested form helps speed your own bacteria i your intestines.\n\n\r\nSo, it's helpful, but eating shit will deliver the actual enzymes in bacteria that are necessary for your digestive tract.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs there a store here you recommend.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nGo to some Amish farmers, unless you want to kill some gophers?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, when they said eat shit, they were telling you something good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*Laughs* eat shit and die, it isn't true?\n\n Eat shit and live.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (50) Honey For Diabetics, Temp, Protein Digestion \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nif you're have chronic fatigue is goat milk better than cow's milk\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nProbably?\n\n Well, you're on the thin side, so you're gonna have to add cream to it, some cows cream to the goat's milk.\n\n Do you have a question.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSome of the things you're discussing, what is the impact on insulin resistance, blood sugar?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, no, I'm trying to understand specifically what you're asking?\n\n**[Attendee #2],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, some of the areas like more protein, honey- \r\n\n \r\nWhen you say insulin resistant.\n\n What do you mean?\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nHigh blood sugar?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLet me give you an example.\n\n \r\nI have a 72-year-old that went on the diet and she's been taking insulin for 42 years.\n\n I put her on a minimum of a half a cup of a honey a day.\n\n  \r\nYou know what her blood sugar level does after she has honey.\n\n It drops?\n\n That's the way it works.\n\n  \r\nRemember, when the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows the nectar, it creates an insulin-like substance, which converts 90% of that carbohydrate into enzymes for disassembling, which is digesting the proteins and the fats, mainly proteins.\n\n \r\nOnce you heat that honey above 93°, it alters that insulin-like substance.\n\n When the bee gets back to the hive, he vomits it and they're all he's.\n\n**[I'm pretty sure worker bees are actually she's]**\n \r\nHe vomits what is then honey.\n\n \r\nIt's no longer nectar because it's predigested and it is now honey.\n\n So, honey is bee vomit.\n\n Enjoy it.\n\n It has lots of insulin in it, so it takes care of all the insulin needs and it will lower blood sugar levels.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIt helps you heal the pancreas.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nProtein is very necessary to rebuild the pancreas.\n\n The most important nutrient is protein to rebuild a pancreas, so it functions properly.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDoes the honey have to be crystalized.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nit should not be crystallized?\n\n \r\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n Eggs or meat will help rebuild it.\n\n \r\n93°.\n\n \r\nIt's as long as the pancreas is not producing the proper insulin to regulate the sugar levels \r\nJuice will raise the blood sugar level because you have to have the insulin to help utilize those sugars properly.\n\n \r\nWell, that's okay if it's crystallized, but if you're a diabetic, it'd be better not to have too much crystallized honey.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) How Much Honey With Cheese \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIt's just a small amount of honey\n\n If you have a tablespoon and a half of cheese, it's only a teaspoon of honey.\n\n That's the ratio.\n\n Now there are three teaspoons to a tablespoon, so that's like four to one, four teaspoons of cheese to one teaspoon of honey.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou're feeling better today.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nTwo days after, I was at the lot juicing coconuts with that big machinery that I bought from Thailand?\n\n \r\nThey kept a catheter in me for two days, so I had the catheter out, an hour later I was at the lot juicing, worked for hours.\n\n\r\nI wouldn't say I was painless.\n\n I was in pain, but it wasn't enough to cause me to cry.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWould a cube of cheese, which is about an ounce or something, would that be less than a teaspoon of honey.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHalf a teaspoon is about a sugar cube sized amount?\n\n\r\nSo, two sugar cube sized amounts of cheese is about a teaspoon.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (52) How To Detect Kidney Stones \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, what they can do is they do a sonogram, they do ultrasound and they can see if there's a stone there\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSo, you can ask them to do that without being in pain or being dying or whatever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYes, absolutely?\n\n You can go have it checked.\n\n In fact, after what I went through, if anybody has ever had any kind of difficulty urinating and it's a pattern, go have it checked because it's noninvasive, it's just an ultrasound.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nBut it also be caused by kidneys too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nKidney stones?\n\n That you'd have to have surgery for that because it can't go all the way up to the urethra through the bladder and to the kidney.\n\n They have to go through microscopic surgery through the stomach, but still you want them removed because I've discovered that some skin cancer is caused by stones.\n\n Obviously in me, I started developing skin cancer.\n\n I'm constantly arresting, except for this one right here, but as soon as that stone was removed, my body's processes were restored.\n\n\r\nThat tumors started just shriveling and shrinking and drying up.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nIs that related to a prostate problem too.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, no?\n\n Well, if the prostate is so tight like mine was, my urethra was so small and so tight going through the prostate hat I wasn't able to empty or I probably could have emptied, but my mother taught me to be impatient, even with myself.\n\n\r\nSo, as soon as the flow was gone, I stopped the urination, and then I left about an ounce, maybe an ounce and a half of urine in my bladder, and then stones will start forming, crystals will start forming from the minerals in the urine.\n\n If most people let your urine sit in a jar for about three or four days, you'll see crystals forming at the bottom with crystals.\n\n So, that's what happens if you don't empty yourself, so be patient.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (53) Impotency From Not Eating Raw Meat and Fat \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHow long can you hold an erection\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, last night, six hours, all night long?\n\n all night long.\n\n I woke up all night and it was erect every time I awoke, like my old self again.\n\n I like that.\n\n \r\nOh, he is not raw.\n\n \r\n80, 85% of the time, impotency is a matter of not having the raw fats and not having the raw meat?\n\n Lots of people in their 40s and 50s, all the way up to 90 years old have gone on this diet.\n\n, and all of a sudden, my God they're feral again.\n\n\r\nAnd that's mainly the problem, a lack of raw fats and raw proteins.\n\n If they won't do that, they're not even forming the hormones to ejaculate anything.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (54) Instincto Eater \n \n \n \n \n### (55) Insulation \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nI'm wondering if you could say something about insulation, like that's your house\n\n Thermal insulation, I know most houses have got fiberglass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVery toxic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nVersus Styrofoam, and would old Styrofoam, for example, be not as bad as like new Styrofoam.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nNo, because if the heat hits the house, it's going to regas.\n\n Plastic constantly will cause gases to react when heat and cold changes.\n\n\r\nI've studied a little bit of that.\n\n I found that straw bale is very good, straw is excellent, old clothes, old jeans material is a good insulator.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) La Water, Sparkling Water \n \n \n \n \n### (57) Leon Vs Lime Juice \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nRemember lime juice is an antibacterial\n\n Lemon is a fermentation; lemon juice helps break things down.\n\n Lime juice kills things.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you need to get rid of an infection, lime juice is the way to go.\n\n Lemon will not kill an infection; it'll increase detoxification and add to infection.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat if you marinate in lime.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou're destroying all the bacteria in the foods?\n\n Well, it's not good if you're eating that all the time.\n\n  \r\nWell, with your infection here, it's probably good you're doing it all the time.\n\n You have enough bacteria already working for you, you need to lower yours.\n\n So, you're okay that way, but see, you're overweight and that's fine.\n\n \r\nPeople who are thin and children shouldn't be eating it all the time like that, and when you get thin you won't be able to eat it all the time.\n\n It'll be just the contrary to what you should have.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (58) Lime With Coconut Cream \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYou only really need just a little bit\n\n Now, when I did it in the book, it's overkill, that much lime.\n\n I put as little as a half a teaspoon per cup, and it keeps it for a very long time.\n\n In fact, I found that even the less is better, half a teaspoon per cup of coconut cream.\n\n Half a teaspoon of lime juice per cup of coconut cream.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThis is a cup, one cup.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's what I said?\n\n  \r\nNo, the container it comes in is two cups.\n\n That's a two-cup container.\n\n That's a pint container.\n\n Pint jar.\n\n So, you need one teaspoon per jar.\n\n  \r\nIt's better to break it down into smaller jars, unless you're gonna drink it all in one week.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd another thing is you need to have it melted before you can mix it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nUsually this coconut cream does not solidify like the other coconut cream.\n\n This stays soft the entire time.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, you can still mix it through.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can still mix it through?\n\n It's better to blend it and you don't have to worry about it.\n\n \r\nWhen it's in plastic, the plastic gases and causes the coconut to solidify harder.\n\n For whatever reason, the chemistry, I don't know, but that's what happens.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nHow did you blend it if it's in those big wide mouth jar.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou pour it into different jar?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nOh, we have to take it out from there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou have to put it from the big jar into a smaller mouth jar?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nJust to put a certain amount in, I wouldn't put the whole thing in it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou can't put a whole thing in an eight-ounce jar.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nJust half of it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (59) Lower Back Pain, Kidney Stone, Papaya \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nLower back pain, and it seems to be connected to my insomnia\n\n When I manage to get a fair night's sleep, the back pain doesn't seem to be as severe.\n\n It's was not an accident, it's just kind of become chronic over the years.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nLower.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nLower back pain?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou might have kidney stones, so go have that checked.\n\n\r\nThat'd be the first item of elimination.\n\n Next, it would be a lack of fats and proteins to lubricate and clean the back.\n\n If you have problems with your back and it's not stones eating a custard would be helpful every other day.\n\n\r\nEvery day might cause too much detoxification and lower back problems as I said in my book.\n\n\r\nSo, eating papaya helps clean the spine.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (60) Lyme Disease \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLet's say he got stuck by a nail, they would've blamed it on the nail\n\n They would blame it on anything other than what's in the body causing the problem.\n\n \r\nThink about it.\n\n A tick bites you.\n\n You you've got all kinds of red, white blood cells there attacking any kind of foreign substance.\n\n That's what the little redness is and the blister and all the pus, 95% white blood cells.\n\n Whatever contamination, 95% of that has been decontamination by those white blood cells.\n\n \r\nWhat the hell's going to get over and take over a body in a few weeks from one bite of an animal give me a break.\n\n The science is there, don't be stupid.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, what is malaria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nMalaria is a body dumping from the liver, and usually the pancreas into the bloodstream?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHas nothing to do with the bugs.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo?\n\n That can add to the detoxification.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhen they kill all of the mosquitos, they claim there's less malaria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey always claim shit like that.\n\n Remember when they claimed less Polio.\n\n When the Polio vaccine came out, the graft on Polio was way down at the bottom?\n\n 1958 when they told you to take it, guess what shot up.\n\n All the way up here, that quickly in one year?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nBut the idea of the Explorer going into the rain forests on Africa and getting malaria, that's just what happens when we have a detoxification.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, that's a detoxification causing liver and pancreatic detoxification.\n\n \r\nIt's the climate, the body's not used to that high heat, the moisture, the bacteria naturally being able to grow and, and thriving.\n\n We're here in pollution.\n\n We inhale this antibiotic every day of pollution.\n\n \r\nWe eat this pollution.\n\n It poisons the body.\n\n The bacteria can't work.\n\n We can never detox.\n\n Then you go down into a jungle where there's clean air and there's moisture and there's oxygen, and everything's alive.\n\n All of a sudden, the body's gonna start cleaning itself because you look when you don't go through that shit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (61) Lymphatic Bats, Walks, What Time \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n \r\n\n \r\nRegarding lymphatic baths that you have me on every three to four days\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe next day.\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nNot tonight, but the next day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNot unless you are working and you can't do it the next day.\n\n \r\nBut it's always better to do it in the afternoon.\n\n If you look in the We Want To Live, the new primal diet version under lymphatic congestion, you'll read about lymphatic baths and taking the lymphatic baths.\n\n I always suggest that it be done in the afternoon, so it doesn't disturb sleep at night.\n\n \r\nAnd what the idea of that all of the cooked oils that you had, the Crisco, the margarine, all that garbage you were fed as a child hardens in the body, locks the lymphatic system.\n\n It takes the body's temperature, 101.\n\n6° and higher to 105° to melt that, to be able to make it liquid, to move it and get it out of the system again.\n\n \r\nAnd I suggest that people do that at a certain time of the day, so they don't disrupt their sleep patterns.\n\n And that's sometime in the afternoon, not in the evening.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut with my bath, it's different because you said anytime I have to take it cause it doesn't disrupt my sleep.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's not the lymphatic bath.\n\n \r\nLymphatic baths run from hour to an hour and a half, staying at a hot temperature from 60 to 90 minutes, it's a long time and a hot bath.\n\n You come out like a wet noodle and then you have to take a 45-minute walk 10 minutes after that, bundled up and hot, but it's a slow walk.\n\n \r\nYou could walk like this, I don't care.\n\n I don't care what you look like.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nI don't think I can do that.\n\n Has anyone ever physically done that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, yeah?\n\n I have a 72-year-old man who had prostate cancer and was basically on his way out, and for doing that for three months, he's a new man.\n\n \r\nHe's pleasing his 40-year-old wife.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat was temperature.\n\n 105°?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\n101?\n\n6° to 105°, it's all in the book.\n\n Tells you how to do it, what to eat with it and everything.\n\n**[Fred]**\n \r\nIf you're already detoxing a lot, would you still do that or would it be better to wait till you're not.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWait till you're not detoxifying something else, unless the lymphatic system is the thing that's detoxifying, you can help it?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (62) Margelins Disease \n \n**[2006],[Kathy]**\n\r\n\n\r\nHe has Morgellons disease\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nMorgellons disease is a so called a new disease where they find that fibers are passing through the skin with a parasite, a microscopic parasite.\n\n Guess what those fibers are.\n\n\r\nSynthetic material fibers?\n\n It's finally hit and coming out, people are so toxic.\n\n They're not able to break it down to the lungs, so the body's passing the entire fibers completely through the tissue and a parasite is transporting it, eating its way and carrying it through.\n\n \r\nThey haven't put it all together yet.\n\n They say we have these fibers in this parasite.\n\n Oh my God! No reason for it, and the answer is very logical.\n\n This parasite is eating its tissue all the way through to past this huge, it's like having a bunch of electrical line attendants as you're passing a whole house on a trailer through the streets and you have to disassemble the wires as you go through and then reassemble them after you get it through a certain part of the street.\n\n Well, the parasites are doing that for you to get them through.\n\n Stop wearing synthetic material.\n\n Some people's digestive systems are so poor that they can't even get wool through the system, and that's passing through the skin too.\n\n\r\nOur state of health is terrible when we can't even break down hair protein and get them out of our system if we inhale them and breath them, very frightful state of health that our society is in.\n\n And the people on this diet are the only ones who are going to be resistant and healthy enough to pass through and watch everybody else pass out and go on the wayside with serious disease, serious debilitating things.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (63) Meat and Lube Formula For Weight Gain, Meat Makes U Younger \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nPeople who eat lots of raw meat with, let's say a lube formula like Lucky here\n\n I mean, when he first came to me, he was very, very skinny and he never didn't have any muscles at all in his body.\n\n He'd been on the diet about two years and he says, \"Can I weight lift on this diet.\n\n\" You didn't know I had that good of a memory, did you?\n\n \r\nHe said, \"Can I weight lift on this diet?\n\n\" And I said, \"Yeah, just eat a pound of meat and a lubrication formula\"?\n\n And for women that's the moisturizing formula after each meat meal, do that twice a day and you'll blow up, and they all accused him of taking steroids and all kinds of other protein powders.\n\n \r\nAnd he says, \"No, I was just eating raw butter or raw eggs and raw meat\".\n\n They wouldn't believe them, and look at him/ \r\nWell, maybe the women don't, but that's a gentleman who wants muscles.\n\n \r\nSo, if you wanna pump up, you need the meat to do it if you want to get large.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (64) Menopause Is A Change Of Hormones \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThere's nobody that goes through it more than women in menopause because like I said in the book, women who are going through menopause, it isn't the cessation of hormones\n\n It is a change of the type of hormones that's being produced, and that's a great healing stage.\n\n \r\nMen go through a different kind of menopause and it's a detoxification.\n\n Whereas women at the same time, go through a healing stage.\n\n It's a very comfortable thing, a very happy thing, not comfortable, but the happy thing for women to go through.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (65) Mercury Experiment, How To Get Rid Of \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nNow, as an experiment, I stopped eating swordfish for a year to see if my mercury levels would drop\n\n I'm still at a 4.\n\n9.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nIs that good.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, 4?\n\n9 is bad.\n\n You're supposed to have 0.\n\n01.\n\n I got a 4.\n\n8 - 4.\n\n9.\n\n What I did was I had seven analyses done just to measure different sides of my scalp, parts of my scalp, to see where there was the most mercury.\n\n  \r\nOf course, back here, and here were the most mercury and the sides in the back, up on top there was lower amounts of mercury, but back here, around here, head up to a 5.\n\n1 and up on top as low as a 4.\n\n6.\n\n  \r\nSo, mercury, just remember every vaccine that you've ever gotten, there was 76 zillion molecules of mercury 76 zillion molecules of mercury.\n\n Did anybody count that.\n\n Nobody could count that in their whole lifetime, could not count to 76 zillion?\n\n**[Lewis]**\n \r\nZillion's not a number.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's right.\n\n That's why I used to say 760,000 thousand trillion molecules of mercury is 76 billion, but you can find zillion in a dictionary.\n\n**[Lewis],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nBut it means a lot! \r\n\n \r\nYes, but it means beyond a million.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat's the best way to get mercury out.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCilantro, dark berries, any kind of squash juice, coconut cream?\n\n Coconut cream dissolves it quicker and better than anything else.\n\n Cheese, cilantro, berries help remove it from the body.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, your levels are much higher because you've been on the diet a long time.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah.\n\n That's right, but you have to understand each vaccine has that many molecules of mercury, it will take five lifetimes to get rid of all of it, and my body discards it 5% at a time, at all times, never goes above a 5.\n\n 2.\n\n So, that's safe for me, for somebody else a 2.\n\n1 could be bad.\n\n But for me, I can tolerate up to a 5.\n\n2 without symptoms.\n\n  \r\nChlorella helpful to remove it also.\n\n Chlorella's not digestible, chlorella is an algae.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (66) Mercury In Kidney Stone \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAfter I had the stone taken, I said to my doctor, \"Now I want some of that fluid that you have after breaking that soup, I wanted to analyze it\"\n\n He said, \"Oh, we'll analyze everything\".\n\n And I said, \"Okay\".\n\n So, I got an analysis back that I had no tumors, no cancer.\n\n I said, \"What about what the stone was made of.\n\n\"\r\nThat's what I want to know what that was?\n\n \"Oh, well, we didn't have that examined.\n\n\" I simply then give me the fricking stuff so I can examine it myself.\n\n So, I examined and it was one quarter, 25% mercury.\n\n 25% mercury, and it was a liquid mercury from vaccines.\n\n Only can come from vaccines in that form.\n\n\r\nSee, they're not gonna test for the important things.\n\n What caused that stone.\n\n Of what was that stone made?\n\n No, zeolites wishful thinking again?\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (67) Military Is Terrible \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWhere the fuck are the Russians\n\n They never made it here?\n\n It's a ploy to keep the military in business.\n\n Eisenhower, probably the only sensible president we've had this last 100 years.\n\n Listen, he was a general, a five-star general, nd do you know what he said.\n\n  \r\nOur worst enemy is the military industrial complex?\n\n You cannot plan for war and expect peace.\n\n This came from a general who lived war, who lived defense.\n\n \r\nForget that whole concept.\n\n Immune system, forget it.\n\n It's an absurdity.\n\n \r\nAs you eat bacteria, you become equipped to commingle with them, to work symbiotically with them.\n\n It isn't a war thing.\n\n It's like saying I marry you because you're, a man and I don't like men.\n\n I like women, but I'm going to marry you because I wanna be a strong asshole.\n\n I mean, hello.\n\n Hello?\n\n \r\nIs that the way you wanna spend your life, preparing for the things that you don't like.\n\n \r\n?\n \n \n \n### (68) Milk and Blood Unrefridgerated Has Growth Hormones \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYes\n\n As long as milk is unrefrigerated and straight from the animal and you drink it, the growth hormone factors are not altered \r\nOnce it's refrigerated, it does the same thing.\n\n  \r\nWell, you could have the milk and the blood together mixed and sitting for days and it would still be active as long as you don't refrigerate it or the temperature doesn't fall and drop it below about 70°.\n\n \r\nIt obviously doesn't work all that well for very long because the Messai don't like doing it.\n\n They do it three months a year when the calves are suckling from the cows, so they don't have enough milk.\n\n So, what they do is they bleed a bull and they mix half blood and half milk, but as soon as the calves are not suckling anymore, they stop eating the blood and go right back to the milk.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nYou suggest leaving milk out for five hours.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI leave mine out for 24 hours?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs the issue with fermentation or the temperature that you were talking about.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIf you drink cold milk, it contracts the stomach, you don't secrete hydrochloric?\n\n The milk moves into the duodenum and casein and lactase will get into the blood undigested.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nRegardless of how fermented it is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, if it's already predigested, that's fine?\n\n So, you can take your predigested milk and put.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (69) Mineral Supplements \n \n**[2006],[Lewis]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf I understand, sometimes like 10 minutes before a meal, you can eat just a little bit of cheese, but for a snack, you have to have it with honey\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI wouldn't say as a snack you have to with honey.\n\n If you want to absorb the minerals in the cheese, you have to have it with honey.\n\n That is a mineral supplement.\n\n \r\nPeople sell you mineral supplements, you're eating rock.\n\n You could do better by eating dirt than you will assimilating any kind of rock in those tablets or in powder form.\n\n It's also poisonous.\n\n Those minerals are what trees and plants eat.\n\n They digest by causing fungus, which is rust, rust breaks down metal, they eat metal.\n\n That's their process, we don't.\n\n That's highly toxic to us.\n\n \r\nRusts are toxic.\n\n The worst-case incidents of disease created by rust is what.\n\n Lock jaw?\n\n \r\nRusts are not for human consumption.\n\n So, every time you take a mineral supplement in a tablet form, or powder form, you're eating rock, that is not on our diet.\n\n There are some chairs there.\n\n You can just open them up, open them, open them down.\n\n So, used to those preposition phrases.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (70) Night Sweats, Fever \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nYeah, night sweats are great\n\n Night sweats release a lot of poisons out through the skin.\n\n They're wonderful.\n\n It's also a sign that you're ending the process of a long-term of detoxification.\n\n Cause when the body gets that high in fever, bacteria cannot proliferate, propagate beyond 100° in the human body.\n\n \r\nPlus, your cells stop manufacturing virus.\n\n Remember virus are not alive.\n\n They are protein bodies that destructure tissue, whether it's bacterial or animal cells.\n\n They are just solvents that the cells make they are not alive.\n\n So, the body stops manufacturing solvents as soon as it hits 100°.\n\n So, that's the end of a heavy detoxification and a promotion of healing because once the body hits a 100°, healing is flushed.\n\n  \r\nSo, never wanna stop a fever, unless you wanna get old and dry and wrinkled.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (71) No Milk Mineral Deficient, Detox, Mucus \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nThat's not an allergy to the protein\n\n That means you got something in your brain or sinuses that's dumping, and its usually nerves.\n\n The nerves detoxify at nighttime.\n\n As soon as that sun goes down, nerves start detoxing.\n\n They're in full force by midnight, and it goes full on from midnight till five o'clock in the morning.\n\n \r\nSo, if you're having a response like that, you're having a nerve detoxification and trying to dump through your sinuses, so you need more mucus.\n\n You need to make sure that you're flowing properly to discharge those poison.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAnd you never recommend to not have dairy for a while, and to have only have butter or something.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n You can do that for a little while, but you know, you're gonna lower your mental intake.\n\n You're going to be fasting to some extent for nutrients that are needed in the body.\n\n Because our system, our environment is so toxic with heavy metals that we need a phenomenal amount of minerals to chelate, magnetically attract to them.\n\n Lock onto them, so they don't do damage in the body, and if you're not eating milk and you're not eating cheese, you're going to be mineral deficient.\n\n  \r\nThere is no way we can get enough minerals in our bodies that we can digest and assimilate if we don't eat milk and cheese.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (72) Non Refridgerated Eggs \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nBy themselves Rocky style\n\n Never refrigerate eggs.\n\n If you get your eggs from the store, the only time that that egg is refrigerated is when it's put on the truck for delivery.\n\n No egg company has refrigeration.\n\n No egg grower has refrigeration except on the truck.\n\n \r\nSo, soon it goes out for delivery it has to be delivered to the store at 45°.\n\n So, it's hit 45°.\n\n When you go into the store, the eggs come down to about 36° to 39°, so it's even lower.\n\n  \r\nSo, if you get your eggs from a regular market, find out when the delivery is, and go that afternoon or evening and get those eggs, so they haven't been in.\n\n Because when they unload it at the dock, they're not gonna go into refrigeration for several hours.\n\n People are delivering to these health food stores all the time, so they get to certain things in certain times, and let me tell you, eggs are one of the last things to hit the refrigerator.\n\n \r\nThey're not too worried about them except on the news, and salmonella.\n\n So, just know when they come in and that's when you pick them up.\n\n So, there's very little refrigeration because what happens is the refrigeration destroys the enzymes, which promote growth and digestion.\n\n So, you need to leave them out for 24 hours before they're back up to that bacterial level again, but you can eat them right away.\n\n \r\nJust less digestion, less assimilation, utilization, as long as you're within 24 hours of refrigerating.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (73) Ocean Is Toxic \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWell, like I said, in The Recipe for Living Without Disease, the ocean is 4% toxic, overall, 8%, 8% if you're within a half a mile of a shoreline, unless you're in Japan, and then it's up to 15% waste products within a half a mile of the waterline, the shoreline\n\n \r\nSo.\n\n it all depends on where your fish comes from.\n\n I prefer ocean fish; your fresh water lake fish is 35% polluted minimum.\n\n So, I won't eat anything wild caught from even a river, ocean wild caught deep sea is what I go for, even though the tuna and the swordfish are high in mercury.\n\n I'd still prefer those over the PCBs and everything else that's in the fish that's closer to the shore.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (74) Only 8 Vegans \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI've only met eight people who do it well\n\n One man did it for 47 years and then his spine started deteriorating.\n\n Guess what diet he went on.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWell, my birth certificate says 72, and I'm going to be 30 (years fruitarian) on Monday?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nCongratulations, but it doesn't happen for many people.\n\n Most people demineralize on a fruitarian diet.\n\n \r\nYeah, but out of all the fruitarians that I knew and vegetarians and instinctos, that I know, 98% attrition rate because they couldn't hold onto it because they demineralized their system.\n\n Attrition means they weren't able to stick with the diet.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (75) Parasites Present N Muscle, Dewormers \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI did a test about, uh, 24 years ago\n\n I took a lamb, a very healthy young lamb, and we sterilized him with vinegar, everything natural.\n\n So, we coated it with vinegar, it breaks down bacteria, alcohol, but the natural alcohol.\n\n We sterilized the whole room, the normal way for sterilization, which is steamed the room.\n\n \r\nWe steamed the room.\n\n It was all glass, there was two sides, and we had a pedestal that was also glass and on that pedestal, after I slaughtered the lamb, took a slice of that lamb, completely sterile environment.\n\n Put that slice of lamb, brought down the glass container over it.\n\n \r\nA glass container went over to the outer room and there were three HEPA filters there, so there's no way that any parasite or bacteria could have passed through into that.\n\n That came through to a small room that was about 3x3, and it contained 6 dracaenas, which produce a lot of oxygen.\n\n \r\nSo, oxygen got through clean into that meat, kept that room, the hermetically sealed environment where the meat was.\n\n We kept it at the sheep's body temperature, which was about a hundred, 101.\n\n8°.\n\n  \r\nGuess what appeared in three days.\n\n Parasites?\n\n Parasites and bacteria are a natural product of every animal tissue in this world.\n\n \r\nJust like worms are in the earth.\n\n Let's say your cell is the earth in every cell, in your skin, in every cell, which is soil.\n\n You've got parasites, you've got worms, you've got everything you need to make life ecologically balanced and recycle.\n\n  \r\nSo, your tissue, all animal cells contain parasites, and when you need them, they will flourish.\n\n However, if you're so metal poisoned, they will not survive.\n\n They'll eat tissue and they'll die, it'll kill them.\n\n That's why the medical profession wants to keep poisoning you.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThey wanna get rid of the parasites.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThey don't want you to have parasites.\n\n \r\nThey want you to say, I don't have parasites, I don't have bacteria, I must be healthy, and that's the way they look at it.\n\n But they don't look at the process of those bacteria and those parasites being healthy to get rid of degenerative tissue to make you healthier, and that's what happens.\n\n They make you healthy.\n\n  \r\nIn the animal tests that I did, the animals who had parasites got very well.\n\n The other animals that we gave a dewormer and we dewormed, they stayed lethargic, and when we performed autopsies at their death, they were all very old animals, and we got rid of the parasites of some animals, fed the other animals good raw foods, so they maintained through the parasites, even though they had lethargy and problems for up to six months, one of 'em almost seven months.\n\n \r\nThey all at the time of their death were so much healthier.\n\n Their organs were rich and red and the animals that we gave dewormers and got rid of their parasites, their tissue was black.\n\n So.\n\n all the evidence is there.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nDidn't primitive people use clay and stuff to help get rid of parasites.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, they just helped get rid of the veratoxins that were produced from parasitical activity?\n\n \r\nThey knew the parasites were good, so they ate the clay to help eliminate the discharge, but parasites eat a 100x their weight in 24 hours and discard only 1%.\n\n That's like you eating a hundred pounds of food a day and having a one-pound turd the next day, that's very efficient.\n\n  \r\nMy body only has to handle 1% of waste.\n\n Bacteria eats about 50x their weight in a 24-hour period, but discards about 5% waste.\n\n That's 10% waste on the whole.\n\n So, let's say they're eating 50 pounds and they're having a 5 pound third the next day.\n\n \r\nThat's pretty good.\n\n That's pretty efficient, but still not as efficient as a parasite.\n\n So, I prefer a parasite.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (76) PCBs In Plastic \n \n \n \n \n### (77) Pharmaceutical Drugs Used For Anything \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThey were giving me AZT, and then a year later they claimed it was too toxic to use for cancer\n\n They pulled it out of the vaults when aids came around to get rid of it, no testing at all.\n\n And they said, \"Oh, AZT is good for aids\", just because they want to get rid of it out of the vaults.\n\n Nothing to do with human compassion.\n\n\r\nIf they've got it in their vaults and they've paid for it, they will definitely market it.\n\n It will be marketed eventually.\n\n\r\nYou know that most of these compounds for erections, Viagra and all of those.\n\n These were for heart conditions, mainly created for heart conditions and for bone cancers.\n\n And what they do is create just the opposite, create heart conditions and bone cancers, but they found that everybody was getting an erection.\n\n \r\nSo, now if you read the literature, it says, if you have a heart condition or if you have bone cancer, or if you have bone marrow problem or leukemia or anemia, don't take these.\n\n\r\nThe medication will poison you, but they're gonna market that, they don't care what happens to you.\n\n They've got a product to sell and they're gonna make a fortune on it, until there's so many people that are so sick, then they'll take it off the market and pull something else out of their hat.\n\n\r\nAnd that's the way it goes.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (78) Plastic Too Hot Or Cold Outgasses \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nWell, none of them are good if they're subjective to very cold temperatures or very warm temperatures\n\n They will all gas, whether it's polyurethane or Lexan is the harder plastic that they say is less volatile, but you put anything near heat and anything too cold where it starts to freeze.\n\n\r\nIt breaks down the dioxins and they gas into the food.\n\n Even into water.\n\n\r\nWell, just take the sparkling mineral water and let the gas expire.\n\n  \r\nI had to do that for a while.\n\n I had the same problem.\n\n I just kept getting gassy.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nDo you get milk in plastic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI don't?\n\n That's why I have all these glass bottles.\n\n\r\nI ship them back.\n\n \r\nI don't like anything with plastic.\n\n I get some things with plastic in, soon as I get home, it's out of the plastic.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (79) Poisons Dumping, Eat Cheese \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nThose are symptoms of somebody that's been poisoned\n\n\r\nSo, what happens is every time you eat, especially protein, you start removing the chemical toxicity stored from the poison.\n\n \r\nVaccine poisoning, a lot of military people go through that.\n\n\r\nWhat happens is those chemicals dump from the stomach lining into your food.\n\n\r\nSounds like you have phosphorus in there.\n\n\r\nI only eat fruit that is unripe because the high sugars will turn into alcohol in the digestive tract.\n\n That cause massive detoxification and it lowers the blood fat level.\n\n \r\nThere's not enough fat to bind with the poisons.\n\n You need to eat cheese before you eat.\n\n So, that cheese goes in, poisons will dump from the stomach and esophagus into the cheese and lock into the cheese.\n\n Then you eat your meal.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (80) Polyester \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nNo polyester because that will gas again\n\n Just remember, anybody who's wearing polyester clothing, the lint that comes off of it, you're breathing it.\n\n That goes into your lungs.\n\n Your body has to eat it and digest it, the plastic.\n\n \r\nSo, you're getting PCBs, you're getting polymers.\n\n You're getting all kinds of dioxins.\n\n\r\nLung cancer is gonna be out of this world in the next 20 years.\n\n Probably the worst country that will be hit will be Vietnam because all women wear polyester clothing, all of them.\n\n Men don't, all of the women wear polyester suits.\n\n Looks like they're in the pajamas all the time, polyester pajama.\n\n Yes.\n\n I was just gonna.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (81) Poor Diet, Low Protein, Less Detox and Growing \n \n \n \n \n### (82) Poor Vision Is Red Meat Defiency, Coconuts and Carrot \n \n \n \n \n### (83) Protein Deficiency \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd high meat is the best way or eating fecal matter to infuse the E coli into the system to make sure that the E coli is breaking down the proteins\n\n Now you digest protein all throughout the intestinal tract, as long as you're not too alkaline.\n\n As long as you haven't eating vegetables along with the meat or dairy or eggs.\n\n \r\nYour system will be acidic enough to create the acidic bacteria, and the hydrochloric acids all throughout the small intestines.\n\n So, that by the time you've got the smaller molecule of meat getting into the colon, the E coli can do its job.\n\n 90% of the amino acids that are digested by the E coli, go to the brain and nervous system, some to the glands, but most of it to the brain and nervous system.\n\n\r\nIf you have a problem sleeping it's because of that protein deficiency for the nerves.\n\n So, you always need to eat your meat a little aged or very aged, or eat a heck of a lot of eggs to get that liquid protein in your system that can get down to the E coli.\n\n \r\nNow I've done experiments and I found that six eggs in the average diet will not do it.\n\n Six eggs will not reverse insomnia.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nIs that a day.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat's a day?\n\n It takes 12 to 16 because the protein is all liquid and the white of the egg, the body absorbs, and utilizes it everywhere else.\n\n It takes 12 to 18 eggs to satisfy the body's need for protein even if you're eating meat.\n\n To get to the point where the E coli gets to break some of that egg white down, that protein down for the nervous system.\n\n\r\nSo, if you have insomnia and you're eating meat, you're eating eggs, you're eating dairy.\n\n Then you know you have an E coli problem.\n\n You're just gonna have to down a lot of eggs.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (84) Protein Removes Poisons \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYour body will discard a lot of poisons from proteins\n\n\r\nProtein helps remove poisons and neutralized toxins.\n\n You won't do it without protein.\n\n  So, meat's very important to discharge toxins, but it depends on what the protein is removing from the body, which will determine stickiness or acidic, or tartness that comes out the skin.\n\n What it's carrying, not its nature itself.\n\n\r\nBecause pyruvate only has a byproduct of 7% to 8%.\n\n \r\nWhereas fruit, vegetables, any cellulose, grains, nuts have 70% to 90% carbohydrate byproduct.\n\n Protein has only 7% to 8%.\n\n So, that doesn't cause your stickiness, it's what the protein was removing from your body.\n\n It was sticky.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (85) Rejuvaluc and Fermented Foodsto Detox \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRejuvelac\n\n That's not a bad thing.\n\n Rejuvelac is a good detoxifier.\n\n Just remember anything that you've eaten in your life cooked.\n\n If you eat it fermented and bad with alcohol, it's going to help clean out.\n\n It's going to deliver bacteria and alcohols that are specific to breaking down the products that you've eaten and cooked.\n\n \r\nBecause when you eat something cooked, you've broken down all of the bacteria that naturally clean it out of your system when the body's finished with it.\n\n Then the waste can be removed naturally, that's what happens.\n\n \r\nWhen you cook, you've destroyed all of those natural abilities to break down those substance and eliminate them.\n\n So, if you want to detoxify those substances, you ferment, you've eaten breads all of your life.\n\n\r\nMake Rejuvelac, drink it, but it will detoxify you not heal you.\n\n There's a difference between detoxification and healing.\n\n Healing means you are regenerating cells and getting healthier.\n\n Detoxification is the elimination of toxins from the body.\n\n Rejuvelac helps detoxification, not regeneration.\n\n Not directly regeneration.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (86) Reverse Osmosis Only Removes Minerals \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nReverse osmosis takes out the minerals\n\n It does not take out any of the chemicals.\n\n I want minerals in my water, I don't want chemicals.\n\n So, osmosis doesn't serve me.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (87) Saiva, Blood Alkalinity, Too Much Fruit \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nA healthy pH in the intestines is in acidic reading\n\n So, healthy saliva pH.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nShould always be acid, and urine should always be acid?\n\n Fecal matter should always be acid.\n\n Blood, mine's 5.\n\n5 all the time, so it's acidic.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, basically everything's acidic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, if you're a carnivore, everything should be acidic, but because we are over acidic from eating cooked foods and all the pollution, you need to help alkalize the blood by having some little fruits and vegetable juice to help keep the alkalization a little higher?\n\n  \r\nAlso, the Terramin clay helps that because it will help bind and cheese helps bind and hold onto the acidic, caustic metals that cause all the problems, and helps discharge them through the body.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n \r\nSo, if you have an alkaline saliva pH, does that mean then basically- \r\n\n \r\nThat means you have poor digestion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt means that you're getting too many vegetables or drinking too much vegetable juice.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAbsolutely, or you have diabetes, and the pancreas is not working?\n\n That would cause an over alkalinity.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, a lot of nutritionists that talk about having an alkaline pH are completely on the wrong side.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThose are the ones that are out in Lala land who are trying to be vegetarians or that think that you should alkalanize everything?\n\n \r\nThat came in the 1890s with people like Walker and Eli and those people that thought, \"Oh, well, if we eat fruits, we get cleaner.\n\n So, that means alkaline\".\n\n They just made this correlation that stuck that has no science behind it.\n\n  \r\nThey said alkalizing the system makes people well, because if you eat vegetable juice, you eat fruits, you get healthy.\n\n That's the entire correlation.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nSo, if you have an alkaline pH, you're saying it's due to poor digestion.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, I'm saying if you have an alkaline pH, you will have poor digestion.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, okay.\n\n So, where's the alkaline reading coming from.\n\n If it's a saliva pH alkaline reading, where's the alkalization colonization coming from.\n\n If it's not coming from high content use of vegetables?\n\n How is the pH going alkaline.\n\n What's making it go alkaline?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYou've eaten a lot of alkanalizing minerals that are over on the alkanalizing side in your lifetime?\n\n \r\nA lot of vegetarians will for a very long time have an alkaline pH.\n\n Owanza had an alkalanizing pH for 12 years.\n\n \r\nShe had been a vegetarian for 15 years and she still doesn't digest well because she keeps eating too much fruit.\n\n She still keeps to alkaline, she's hyperactive.\n\n She cannot concentrate for more than 15, 20 minutes, but like me, she was so sick that when you feel the charge and all that excitement, it feels like health compared to that.\n\n \r\nSo, she still embraces all of that hypermanic feeling and activity.\n\n I gave it up because it didn't make me think clearly, and also, I was fanatic.\n\n So, I gave up that high fruit, high alkaline diet because I didn't want to behave that way.\n\n  \r\nShe still embraces it.\n\n She can't sit still for more than 20 minutes.\n\n She can't read for more than a page.\n\n She's too hyperactive.\n\n She's too high up on a level of activity, that isn't where I want to be.\n\n That's where I loved being after being so sick for so long, and I related it to health and a lot of people who get healthy or get hyper eating a lot of fruit, they think that's health.\n\n \r\nThey don't realize that they're demineralizing their body every day, every time they eat a fruit.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (88) Saunas \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nRemember when you're detoxing through the skin, a lot of poisons are coming through the skin\n\n If you're hitting a dry heat or a steam heat, what happens.\n\n You burn it into your skin?\n\n You damage the skin.\n\n If you were in a sauna like that, and every three minutes you went out and took a shower, but then it wouldn't be helpful would it.\n\n\r\nIt's not gonna get into the lymphatic system deep.\n\n You have to be immersed in the water, perspiring into the water, so the water carries the poison right off the skin.\n\n It's the only way to do it safely.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (89) Should U Exercise \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nSince I saw you last time, I've been eating three pounds of butter a week and a pound of meat a day\n\n When I wake up and I look at my cell phone, it's dark.\n\n It looks like I have a magnifying glass.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYour eyesight's getting better.\n\n Your skin is looking a lot better.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nAlso, I've been getting photographic memory.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nGood.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nSo, is weight lifting recommended if you just prefer to be more muscular.\n\n Because I used to like to lift weight?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's all individual.\n\n If you create a lot of hormones for physical activity, you need to exercise, you need to be active.\n\n \r\nDoesn't mean you have to go out and pump weights, just means you need to be active.\n\n Now me, I don't create any hormones for physical activity, unless it's sex.\n\n Those are the only ones that I ever have enacted to spend and burn, and when the right girl comes along, a lot produces just automatically.\n\n \r\nOtherwise, this is my exercise on my computer keyboard, and that's it.\n\n That's all the exercise I do.\n\n Once every two months, or once a month, I stand up in front of people and do this.\n\n Or, you know, if I'm doing a lecture, I will stand one day, every week or two, and this is my exercise.\n\n  \r\nThat's literally my exercise, but other people produce a lot of hormones for physical activity and if they don't utilize that those hormones in physical activity, they're going to go into anxiety and utilize it in anxiety.\n\n \r\nSo, you've got your choice.\n\n Here's two doors, anxiety or activity, which do you choose.\n\n**[Attendees]**\n \r\nActivity?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThe anxiety makes hell with relationships.\n\n Everybody hates you and you hate everybody, but the body's got to utilize them.\n\n It's got to spend those hormones.\n\n So, if you have an anxious body, you better be active and exercise.\n\n \r\nNow I can tell activity circles in the eye.\n\n I call them worry circles.\n\n Other neurologists call them stress rings.\n\n What they do is they tell me is how much hormones you produce for physical activity.\n\n So, when I do someone's health with them, I look at the iris and say, you need to do so much activity a day, and you need to be that active.\n\n  \r\nIf you aren't, you're going to be in anxiety, and that's your sole reason for being in anxiety.\n\n If you like anxiety, knock yourself out.\n\n If you don't exercise, be active, you'll be okay.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (90) Small Pox A Hoaxe \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd Smallpox was rampant according to what I've read\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat's that's a hoax.\n\n They were poisoning the natives' waterholes.\n\n Same thing that the Germans and the Scandinavians did in Brazil.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow did such a big part of the native population die.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPoisoning their waterholes?\n\n Poisonous warfare has been going on since Egypt, we have it

water.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIs there records of this.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThere's some?\n\n The one that I read, the one that they did in Brazil, I can't remember the author's name, but he wrote Savages.\n\n It was about the annihilation of the natives in the jungle by the British and German, it was a play called savages.\n\n**[unclear]**\n in 1971, and through his work, I looked at the rest of his work and he had documentation that showed that Coca-Cola, the diamond in the street, and the German companies were going down paying people in bars, $1,500 a week to poison and murder the Indians and blame it on smallpox.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (91) Stiff Arm From Vaccines \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nDon't know what the core source is, but I've had stiffness in my right arm and did some traveling this summer, pulling luggage, pain increased\n\n I don't know if I tore something or something else was already started and, played tennis in a lot of pain because my ego and ever since then I had, I've had a lot of pain in my arm.\n\n\r\nThe classic tennis elbow, but it's gotten better, but I'm at the point now where it's not getting better, and it swells and flares up.\n\n Can't play tennis or golf anymore.\n\n When I do yoga, I have to be careful in my right arm, and it's not getting better.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's very common, very common.\n\n\r\nLike I said earlier, you get poisons that go into the bone marrow.\n\n She used to be very heavy, very heavy, and she had a lot of fat to protect her.\n\n Then she got on the too thin side for a little while, and what happened was the poison started going into her bone marrow, like I said, a few minutes ago when it exits, it exits a joint.\n\n\r\nAs long as the poison is in the hard bone, it can go out through the muscles, and the tendons, and now through the skin.\n\n But once it gets into the bone marrow, the only exit point is a join.\n\n Poisons go out the joint, they burn the joint.\n\n They cause all kinds of pain and problems, minerals collect, and that's what causes soreness and stiffness.\n\n\r\nWhey is the thing to drink to help break that down and alleviate it.\n\n So, drink a whole cup a day, half a cup at a time, twice a day.\n\n Let's say, somewhere around 11AM and somewhere around 8PM, and then after about 10 days, cut it down to a half a cup, a day, quarter cup in about 11AM and about, uh, quarter cup at about 8PM.\n\n\r\nAnd just keep on that until the pain goes away.\n\n Then if it returns after a few months, and you're still discharging out that joint and you need to keep it up until the pain goes away, until it stops.\n\n It could be 50 years depending upon if you ever got an injection in this arm and the shoulder and the thimerosal and aluminum went into the joint and into the bone marrow through the bone.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nSometimes my entire arm is sore, it's all through into the shoulder.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nThat means it's coming out the shoulder and out the joint.\n\n And when it comes out the shoulder and the joint, what is to come out, what's around the shoulder and joint.\n\n Not a lot of muscles, most of the muscles are down here?\n\n\r\nWhat along here.\n\n Tendon?\n\n So, it has to discharged through the tendons, has to travel all the way down into the muscles before it can get into the lymphatic system, into the connective tissue and out through the skin.\n\n So, you're gonna have a soreness all the way up and down the arm.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nCan a hot water bottle help.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nHot water bottle helps increase circulation and move it faster?\n\n\r\nThe whey will help break down the minerals collecting that causes the stiffness and the soreness.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (92) Sugar With Yeast Infection \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nIn case of vaginitis, is it okay to eat honey in fruits and other things that yeast thrive on\n\n \r\nJust remember that any kind of a vaginitis that is yeast active is breaking down starches in your system, mainly starches, not sugar?\n\n \r\nSo, it's from the old times of eating bread, and peanuts and all the cooked starches that you had, and that is a discharge.\n\n\r\nThe only thing that you can do to help that discharge become easier and less odorific is to implant some coconut cream in a combination with yogurt.\n\n Coconut cream, yogurt and a tiny bit of honey and implant that and leave it.\n\n Once a day, once every other day and let the discharge happen.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (93) Sushi Bars \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nAnd I ask, when I go to a sushi bar, I say, \"Did this come from a fish farm rr did this come from the ocean\n\n\" I always ask?\n\n And they know.\n\n \r\nIf it comes in that day, they will serve it fresh.\n\n If they keep it overnight, the LA restriction is they have to freeze it.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nSo, which place do you recommend.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAll of them get it fresh overnight?\n\n\r\nHowever, I ate at a sushi bar twice last year and got sick both times because they were using MSG on them and I got MSG poisoning twice.\n\n So, I stopped going to sushi bars.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nHe said he knows a guy who runs the sushi plays here in LA, and if this guy told James two sushi joints here in LA, that you have only served fresh fish, he knows for sure that they never serve frozen.\n\n Now you'll have ask James where they are.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI will.\n\n Cause I stopped going sushi bars in this city because of that.\n\n There's a great place in Phoenix, Arizona, I can I get, get a whole platter of raw fish for a $100 that would cost me $600 here.\n\n $100 for a whole platter that it takes 4 - 5 of us to eat this whole platter.\n\n So, for $100, I can feed four people.\n\n Here I can't even feed myself for $100.\n\n I leave a sushi bar hungry.\n\n They're so expensive.\n\n\r\nIt's just outrageous.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (94) Terramin Clay Isnt Cauterized \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n\n\r\nTerramin clay\n\n A lot of people are upset because of the high aluminum.\n\n I tell them that Terramin clay is not mined at a low level where it was cauterized or molten.\n\n It was from an aqua bed, not a lava bed.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nNatural products that are transformed by man are highly toxic.\n\n My heat, electricity, electrical separation becomes toxic.\n\n The lead in the ground is not the same lead in the battery of a car.\n\n When you separate the aluminum in the ground in the manufacturing of aluminum, you heat it to 1900° - 2000°, you hit it with 18,000 to 20,000 volts.\n\n You separate out other metals.\n\n That's when it becomes toxic.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight.\n\n That's what I say.\n\n This is non cauterized, was not even affected by volcanic activity.\n\n There was a thermal bed and they don't mine it where it was 700°.\n\n\r\nThey mine it at an area where it didn't approach anywhere around 97°, 96° degree, and none of those minerals, except for phosphorus are affected at 98°.\n\n\r\nPhosphorus is altered, cauterized at 98 degrees, but that is the only mineral that's affected at that low of a temperature.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (95) Tick Bite \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nHow many people get bit every day\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThey call it Lyme disease?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nLyme disease is another farce.\n\n They go through six measurements to determine that maybe you have such thing called Lyme.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nThere was a yellow round thing around it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, it sounds like a localized detoxification.\n\n There's no such thing as Lyme and they're blaming again, poisons that are in the body that are discharging and causing fibromyalgia, lethargy, and chronic fatigue.\n\n \r\nThey wanna blame everything on something in nature.\n\n Like the bird flu, the Avion flu.\n\n Remember in the 70s, it was the swine flu.\n\n We're always blaming it on some animal, aids from the green monkey.\n\n You know, it is a joke.\n\n They're always blaming something in nature, but if you analyze the tissue and the excrement's, the discharge of any of those areas of the body that are going through detoxification.\n\n There is always some kind of heavy metal.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nEven from malaria.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt's a toxicity that's collected in the body, could be from many different sources?\n\n It's just collected in the blood.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (96) Trichinosis \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI have patients that get the intestinal worms of pigs and get trichinosis \r\nIf you read the Recipe Book and Joel Weinstock's work, the trichinosis parasite, the whipworm is what he's giving people, and it reverses inflammatory bowel syndrome\n\n  \r\nThese are people who can't even drink water without severe cramping and pain and as soon as they got the trichinosis worm in their intestines, within five to seven days they were completely asymptomatic.\n\n \r\nTrichinosis is something you want.\n\n I give it to my clients who have Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel syndrome.\n\n First thing I tell them is go get some pig intestines and get trichinosis.\n\n They go well like that.\n\n Just like that from eating it one time.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (97) Trichinosis In Mongoose \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nMongoose is an animal that can kill and eat a cobra they're so fast\n\n They're a little rodent, like a squirrel, and they're supposed to have had trichinosis, but I've examined the intestines of the mongoose and never seen a whipworm in them.\n\n  \r\nThe only whipworm I've ever seen were in humans and pigs.\n\n  \r\nI know this one fellow who claimed that he got a case of trichinosis from eating a raw mongoose.\n\n \r\nSo full of shit, I don't know where he's come from.\n\n There's no laboratory test on that mongooses' intestines, or anything to show that there's any kind of trichinosis.\n\n He got trichinosis from his own deteriorations of his intestines.\n\n He was an instincto eater.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (98) Vaccine Toxicity Passed On Generationally \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIt's common now because of vaccines\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, we've always had that.\n\n I've had vaccines, all of us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI know, but the second, third generation now on vaccines.\n\n So, the metal toxicity is accumulative, passes from the parent to the child and the child gets theirs, then they pass even more to their children and those children are getting more vaccines.\n\n \r\nDo you know that a child in California will receive 92 vaccines by the time they're 15.\n\n5 now.\n\n In Illinois, 128.\n\n The pharmaceutical industry knows that vaccines are a hoax.\n\n There is no evidence that they work, but there's billions of dollars in it and they don't give a shit about your health.\n\n \r\nThey're in the they're in the money-making industry, the sicker you are, the more money they make, whether it's vaccines or any kind of medication.\n\n You are their bread and butter and they don't give a shit about you dry and cotton clear.\n\n  \r\nThey're just like the army, they're out for they're out on their mission, and everybody who isn't in the military is an enemy.\n\n Everybody who's not in the military is an enemy.\n\n We're enemy to our own military government.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAnd that's why we call it fascism.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah, that's right.\n\n Doesn't matter.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (99) Vegans Cold, Bugs Get U If U Eat Fruit \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nAnd another thing when I was a fruitarian, if the temperature dropped below 50°, I was paralyzed in pain, so I was very sensitive\n\n  \r\nNow I can go out in the snow and roll in the snow, jump into a freezing lake.\n\n I can enjoy this reality a lot easier, ad also when I eat a lot of fruit, the bugs get me.\n\n \r\nIf I'm in Thailand, I'd stay away from fruit, unless it's unripe.\n\n Bugs don't touch you.\n\n I eat one slice of watermelon; I will have five insect bites that night.\n\n All these people eat a lot of fruit, they're easily consumed by insects.\n\n  \r\nThe insects like sweet blood because their larva grow fast.\n\n The mosquitoes don't eat for themselves, they don't eat our blood for themselves.\n\n They take it back to the larva and that's what the larva feed on, and they grow fast with a high sugar rate.\n\n Also makes some crazier insects, or bees eating all that sugar.\n\n \r\nThank God they put that insulin-like substance in it before they eat too much, but while they're traveling, they eat the nectar undigested sometimes.\n\n They'll swallow it and process so much of it so fast they can't build enough insulin quickly enough, so they can get very hyper and when they're fed syrup on their hive as well, then you've got some really crazy bees.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nThey put syrup.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n They wanna sell all the honey, so they feed 'em cheap syrup, which is a byproduct of manufacturing.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nBut I mean the ones that come in and containers in the market.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nYeah?\n\n Not, not the honey we eat.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (100) Vitiligo Is Heavy Metal Detox \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nCould those same things cause vitiligo on your face\n\n What would cause that?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, any kind of heavy metal coming out and detoxing through the skin would cause that?\n\n\r\nThere are two periods in humans where the body tries to throw heavy metals off in the biggest concentration.\n\n That's a puberty, that's why I have all the acne, and when a man hits around.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n men and women, mainly men, women have the discharge here, the changing hormones, so they still get to deliver theirs out through the uterus, and out the mucus there.\n\n\r\nBut men will go through a skin breakout between the age of 50, and 56 usually, and they'll have a heavy detox just as if they were a teenager.\n\n Sometimes it's on the back.\n\n There are other parts of the body, but sometimes it's on the face like a teenager.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (101) Vomited Fish \n \n \n \n \n### (102) Warts \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nWarts are dead cells that are being thrown off, mainly cartilage\n\n Well, not necessarily dead cells, but cells that are damaged, cartilage cells that are damaged.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nMostly people have them on the bottom of their feet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nComing out from the joints in their feet.\n\n That's why most people get warts on their hands and feet, cuz all the cartilage in every joint in the body, you bruise and damage that cartilage, and if your body can't dissolve those cells, that's what it makes, a wart.\n\n \r\nNo, moles are usually harder, like tendon tissue, sinew.\n\n  \r\nWell, I've got several remedies for that in the book.\n\n There are different things, you can put lemon, you can put pineapple, you can put potato skins, pineapple skin on there.\n\n  \r\nSomething I've been experimenting with with some people, I'm always experimenting when I can find some Guinea pigs, anybody wants to be Guinea pig, let me know.\n\n \r\nBut I always use natural substances.\n\n So, the thing I've been utilizing for the last year is putting whey, and it's very acidic and it will dry out warts a little quicker.\n\n \r\nWhen you are using citric acid, it can cause the other surrounding tissue to get very sore and painful, but when you use the whey, it will pinpoint it on there.\n\n It'll help dry it out and flake off quicker.\n\n  \r\nIt does leave more scar tissue, but that will go away eventually also.\n\n Also, what about someone's callus.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat about calluses?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nNo, you don't wanna put whey on a callus?\n\n Callus is a large scar tissue.\n\n A large area of scar tissue will harden and dry it and make it worse.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nSo, you can put coconut cream if you want to soften a callus.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nIt will help soften a callus?\n\n You have to apply it once every day.\n\n \r\nIf it's elevated, you want to deteriorate it.\n\n So, you can use some form of acid to help dissolve it, to lower it.\n\n Then at that point you don't want to use whey because it will harden it more acid.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nAcid lime lemon.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAcid like lemon, like pineapple and like whey, those are highly acidic foods?\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (103) Water Brands \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nI drink Gerolsteiner, San Pellegrino, San Benedetto\n\n Any of the waters that I can get that are naturally carbonated or Mountain Valley, which comes right out of the ground, which in glass.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about Perrier.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nPerrier's good, you notice it on their label, it says natural carbonation added?\n\n They went back to it.\n\n \r\nNatural carbonation means that the carbon's coming out of the well, it's got a gas in the water and they fuse them in together.\n\n \r\nThat's natural carbonation.\n\n  \r\nThey just say sparkling mineral water.\n\n Like Calistoga, Coca-Cola.\n\n Chemical fizz and chemical product.\n\n \r\nA lot of the chemicals in Coca-Cola are made from petroleum.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about water purifiers.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nThat takes out some substances?\n\n Holds it into that magnetic property, but then again.\n\n Let's say it binds with all the magnetic minerals.\n\n Fluoride bypasses it, aluminum bypasses it.\n\n They're not magnetic.\n\n  \r\nSo, your waters even more toxic because you have no minerals to help bind with.\n\n So, treated water's not a good substance.\n\n I don't care if they say, \"Oh, well.\n\n It just takes out some bad toxins out of the water.\n\n\" I'm still not going to drink it because they've reduced the toxins, but some of those toxins are even more radical and cause more damage.\n\n They will.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (104) Weston Price, Grains \n \n**[2006],[attendee]**\n\r\n\n\r\nYou know Dr\n\n Weston price.\n\n  I read his book, he actually was curing people with sprouting grains?\n\n Do you ever suggest using healthy grains.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPrice was not an experimenter or he was an extrapolator and an exaggerator?\n\n He was not a scientist and he did not experiment.\n\n Pottenger was an experimenter, Howell experimenter.\n\n Price was a theorist, a researcher and theorist.\n\n He didn't do any controlled experiment.\n\n He had a belief because a lot of people told him sprouting will heal.\n\n It has not proved to do so.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (105) What Aajonus Eats In Asia \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nIf you're out of town, and you don't have your food\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWhat do I eat.\n\n I eat lots of eggs, avocado and coconut, and let me tell you, I find the fattiest meat I can?\n\n  \r\nLike when I'm in Thailand, I go and they'll have fat just hanging.\n\n \r\nThey don't sell anything like that here.\n\n It's hanging, dripping, big chunks of fat with flies all over it, that's what I get.\n\n I'll eat probably a pound of that a day, at least a pound of that a day or else I'll lose tremendous amounts of weight.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nWhat about in a modern city.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nWell, I go for coconut, avocados, but I always take enough butter with me?\n\n I rarely run out.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nHow do you bring it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI just put it in a cooler?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nOh, you ship it to yourself.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI can do that, but most of the time I've been carrying it with me?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n \r\nWhat about the x ray.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nAs long as it goes to that small x-ray one time, you're okay?\n\n More than that, not good.\n\n \r\nSo, I take enough to take me.\n\n \r\nI know I put in the book that I was backpacking in Hawaii for 9 days with my butter honey mixed, and it kept without fermentation, without spoiling.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (106) Whey Gets Rid Of Stiffness, Acidic \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nLet's say stiffness and you drink a half a cup to a whole cup of whey a day to get rid of those mineral deposits that cause stiffness, and achiness in joints\n\n Even arthritis and rheumatism, where they have mineral deposits.\n\n  \r\nThe mineral deposits that will collect in joints from bruised tissue.\n\n That's what arthritis and rheumatism is.\n\n It's usually toxins that are leaving the bone marrow and passing through the joints cause that's the only exit point from the bone marrow out the joints.\n\n  \r\n99% of all arthritis and rheumatism is caused from heavy metals poisons leaving the bone marrow, going out through the joints, damaging the cartilage on the way out.\n\n  \r\nMineral deposits try to bind with it and lock with it, and it causes all kinds of crystals and then scraping and cutting of the cartilage, which causes what.\n\n Bacteria, and then they blame the whole problem on the bacteria?\n\n Viral or bacterial arthritis or rheumatism.\n\n  \r\nThe bacteria's going in there to dissolve the problem, not cause the problem.\n\n The problem is always medication and industrial pollution caused from metallic poisoning in the first place.\n\n So, if you're having that whey to help reduce those symptoms, you will notice that you have to urinate and evacuate the bladder sooner because it's highly acidic, so just be conscious of that.\n\n  \r\nIt's not something you want to continue with without some kind of break.\n\n It dries out the system, unless you're gonna take it with a little coconut cream or coconut oil.\n\n Coconut cream's always better because you have the water-soluble fats.\n\n Is that a misnomer.\n\n It is not a misnomer?\n\n You have water soluble fats in the coconut cream that is not in the coconut oil.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (107) Whole Foods \n \n**[2006],[Attendee]**\n \r\n\n \r\nCan we get pork from whole foods\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI don't touch much from whole foods?\n\n I go to wild oats and some of the others, but whole foods is a liar.\n\n  \r\nWhole foods all-natural beef is fed 15% bakery waste.\n\n I said, wait a minute.\n\n No freaking cow eats donuts, but they eat degraded grains the donuts are made of.\n\n I said, but they don't boil them in oil and eat donuts.\n\n They're still eating their all-natural food.\n\n That's their logic.\n\n They have no logic.\n\n They're out there to make money, and that's it.\n\n  \r\nAnd that company is, I don't know if you know the Bass family from Texas, they're like the Bushes from Texas.\n\n They are all about money and that is it.\n\n  \r\nWell, get it in writing from the home office and you won't get it.\n\n They'll lie to their employees, but you ask them to put it in writing and you won't see it.\n\n They won't do it.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n \r\nThere grass-fed beef isn't really grass fed.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nI haven't investigated their new grass-fed beef?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nIt's still probably a, a slight step above a conventional injected beef.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n \r\nOh, yes?\n\n Definitely.\n\n That doesn't mean it's completely clean or all natural.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (108) Women Live Longer From Period \n \n \n \n \n### (109) Zoelite \n \n**[2006],[Aajonus]**\n \r\n\n \r\nTake each person that they give it to, they will measure the amount of zeolite that they put into the body, and how much is secreted and excreted in a 24-hour period\n\n And if they get rid of 90% of it, I'll say that the rest goes out in perspiration, then I'll buy it and I'll go with it, but when only 24 to 30% is removed in a 48-hour period, it is staying in the body.\n\n \r\nSo, remixing and unearthing, mining that stuff out of your tissues and getting it recycling, it's gonna cause more damage, unless you get it out of the system.\n\n The point is to get it out of the system.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n"

2 and a half years and then go off the diet for 6 months and hes back into the crack.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n He craves it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Yeah, physiological craving  It's like the pharmaceutical \r\nindustry knew about?\n\n And when when bush senior in the CIA were hauling in crack cocaine during the eighties they were affiliated with pharmaceutical houses that knew hat Ritalin and crack addiction were connected.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n Yeah well we're talking about major crime bosses, that doesn't surprise us.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Yes, that's what the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n All major crime is.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (3) Alkaline Food & HCL Release When Food Is Eaten \n \n**[Jim]**\n Are we going around I'm ready\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Let's do it Jim?\n\n**[Jim]**\n I have a real fundamental lack of understanding, if a stomach acid to digest like meat and stuff like that when you when you take something alkaline like the vegetable juice or anything alkaline, pineapple whatever doesn't that\r\n immediately meet up with the hydrochloric acid and.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus ],[Jim]**\nNeutralizes it \r\n\r\n\n So what is the benefit to the rest of the body.\n\n In other words.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n We just have to understand the body of stomach does not secrete hydrochloric acid until something goes into it.\n\n Your stomachs not stupid.\n\n When you put the vegetable juice in it vegetable juice doesn't call hydrochloric acid secretion.\n\n Meat, dairy eggs the \r\nanimal matter goes into your stomach that will cause hydrochloric acid secretion.\n\n Avocados will too.\n\n Anything that's high in fat, coconuts will too.\n\n**[Jim],[Aajonus],[Jim]**\n Okay, so when you ingest something like vegetable juice which is that is you know on the alkaline side then it can actually get integrated farther in, like it'll end up making salts somewhere\r\n\r\n\n Yes \r\n\r\n\n But it'll go through a lot of digestion for, y'know.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Well, there's very little digestion, when it's absorbed it goes to the pancreas mainly and the pancreas disassembles the vitamins and the enzymes and reassembles them into whatever we need for our digestion.\n\n**[Jim]**\n So and so that is where the value is.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n And what it can and when those products get into the blood, they\r\n alkalize the blood.\n\n Thank you all now it's clear easy.\n\n Okay I'm going to go to a question.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (4) Alkalizing The Blood Timing \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n It gets into the blood it alkalanizes the blood thats what you wanna do alkaline blood, not the digestive tract that's why you don't eat whole vegetables on this diet so you don't have all the vegetable matter going through the intestine secreting alkaline fluids and interfering with bacteria\n\n\r\nSo you if you drink the juice its pretty much all absorbed by the time he reaches the bottom of the duodenum.\n\n So it only Alkalanizes the blood and temporarily the stomach.\n\n Not about 20 minutes, well about half an hour later your stomach will be starting to re acidity itself.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n That's why we wait an hour.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n You wait an hour?\n\n First thing in the morning it only takes about 20 minutes to absorb the the juice, then 20 minutes to reacidify so in 45 minutes you can eat.\n\n But after that it usually takes a half an hour for each phase.\n\n \r\nHalf an hour in order to absorb all the juice and half an hour to re acidify the stomach.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (5) Are Microbes Ever A Problem \n \n**[Attendee]**\n Are there any situations where there's any microbes that are ever problem to us\n\n The microbes are a part of nature?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Well let's say?\n\n Let's say you're so much in deteriation and you're so toxic.\n\n That if you you know lay down in a pile of ants.\n\n May not live.\n\n If you fell asleep and you're really stinky a vulture might come down and start eating at you.\n\n Then you've got a problem.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n It always chemical.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n You could ultimately be decomposing if your bodys so toxic?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Absolutely!.\n \n \n \n### (6) Athletes Foot \n \n**[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n Okay do you have a question\r\n\r\n\n  Yes well a- chronic athletes foot or fungus right, over a lifetime right\n\n How- would you address that.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Well, umm?\n\n.\n\n there's no way you can stop it.\n\n Because that mold eat.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n The body flows this way a lot of the heavy metals go to the bottom of the body in the feet.\n\n Since everything \r\nis constricted and we wear shoes.\n\n And we keep air off of it, it has a tendency to cause the tissue in the foot uhh to-to detoxify via molds.\n\n So the only way to umm.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n  to address that is to get more air to make sure you wear sandals something like that just to get more air you also use primal facial\r\n body care cream directly on the feet and that'll stop the itching, won't stop the mold it'll stop the damage done as the decomposing bi products from the mold are passed through the skin that causes the dryness and flaking of the skin tissue.\n\n So it will mitigate the symptoms the agony of the itching \r\nand the burning of the soreness, uh but it won't stop the molds, we just can't stop it let me take something like an antibiotic.\n\n And then you're basically making your feet move toward a serious disease.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n Okay, thank you.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n The disease that could be created by stopping the mold from growing in the feet are osteoporosis because if they get into the bones and grow where they norm- they usually are in the skin and they go to the uh.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n joints! In the cartilage, if they pass into the bone it'll cause osteoporosis \r\nit also causes rheumatoid arthritis, overgrowth of tissues, spurs.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n Okay \r\n\r\n\n So it's good to have the molds, those needed to relieve the symptoms and stop eating things that cause.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n Yeah \r\n\r\n\n All the kind of deterioration in the body.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n Sorry, you're saying the molds or antiobiotics will cause rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Both will cause it?\n\n The mold won't cause it, the mold prevents it.\n\n Trying to prevent it.\n\n But if somebody keeps eating a bad diet you know the worst diet there is then ofcourse it will just get worse.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n Mine went away when I stopped using soap.\n\n Right after like within a week.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n What.\n\n**[Attendee],[Aajonus]**\n Soap\r\n\r\n\n Some people just from eating- they're allergic to soaps so when they put soap on their skin, it damages the skin and molds are there to break down those cells?\n\n So you just have to stop using soap.\n\n Stop \r\nbreaking down the skin, the under.\n\n The second and third layer of skin deep because the soaps get in their and damages it and a mold has to break it down.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (7) Beet Juice For Kidney & Digestive Problems \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n That it does help the liver, it helps the kidneys it helps anything that- whatever we need\n\n.\n\n solvents made.\n\n Beet juice helps because beet juice has has a natural hiydrochloric acid.\n\n Umm.\n\n.\n\n Materialization complex within it.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n How often would you recommend having beet juice, is a couple of ounces enough.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n I don't think that anybody needs it unless they have a kidney problem or a digestive problem?\n\n But if you're gonna have it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n you know just to make sure, then maybe once a month.\n\n 4 ounces a month, 2 ounces at a time.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n I put some gerolsteiner in mine, I don't drink it straight.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (8) Brain Has The Most Toxicity In The Body \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n You have a lot of toxins stored in the neck, everybody does, heavy metals\n\n.\n\n.\n\n The brain has the most toxins, the lethal toxin than anything in the body, any part of the body.\n\n The brain works off of metallic minerals.\n\n Metals as well so there are heavy metals when you're eating cooked foods \r\nuhh.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n when you're breathing in pollution  most of that is concentrated in the brain and the lymph glands in your neck and throat.\n\n Your sinuses are where the brain detoxifies.\n\n So if it has to transfer down through the brain stem, down these lymph glands and you're gonna have a lot of pain in the neck.\n\n\r\nSo it doesn't necessarily have to be directly in the neck, but it will pass through the neck can cause the same kind of pain as if it were in the neck.\n\n Sometimes if its in the neck you also get an inflamed skin, maybe some rash as it detoxifies.\n\n Usually will follow the pain if it's in the \r\nbrain stem, the glands will swell in the throat and  you'll start as discharging mucus in the throat and sometimes in the sinus.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n We're getting into anatomy this time hahaha.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (9) Brain Hemorrage Use Green Cabbage Juice \n \n**[Kathy]**\n Yeah like if someone has like, you know a brain hemorrhage its the same thing goes for them too\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Green cabbage juice.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n Green cabbage juice! That would automatically also stop the bleeding of the brain.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Yes?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n Anything else.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n It would even happen quicker?\n\n Quicker in the brain than it would in other tissues.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n They probably- when in the hospital they probably open your brain up.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n They usually put a chemical, to thicken the blood?\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (10) Building Bacteria In Intestines \n \n**[Aajonus],[Jim]**\n I'll start with Jim over here okay, question!\r\n\r\n\n Regarding building bacteria in the intestine\n\n What is friendly for them and what cuts it out.\n\n I've taken high meat trying to establish bacteria?\n\n What is bad for it and what things are good for it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Well, uhh?\n\n.\n\n if you- if you wash the high down with milk, the lactic acid will destroy a lot of the bacteria.\n\n So that won't work also honey eaten with high meat will destroy it.\n\n So you need to wait about 15 minutes after you eat the high meat before you have anything else.\n\n \r\nExcept for water.\n\n Water doesn't seem to destroy the bacteria.\n\n**[Jim]**\n Okay.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n You can rinse your mouth out with lemon or lime juice you want to get rid of the taste and the odor.\n\n**[Jim]**\n Any other foods.\n\n Good for it or not good for it?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Uhh?\n\n.\n\n well fecal matters always great, you know because fecal matter has the ecoli directly to get the balance going properly.\n\n If it's a small intestines, the high meats me a little bit better, if it's your bowels that's a problem then eating the ecoli, the fecal matter is better.\n\n**[Jim],[Aajonus],[Attendee]**\n All right :/\r\n\r\n\n Okay\r\n\r\n\n  What is the maximum amount if you want a combination of fecal matter and high meat for someone on the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n If you want to build ecoli to make sure it gets all the way down to the bowels to make sure as much as possible gets down, it's good to eat a little high meat first?\n\n And then eat some fecal matter after that and what you could- I suggest- I've seen people eat a tremendous amount \r\nlike 4 ounces of I need with 2 ounces of fecal matter with the bowel, bowel tissue.\n\n And it's never caused a problem and when people have done that, they've only had to do it one time to completely relieve chronic constipation that has beem carried on all their lives.\n\n\r\nAnd it's worked for up to 8 months at a time.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (11) Cabbage Juice Blood Clot & Vegetarian Stopped The Diet and Died \n \n**[Aajonus]**\n The minerals in the other juices have a tendency to bind with the vitamin K and vitamin U which help blood clot\n\n It work so well let me give you an example there's a Swedish, sorry Swiss movie star, uh who had been a longtime vegetarian like 24 to 26 years.\n\n She got urine cancer.\n\n And\r\nthey could- it started bleeding and all the doctors- I mean this is a wealthy movie star.\n\n Nobody could stop the bleeding, so they sent her to America to UCLA and USC medical centers to talk with their specialists to get the- you know- to stop the bleeding.\n\n Because she was having to get up to 2 \r\ntransfusions a week, occasionally 3 transfusions a week, that's a lot of blood loss.\n\n Uh so, she was an in Erewhon health food store one day and she saw one of my clients getting all this dairy and butter and everything and he looks so healthy she asked what he was doing.\n\n So he told her about the diet\r\nand to give me a call.\n\n She called me ands he just said you know I heard about your diet and I wonder if you can help me but I'm going to stay vegetarian.\n\n I said well, then I can't help you.\n\n And she said well this is my problem I not only have cancer, I'm bleeding.\n\n And I'm having to get quite a few transfusions\r\na week.\n\n They colorized it.\n\n Grafted skin, they've done everything.\n\n And it won't stay sealed, keeps bleeding.\n\n I said well that's pretty easy all you have to do is drink a cup of cabbage juice, 8 ounces of cabbages morning and night and probably within 24 hours it will stop.\n\n\r\nShe said you are one crazy man! Pop! Hung up the phone.\n\n I got a call the next morning she obviously went right out, got the cabbage juice.\n\n The next morning  she called me about 1:00 in the afternoon she called me at 8:00 clock in the morning to tell me the bleeding stopped the first time in a year and a half.\n\n\r\nSo course you know she got on the diet and did everything, ate the raw meat.\n\n Everything was going wonderfully, then she got an attack of- really the story should end there because  I'm telling you how it works, but she got into feeling guilty about eating meat again, so she stopped eating meat and \r\nwithin 4 months she was dead from cancer and bleeding.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n She stopped going the diet.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n What show?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n I don't know?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n In your experience, is there people that are too far gone to be helped by following the diet.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n There are lots of people that I thought were too far gone and they reversed?\n\n There were a few people, probably 3 people, that I was sure would never die but did.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n That you were sure would never die.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n Yes, would not diet, but that was only 3 people?\n\n And I've seen probably 40 people that I thought would never make it, but they did.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n Did they follow it.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n No they followed it, but you know I didn't think they were that far gone, but they died anyway?\n\n**[Kathy]**\n Is it because they didn't take high meat or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n I don't know what it was, maybe they're just willed to die?\n\n They're time to go.\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (12) Cabbage Juice To Help The Blood Clot \n \nAlso, to help you know the blood clotting a little bit so you don't rupture so many blood cells, you can drink a half a cup of green vegetable juice about every two days\n\n.\n \n \n \n### (13) Carpal Tunnel Emf From Computes \n \n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWell, it depends on the individual\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nMost of them that suffers will suffer like.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWho's that carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSore joints \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a ******** answer through all that soreness?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThere were secretaries have been around hitting hard key punch.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYou know typewriters for years and writers never getting carpal tunnel syndrome and let me tell you those old typewriters I used to write with one and it was a lot of work.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIt's the electric, magnetic, magnetic fields in your computer.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYour laptops and your electric typewriters.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThat's the problem?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIt's not the way you're holding your hand.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nTo cop out.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThey don't want you to know the true reason 'cause they're so ******* cheap that they'll use instead of using transistors, they'll use capacitors, or it's the other way around.\n\n It will cost them $0.\n\n50 more.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThen they'll eliminate the electromagnetic fields and cause a problem because they're cheaper.\n\n Want to save.\n\n You know $0?\n\n50.\n\n They'll you'll **** your health up?\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nWell, can't they.\n\n

Attendee \r\n\r\nMake it the way that that's better?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWell, yeah, but that's very expensive.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nYou can do.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThat, or you do what I do, use a laptop.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYou put the laptop somebody you know further away from you and use a separate keyboard.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nSilver D.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThen you don't worry.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAbout it \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nYou don't need it.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nHow many feet away do you have to

\r\n\r\nGive question\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nI do, I have had for the past couple of.\n\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis week's \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nA chronic Nosebleed.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee

unbearable, my nose is well.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nOn this issue.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nSo what is that.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThat's an indication that you're discarding some pretty toxic substances from the brain or the?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe eye area.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nOut through the science and you're not forming enough mucus to protect the mucous lining.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo eating things like cream.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAnd milk and eggs together will help.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nForm a lot.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nOf mucus \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nEggs and cream are very good for that, you know, like ice cream.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAlso, they help you know the blood clotting a little bit so you don't rupture so many blood cells.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYou can drink a half a cup of green vegetable juice about every two days.\n\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you, have vegetable juice everyday.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nI mean cabbages green cabbage.\n\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHave it.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nGreen cabbage \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nRed cabbage will cause

\r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nNo, you don't want to do that.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIt's a alkaline substance.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAnd it causes the mucus thing.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYou don't want to send the mucus.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIt's already a problem if you're having bloody.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nMucus mucus is too thin.\n\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut when you take it internally.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (15) Dark Circle From Exercise Liver Problems = Butter&honey \n \n Attendee \r\n\r\nWhenever I exercise, I get a very deep dark\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee

\r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWhat that is.\n\n \r\n\r\n Speaker 2 \r\n\r\nWell, from my experience, dark circles mean a liver problem?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\n Speaker 2 \r\n\r\nThe hot water bottle and your liver at night.\n\n \r\n\r\n Speaker 2 \r\n\r\nMake sure the circulation increases.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (16) Detox Points On Pain(pain) \n \nAttendee \r\n\r\nYeah, recently I've started having like more painful detox is we're just typing a meeting with Kathy and she's saying you said something about like when you get the pane on this side, it's really coming from over here\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nSo this is kind of interesting.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nJust finding out.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nLike the mechanics of what goes on in your detox and what causes the different symptoms and stuff.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWell, the transfers from one side to the other usually only happens.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIn the spinal cord.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAnd and directly at the spinal.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nBut otherwise, that usually doesn't happen.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSometimes in appendicitis you'll have the pain over here in the appendix is.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nReally over.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nHere those are about the only two circumstances where the pain is transferred to one side together.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe brain can also do that with this part of.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nThe nervous so if I if.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nI gotta make a very sharp pain in the shoulders.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIs that something is detoxing from the shoulder absolutely and you have to understand we get our injections.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nYeah, in these in their arms up here and most of the toxicity goes into.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAnd usually during late fall and the winter is the time for those joints to detoxify.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nUsually by the time may comes around, it'll stop.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nThey just had like.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nThe mechanism who I was flat on my back for two days, so is that like it's turning back to.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWell, you have a lot of toxins stored in the neck, everybody.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThose heavy metals everything.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nHold on.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (17) Deviated Steptum Surgery Bump On Nose \n \n Aajonus \r\n\r\nOK, do you have a question\n\n

what's in the liver, which caused the damage.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIf it was cytomegalovirus, it's no longer active.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nA virus is never the problem.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe virus is a solvent.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe body makes virus viruses.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAre not alive.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThey're just a soap.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo that goes in dissolved toxicity.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo if you had a virus, all of your hepatitis virus, all of them are made within the liver or some other part of the body to dissolve dead cells in the liver to get rid of the liver damaged liver tissue.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo you can rebuild the.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nLimit and help it so.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAny hepatitis is and retroviruses.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nMega viruses are your last ditch effort to save a very toxic liver.\n\n \r\n\r\n Attendee \r\n\r\nSo wouldn't happen a little more toxic, correct.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nWell, like I said in the book, when I had the poison mushroom story delivered, but?\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nCream is is a little too hard on the.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe liver, because it has to take the cream and make it into butter.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nIt has separated as use lots of enzymes to separate the way and make it into butter.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo it's already a better form.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nThe liver doesn't have to work this way.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nAnd you have to push it like I forced myself to eat at least a pound and a half of butter a day after the poison.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nMushroom 'cause I knew the liver would not work unless.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nI forced it to work.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (19) Does Aajonus Eat Raw Pork \n \n Attendee \r\n\r\nRight\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nI europoort not very often?\n\n

'cause the page really mainly cooked food that was being put out the windows.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nSo they were getting diseased, so it's been illegal.\n\n \r\n\r\n Aajonus \r\n\r\nTo eat

Feeding Grains Which Have No Fat To Bind Toxins \n \nGood question\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, I am interested.\n\n \r\n\r\nNow, in the mad cow disease thing, it's.\n\n \r\n\r\nVirus, I would like to understand it more.\n\n \r\n\r\nI understand the causes like pesticides.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that kind of thing, right.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's just that?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know when I'm back home in.\n\n \r\n\r\nCanada, if there's just so much.\n\n \r\n\r\nHoo ha about it and.\n\n \r\n\r\nI don't understand it fully through like come out and saying go, you know I tell them hey it's all.\n\n \r\n\r\nBogus we're hearing on the TV.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut I I'm just not.\n\n \r\n\r\nSure how to.\n\n \r\n\r\nReally explain it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo they get it.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, there's a serious problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou've got animals that are getting degenerative degeneration degenerative.\n\n \r\n\r\nActivity in their spinal cord and brain.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's turning into.\n\n \r\n\r\nSponge melting air pockets eat away because they're not eating the foods that they need, and they constantly get these.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey they put these new warmers on their spinal cords.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, the new one was on the spinal cord.\n\n \r\n\r\nPlus they're getting all these hormones and antibiotics and other.\n\n \r\n\r\nHeavily alkaloid laden.\n\n \r\n\r\nChemicals in their diet that affect the nervous system.\n\n \r\n\r\nAll those heavy metals, all those after Lloyds go to the nervous system.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey do damage.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo if you put a cow on a.\n\n \r\n\r\nHeavy fat diet.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know, if you fed him lots of grasses that were very high in fat or other vegetables that were very high in fat and throw avocados down for them, they wouldn't react as badly because they would have the facts to bind with those poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut when there's there there fell these grains.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhich are pretty fabulous.\n\n \r\n\r\nYour body does create fat from it.\n\n \r\n\r\nTrying to bind with it, but it's not.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe same kind of fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nHandles it easily, so we have general degeneration so that kind of the duration just means you don't want to eat the spinal quarter of the.\n\n \r\n\r\nBrain now when I was in Paris from 1993 to 1996, three months out of the year, I was eating the mad cow disease and I had no effects.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat is the actual disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's a?\n\n \r\n\r\nVirus a solvent that's being created in body.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's yeah, it's basic.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell what happens is the spy created the nervous system, creates a solvent that causes a folded prion, and affirmed pretty on as a.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe pretty honest you got fat and got protein bodies which are called prion.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou got a toxin that goes in as pronouns were there to help structure and also could be helpful too.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs solvents, then when you have these poisons go into then they fall, so they don't react properly, so there's no defense mechanism.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut you have to understand the medical profession does not in the farm and the industries do not want to be blamed for their chemical problems and all of our problems or chemical problems.\n\n \r\n\r\nEven the tribes we cooked meat mainly with system cooked meat.\n\n \r\n\r\nHave no serious degenerative diseases.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd old age will get also your chlorosis.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey'll get really they.\n\n \r\n\r\nWon't have the same muscle tissue.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey have slow atrophy, but no serious heart disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo serious Alzheimer's, nothing like that.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat only happens, you know, high polluted societies and chemicals.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo the Pharmaceutical industry and over industry and the government and the planetary.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe governments are all bodies of the industry.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf industries of all sorts, they are protecting themselves.\n\n \r\n\r\nThis whole hyperblue about so much mercury toxicity in fish is our problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat they are doing is throwing the blame off for mercury from fish.\n\n \r\n\r\nWe want to distract you.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe greatest mercury poisoning which would take you four years of eating fish to contaminate yourself.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat they do with one vaccine with Thimerosal.\n\n \r\n\r\nOne vaccine will give you.\n\n \r\n\r\n40 years of the contamination.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf eating fish, cooked fish any right soon.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know what that's.\n\n \r\n\r\nAny vaccine, this timer is all in and that's 80% of all the vaccines?\n\n \r\n\r\nMore kids are getting autism.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou got it.\n\n \r\n\r\n6800 seventy 800% more.\n\n \r\n\r\n1997 nineteen 97 they found that most kids have been getting autism.\n\n \r\n\r\nSince 1997 is in a.\n\n \r\n\r\nPaper a lot more than that.\n\n \r\n\r\nI mean most.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey've been studying this 30 years.\n\n \r\n\r\nAren't they getting away from designers.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey're lying, they're lying?\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, first of all, the government the FDA gave them five years to phase out because they have billions of dollars or vaccine stored in their vaults.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it's OK to go ahead and poison the children for five.\n\n \r\n\r\nYears because the problem Supercross.\n\n \r\n\r\nWill lose money.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo that's basically over that when the new drugs that they're saying are very low in thimerosol by Marisol, something called dimers, also called for Marisol, which is everything predicted.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe correct pronunciation.\n\n \r\n\r\nLet's see.\n\n \r\n\r\nSteve Bannon \r\n\r\nAnyway, it's still in there.\n\n \r\n\r\nWe have another company and I had that.\n\n \r\n\r\nSome of the vaccines tested and they were very little reduction.\n\n \r\n\r\nSee, the problem is that they put the fire.\n\n \r\n\r\nMarisol in the vaccines because vaccines were, you know, like which happened to to pass through.\n\n \r\n\r\nEvery time he vaccinated an animal they went into.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnaphylaxis, shock and died.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that same thing will happen to humans, but for some reason when they use the thimerosal in it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt causes such a reaction in the body that the body won't die.\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't go into that kind of.\n\n \r\n\r\nShock as often.\n\n \r\n\r\nSuch as what reactions.\n\n \r\n\r\nOn the type of anaphylaxis the?\n\n \r\n\r\nAllergy to the to the.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe to the disease that they're giving you when they inject you with the disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nSection 8.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's such that it's not.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen legal.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight it it stops the the high rate of fatalities.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe court martialing \r\n\r\nThat they don't do to armed forces, right.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey stop that, but they?\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't take the vaccine.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n \r\n\r\nSecond, yeah, you're still forcing them to.\n\n \r\n\r\nI said that.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that's ******** \r\n\r\nIf you if you go to those.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you hear the inductees and the volunteers who went to the military, they still threaten.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey don't.\n\n \r\n\r\nClaire Marshall you, but they sure make your life hell.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt sounds like what you're saying is when they put the heavy metal in the vaccination, that it's almost like.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt kind of inhibits the actual disease enough so that it.\n\n \r\n\r\nDoesn't make that huge reaction.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I think what happens is when you get a flush of.\n\n \r\n\r\nDisease in the blood.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut the body reacts traumatically because normally a disease will be a developmental reaction within the system and the body has a reaction to that every time, every single vaccine for something like 9 years.\n\n \r\n\r\nEvery animal that Pasteur injected with the disease died.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot one survived.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen they started using formaldehyde with with the disease and that and then they started using thimerosol in the 1920s.\n\n \r\n\r\nLiquid murder, what happened was it looks like the body had to deal with the poison instead of the disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo the bodies it was so yes, they're so involved with dealing with the high poison that the disease didn't get registered, and then the body didn't go into an anaphylactic shock as often.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it's true.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut there are people who go in there in a flex it shot and died from vaccines even with the primary result.\n\n \r\n\r\nHave a push.\n\n \r\n\r\nOn this mad cow disease because.\n\n \r\n\r\nI know that it's like most viruses and backwards.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat are out there.\n\n \r\n\r\nOn for billions of years.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs long as planets been here, but since that's a more recent thing, it's essentially been created by man, correct.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecause OK?\n\n \r\n\r\nI wanted to.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut it has the exact same symptoms of foot and mouth, which is basically a flu a cow flu.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, so when like you hear that Europe when.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey you know.\n\n \r\n\r\nBurned all the millions of cows.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat they had.\n\n \r\n\r\nOver there and they.\n\n \r\n\r\nApparently couldn't bury them in the soil.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey've actually stored them in old like World War.\n\n \r\n\r\nTwo plane hangars.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd just look 'cause you can't.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's so toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can't.\n\n \r\n\r\nEven touch any.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf it, and apparently if they do like a, what do you call it like.\n\n \r\n\r\nAn autopsy on someone who's had drink and mad cow?\n\n \r\n\r\nThey have to literally throw away everything 'cause there's no way to sterilize it to sterilize anything?\n\n \r\n\r\nIs that true.\n\n \r\n\r\nI mean, do you?\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, just remember when something has arrived, sterilization doesn't matter?\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, I mean that matters.\n\n \r\n\r\nSterilizing is there to destroy bacteria and virus and things.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat are alive.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut when you have metal contamination and poison, you can sterilize all you want to.\n\n You can sterilize strychnine's or you're blue in the face.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can heat it up to 20 thirty 200 degrees and it won't disturb it.\n\n You'll still die.\n\n It poisoning that strychnine poisoning.\n\n They're just throwing it off on something unnatural disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen it's really the chemical poisoning of those animals, which is the problem, and there's so many poisons, there's so many alkaloids, and just strychnine is an alcoholic.\n\n \r\n\r\nAll of those poisons are heavy alkaloids, just different chemical structures of alkaloids.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat makes them those poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo when you have all of this in those animals.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can't bury it 'cause it'll damage the soil.\n\n \r\n\r\nGet into get.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe groundwater, right.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs the groundwater will get into the system?\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I guess.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo my question is, you do believe that.\n\n \r\n\r\nThis particular virus is extremely?\n\n \r\n\r\nToxic and that it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs but it's.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe virus is not toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe virus it's just.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut the.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe poisoning of the body is toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat what I'm saying is like the ashes that are.\n\n \r\n\r\nLeftover from the cows I.\n\n \r\n\r\nMean you agree that they should be just.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it's not the virus that's the problem, it's the poison that that's the problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, but you still say that they should just.\n\n .\n \n \n \n###

\r\n\r\nYou'll store a lot of garbage in the connective tissue and in the limb.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then everything could not be fed properly and it usually takes about six years, 6 1/2 years on the diet

cases were military personnel are court martialed are kicked out of the military for refusing vaccinations.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey they give you the whole story on autism and that, and it's a it's a real

off these vaccinations, scares and the government?\n\n Our money is funding these huge stockpiles of these vaccinations.\n\n Yeah, NVC ww.\n\nnvc.\n\norg.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat's the website.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can contact me if you need to get that?\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd NV National Vaccine Information Center.\n\n \r\n\r\nGot it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo every disease that we hear about them.\n\n \r\n\r\nIsn't

(38) Need To Be Fat To Get Healthy \n \nBut if you want to get healthy, you\n\n \r\n\r\nHave to have tremendous amounts.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf fat on the body.\n\n \r\n\r\n'cause the fats bind with the poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nOtherwise the poisons get into the cells and damage the RNA and DNA.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd the cell itself and can kill them.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd often do.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd the fat if you have them, it will absorb it.\n\n Give an example.\n\n In September.\n\n I was in Asheville, NC and there's a whole group there who have been long time vegetarians in a community called Earth Haven.\n\n \r\n\r\n99% long time vegetarians all very ill.\n\n \r\n\r\nOne of them got on my diet, made such a radical change.\n\n \r\n\r\nEverybody started following suit.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo now there are no vegetarians in that community and they've all changed or even raising, you know pigs and everything now.\n\n \r\n\r\nSearch Facebook.\n\n \r\n\r\nGoats you know and cows for their milk and everything.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut when I was there.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, they were the time the vegetarians were more unhealthy than most of my regular, you know, American type sad diet people, standard American diet people.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut one of these fellows came in and I could see never even been into health consciousness at all.\n\n \r\n\r\nHe had very thick skin, looked like he had been a drug addict and an alcoholic for 30 years.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd you know I photographed his irises and blue irises up on the.\n\n \r\n\r\nScreen and they.\n\n \r\n\r\nWere clean.\n\n \r\n\r\nLike he was a young man in his 20s.\n\n He's about 5253 years old.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd I said here's probably maybe.\n\n \r\n\r\n£20 overweight \r\n\r\nSo there was something very wrong with that picture.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I said it doesn't make sense.\n\n I can tell that you've been, you know, been a drug user for at least 2530 years.\n\n I'll call it for at least 30 years.\n\n He said yes.\n\n \r\n\r\nI said, but it doesn't make sense because you don't have all this internal damage that most people have.\n\n It's your weight.\n\n You said well when I went on your diet five months ago I was £300.\n\n \r\n\r\nHe had been.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat fat most of his life.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd all that fat protected.\n\n \r\n\r\nHis glands and his organs and everything from severe damage.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo fat is a wonderful thing.\n\n \r\n\r\nStream fat is even a wonder.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, that gets a little much there.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know you have to have a.\n\n \r\n\r\nCrane taking place.\n\n \r\n\r\nLittle difficult.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I just.\n\n \r\n\r\nWanted to.\n\n \r\n\r\nUnderstand, I think in the past I thought.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou had said.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you mix your green juice with.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe meat it creates.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo, you won't digest either.\n\n \r\n\r\nOh, OK.\n\n \r\n\r\nFor the vegetable juice is alkaline.\n\n \r\n\r\nYour fruit is acid.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou need an acid environment

not\n\n \r\n\r\nIf they don't need it, for example, perform we will, uh, hookworm, grow and given that.\n\n \r\n\r\nAccording to your theories don't need to detox or not, it won't.\n\n \r\n\r\nParasites have to live on degenerative cells.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou have degenerative cells or your friend and that'll be moving.\n\n \r\n\r\nThose degenerate cells quick.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo this many times, if you have a parasite, the parasite can eat.\n\n \r\n\r\n100 times its weight.\n\n \r\n\r\nIn about 10 hours, 100 times its weight.\n\n Could you imagine eating a.\n\n \r\n\r\n100 times your own waiting?\n\n \r\n\r\n10 hours.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo no.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt will take that math and reduce it to about 110th that a mass in discarded inspired products like we made £7.\n\n00 of food in the day.\n\n Then the next day we drop it out in one.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou will have to have to a whole town turd.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that's what parasites do.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd bacteria do they reduce the contamination.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it's easier.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo handle it, when you have a virus.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's not alive.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat does not eat, it just disassembles things.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's a solvent so you have all this waste product that gets everywhere.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why it's preferable to have bacteria and parasites.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo help you, but we are so contaminated with pollution, the pollution, the pollution in the salesman, that parasites and bacteria eat it, they are killed, they're poisoned, so you can't hold onto the bacteria and parasites.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo help you.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why the body and you get depressed.\n\n \r\n\r\nMost depression is because your body has to rely on solvents with high toxicity that permeates the tissues.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's why when people who have chronic \r\n\r\nPsychological problems and depression.\n\n Once the to high need within 1020 minutes, they're happy.\n\n \r\n\r\nBecause all of a sudden you're giving the body some bacteria to help you do the work, the detoxification.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd it relieves the body of.\n\n \r\n\r\nA lot of work.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo those are very good helpers so.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou want parasites and you want bacteria.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (41) Polio Still Exists \n \nSo every disease that we hear about them\n\n \r\n\r\nIsn't really doesn't really disease really is toxicity.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs that right?\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's it?\n\n \r\n\r\nToxicity accumulates and starts degenerating yourselves.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe only smallpox cold flus, or just different bacteria that.\n\n \r\n\r\nSupposed to get the.\n\n \r\n\r\nSame sound.\n\n \r\n\r\nExist today, but they don't call it polio, they just name it something else to make you believe that they've got.\n\n \r\n\r\nAll right, what do we call it now.\n\n \r\n\r\nSecond, well down or calling that CJD, which is mad humans?\n\n \r\n\r\nIs it.\n\n \r\n\r\nDegeneration of the nervous system?\n\n \r\n\r\nSecond one virus that you.\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't hear a lot of people talk.\n\n \r\n\r\nAbout but it's in Africa, the Ebola virus, and that's pretty.\n\n \r\n\r\nI mean, it's supposed to be like.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that from what I understand that was man made.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can get it, it's.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight, and it was all injected.\n\n \r\n\r\nInjected in with vaccines the same way they each was injected.\n\n \r\n\r\nOh good.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen they were when.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey were when they?\n\n \r\n\r\nIn the smallpox vaccine.\n\n \r\n\r\nWere when they were.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, testing was.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but they were injecting it from what I'm seeing in the EU bar I bacteria was injected with hepatitis.\n\n \r\n\r\nA class.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (42) Pork Red Meat \n \nWhat word is\n\n \r\n\r\nPork is considered red meat?\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (43) Pyruvate Will Give You Energy From Meat Alone \n \nLike if you put too\n\n \r\n\r\nMuch like green, what do you call.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt garnish with your meat is that?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt will also do the same thing preventing.\n\n \r\n\r\nMe from digesting food.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd the same.\n\n \r\n\r\nNo, avocado is a fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot a hierarchal in food.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's a neutral most most of your fats are.\n\n \r\n\r\nNeutral, in fact, all of your fats.\n\n \r\n\r\nAre pretty neutral.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo so.\n\n \r\n\r\nBasically, if you if you need a pyruvate.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt will give you energy right.\n\n \r\n\r\nEven though it's?\n\n \r\n\r\nNot rebuilding itself.\n\n \r\n\r\nOh yeah.\n\n \r\n\r\nGive you lots.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf them, yeah.\n\n \r\n\r\nUnless you're completely skinny person and don't have any.\n\n \r\n\r\nFat to burn.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, so.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen the pyruvate is going to burn quickly, and you're going to have will be like sugar.\n\n You have a quick high energy for maybe 1/2 an hour, 45 minutes, and then you won't have any energy.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo if I.\n\n \r\n\r\nJust eat red meat with nothing with.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt that's going.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo be approving.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I got the fire with.\n\n \r\n\r\nAny food, no or cream or combination.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt to make it really rebuilt.\n\n \r\n\r\nAll right.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot a little bit of time, but we?\n\n \r\n\r\nMight add to like you know, civici or something like that.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's like.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, the little herbs is I can.\n\n \r\n\r\nLike I said in the recipe, 2 tablespoons of herbs.\n\n \r\n\r\nWith a meat meal is is not enough to cause a problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it is OK.\n\n \r\n\r\nOr else

\r\n\r\nOf radiation, so if I'm using it, I keep it away from me.\n\n \r\n\r\nOr if I happen.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo be you.\n\n \r\n\r\nKnow even a cordless phone.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's the same way.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I have a headset with Mic Lola's phone and I will have this, you know near a thick layer like my pants I have it clipped onto my belt if I have to walk around and do things while I'm.\n\n \r\n\r\nTalking on the phone.\n\n \r\n\r\nOtherwise, it sits on the desk or somewhere else or in the couch.\n\n \r\n\r\nWherever I'm sitting you will not be against my body.\n\n \r\n\r\nWere you successful.\n\n \r\n\r\nIn getting the airport people to let?\n\n \r\n\r\nThem put on without extra English, I know.\n\n \r\n\r\nWe weren't being.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (48) Vegetable Juice Sugar \n \nQuestion have a\n\n \r\n\r\nQuestion yes, regarding that Jesus, don't we have?\n\n \r\n\r\nA lot of sugar?\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd would that.\n\n \r\n\r\nCause any problem to someone that is hypoglycemic?\n\n \r\n\r\nIf it's carrot juice or beet juice, any of the high carb diets, I mean carb vegetables, yes, but celery and parsley those.\n\n \r\n\r\nAre not high in.\n\n \r\n\r\nCarbohydrates so shmurder we don't digest much cellulose.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, the best is to take 3.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd when you're juicing, you're removing most of the cellulose steps in the pulse.\n\n And that's where most of the sugar is.\n\n So you're mainly getting mirror minerals, H2O and enzymes.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight, But then do does this still apply to the sugar.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe sugar content for Hypoglycaemic will?\n\n \r\n\r\nNo, you will not do that unless you're doing you're having.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt cause any reaction.\n\n \r\n\r\nCharacters or.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, so green juices will be.\n\n \r\n\r\nCorrect, then there's no, there's no high carb problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nAny any kind of reviews.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd what is the best amount to think?\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's you want to cover all that's in the recipe book?\n\n \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's OK.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's all broken down in the rest of you.\n\n \r\n\r\nEverything you want to.\n\n \r\n\r\nKnow about it.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou mentioned.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (49) Viruses \n \n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, going way back when they're talking about viruses and viruses are made by the body of solvents\n\n \r\nThe CDC talks about when they sort of give a weather forecast for upcoming viruses that are these new plague like viruses.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd they're all psychic aren't they.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nRight, well, I mean?\n\n \r\nWhat's going on.\n\n \r\nIs it just?\n\n\r\nApprox?\n\n so they can sell their winter time flew?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAbsolutely, yeah.\n\n \r\nYou know, the CDC wouldn't exist if that people didn't have fear of disease.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd oh, there's no question there that they're playing the fear card.\n\n**[Attendee #2]**\n\r\nCan I answer that question too.\n\n \r\nI have two medical centers now and I'll tell you, they send us things, so I tell you, it's a joke and it's kind of funny that people are like why do you own a Medical Center?\n\n \r\nWe do alternative things, but they still send you things and I laugh at them because they'll predict too far in advance and I know that part of this is that they're the cause of some of it absolutely, more than people want to want to say?\n\n \r\nBut the rest of it's just a joke people come in and people ask me by getting flu shots.\n\n\r\nI'm so adamant against vaccinations it's not even funny, so we don't we don't do vaccinations, we will not touch that, but it is actually accurate.\n\n They will back Step to you from the CDC.\n\n \r\nThey will fax us from the National Institutes of Health and tell us every position in the country becuase they have database.\n\n \r\nIf you have a DEA license, you were in a database, so they will send it to you and they were located there.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd all your high executives in the FDA all go from the executive offices of FDA to a high paying job in a Pharmaceutical industry.\n\n \r\nAnd vice versa same way and CDC is the same.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nHow do they create pandemics if viruses are created by the body and not spread by either breathing or whatever.\n\n \r\nHow can they create the pandemic.\n\n \r\nI think that?\n\n \r\nThe CDC and pharmaceutical houses.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nOh, they do because they're dealing in drugs, which cause the body to breakdown tissue and to need a virus or bacteria or a parasite.\n\n**[Attendee #3],[Aajonus]**\n\r\nPlus the water is loaded and the chemtrails, the air, I mean there's already chemicals everywhere, it's just they-\r\n\n\r\nWe're always going to have detoxification.\n\n \r\nGonna get colds,flus and detoxification.\n\n, period.\n\n**[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nI didn't have one this year.\n\n \r\nI don't know why.\n\n.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Attendee #3]**\n\r\nSorry to hear that *crowd laughs hysterically*\r\n\n\r\nSo, you're on a 100% raw diet, you don't need to worry about smallpox, virus, terrorist scares or anything like that.\n\n\r\n?\n \n \n \n### (50) What Happened Over 105 Degrees In Bath & Sweat Lodges Toxic \n \n \r\n\r\n\r\nExternal body temperatures in there 105 is the magic number\n\n What happens if you get into a bath that's 706 or.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou'll start destroying the enzymes and vitamins in your skin and what's in connective tissue?\n\n \r\n\r\nSome say yes?\n\n \r\n\r\nAny kind of.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey have to build 105 degree?\n\n \r\n\r\nNo tab starts right immediately above that, so you like.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut whatever, like.\n\n \r\n\r\nIndian Sweat lodge is.\n\n \r\n\r\nVery toxic, very toxic, very text and did you read the sweat lodge as I was at.\n\n \r\n\r\nHot Springs \r\n\r\nLet's start?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou'd find out that the Indians, when they put us in sweat lodges, they they lie down.\n\n \r\n\r\nBack it's so dark you can't tell where they are, but they're lying down.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nExternal body temperatures, I know 105 is the magic number.\n\n What happens if you get into a bath that's 106 or.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Kathy]**\n\r\nYou'll start destroying the enzymes and vitamins in your skin and your connective tissue\r\n\n\r\nWhat's that?\n\n Sauna bath?\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAny kind of bath that's above 105 degrees?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOkay, so it's right immediately above that, so you like.\n\n \r\nBut whatever, like Indian Sweat lodges or.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nVery toxic, very toxic, very toxic?\n\n And if you were at the sweat lodge as I was at you'd find out that the Indians, when they put us in sweat lodges, they they lie down and back.\n\n\r\nIt's so dark you can't tell where they are, but they're lying down.\n\n \r\nThere's 12 inches of complete ground air.\n\n \r\nAnd when I found them lying back, they weren't exposed to all those toxins and chemicals they were on the ground breathing the fresh air.\n\n \r\nSo, when I got in weat lodges after that I did that too.\n\n \r\nSo, only the people who were ignorant and that was one other way to get the white man.\n\n**[Attendees],[Aajonus]**\n\r\n*laughs*\r\n\n\r\nGet him in the sweat lodge with you and poison him.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd he's getting poisoned because it's too hot.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, you got monoxide, burning?\n\n Carbon monoxides.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nFrom the water on the rock.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou got other things on the rocks that are burning?\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nOhhhh.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYou know you've got dirt.\n\n \r\nYou've got grass, you've got leaves, anything that they put to make the hot rocks hot or on the rocks they're burning on the rock.\n\n**[Kathy]**\n\r\nWith fire.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nCorrect?\n\n\r\nSo all that's smoke in there.\n\n \r\nIs not just steam.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nYeah, like when they sprinkle the sage and cedar or whatever.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nRight there you go.\n\n \r\nYou're burning monoxides\r\nAne the oxides are poison.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nWhat about people who live in a climate that often times will be 110 or 115 without air conditioning for awhile.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, there's there's all?\n\n \r\nThere's that space, it's not.\n\n \r\nLike water where you've got.\n\n \r\nYour body sets out a cooling mechanism and you're- you'll have more fluids.\n\n \r\nThe blood will be thinner and you'll be cooling yourself.\n\n \r\nYou know you have a cooling system, but when you're under hot water and it's that close to the skin, there's no buffer zone.\n\n \r\nEspecially if you're moving around.\n\n Let's say you stay completely still, you might have 1/4 of an inch, half of an inch buffering zone, but that's not enough.\n\n Normally we have about 3 inch buffering zone.\n\n \r\nWith the air, but with fluids no.\n\n \r\nLouis, yes.\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nWhat would you suggest is a good amount of exercise for me to do.\n\n \r\nOr would you need to check the worry circles in my eyes?\n\n**[Aajonus],[Louis]**\n\r\nI need to check the worry circles\r\n\n\r\nI see OK?\n\n \r\nBut you do have worry circles.\n\n \r\nAnd you do need to exercise.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nI remember, yeah, we we had a talking, you recommended it.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (51) What To Eat With Coconut Cream \n \nYes, about coconut cream, so we need to be\n\n \r\n\r\nCareful what we're eating it with and what we're.\n\n \r\n\r\nNot eating it.\n\n \r\n\r\nWith and put there and interested in.\n\n \r\n\r\nHigh meats and eggs.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I would need it.\n\n \r\n\r\nWith I mean.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt might interfere with.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe body makes a lot of solvents with the types of cholesterol types of fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat are in coconut cream.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it could interfere with the bacterial growth.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs is passing through anyway.\n\n \r\n\r\nCoconut cream is your best solvent.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you take one of those canning jar lids that are metal and not enameled, and you put the coconut cream on it 20 minutes to an hour.\n\n \r\n\r\nLater it will be black.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo quickly it pulls up, metal, dissolves compounds in the body, so it is the best fat to use to detoxify of anything.\n\n \r\n\r\nWho help people in system.\n\n \r\n\r\nEating it with pineapple increases that the solvent reaction?\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, anybody use that.\n\n \r\n\r\nI suggest that they also use, you know, raw cream and butter with with the coconut cream and the?\n\n \r\n\r\nThe pineapple so that you have enough of the good fats to arrest.\n\n \r\n\r\nI don't know why I usually take my shoes off immediately.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen I go into the house.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's wonderful.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo you need some other fats to bind with those poisons once they're pulled out of the system.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe coconut won't necessarily do it.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo the animal fats are better for arresting poison.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo, so you should never or is it bad.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo have just a super two of permanent grain and?\n\n \r\n\r\nThen eat your meat and then.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou have to have other fats afterwards.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight.\n\n \r\n\r\nShould always have animal fats with your meat, not just coconut cream?\n\n \r\n\r\nLike I say coconut cream is mainly the solve.\n\n \r\n\r\nOnly when it gets to the skin and the hair.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs at the Lube.\n\n \r\n\r\nSometimes in the joints a little bit.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then to the eggs.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs there any problem having it at the same time you're.\n\n \r\n\r\nHaving egg, it'll just eggs have a tendency to be a detox?\n\n \r\n\r\nA fire when it's mixed with coconut cream or fruit.\n\n \r\n\r\nAIDS can be.\n\n \r\n\r\nUsed if they're even alone.\n\n \r\n\r\nEggs can usually bind with poisons that are in the blood and in the system.\n\n \r\n\r\nNeurological system.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey can also help reconstitute cells.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey don't help cellular division reproduction, but they do help restructure.\n\n \r\n\r\nGive new protein, fats, and cells that are.\n\n \r\n\r\nAlready alive.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut when egg is mixed with any kind of fruit or coconut cream, it will become.\n\n \r\n\r\nMore of a solvent.\n\n \r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n .\n \n \n \n### (52) When To Drink Cabbage Juice & Dont Mix With Celery \n \nBut you haven't want to cook diet eating\n\n \r\n\r\nI'm still in the second.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat's less severe.\n\n \r\n\r\nWith the green cabbage juice.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs it important to drink it first thing in the morning.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt should be either morning or night?\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd can you drink it with your regular dreams.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you do, you need to wait 10?\n\n \r\n\r\n15 minutes before you do.\n\n \r\n\r\nWe'd rather.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut you shouldn't mix them.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n### (53) Why They Put Mercury In Vaccines \n \nSee, the problem is that they put the time aerosol in the vaccines because vaccines\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know, like which.\n\n \r\n\r\nHappened to to pass through every time you vaccinate?\n\n \r\n\r\nAn animal they went into.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd anaphylaxis, shock and died.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that same thing will happen to humans, but for some reason when they use the thimerosal in it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt causes such a reaction in the body that the body won't die.\n\n \r\n\r\nDon't go into that kind.\n\n \r\n\r\nOf shock as often.\n\n \r\n\r\nSuch as what reactions.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe the type of anaphylaxis the?\n\n \r\n\r\nAllergy to the to the.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe to the disease that they're giving you when they inject you with the disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's such that it's not.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight it it stops the the high rate of fatalities.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe court martialing \r\n\r\nThat they don't.\n\n \r\n\r\nDo to armed forces.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen right they stopped that if they don't.\n\n \r\n\r\nTake the vaccine.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n \r\n\r\nSecond, yeah.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight.\n\n \r\n\r\nPosting them do?\n\n \r\n\r\nBernardes settings.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo on the computer.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat breaks down.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, but that's ******** \r\n\r\nIf you if you go to those.\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you hear the inductees and the volunteers who went to the military, they still threaten.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey don't courtmartial you, but they.\n\n \r\n\r\nSure, make your life hell.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt sounds like what you're saying is.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen they put.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe heavy metal in the vaccination that.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's almost like.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, it it kind of inhibits the actual disease enough.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo that it doesn't make that huge reaction.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, I think what happens is when you get a flush of.\n\n \r\n\r\nDisease in the blood.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe body reacts dramatically because normally a disease will be a developmental reaction within the system and the body has a reaction to that every time.\n\n \r\n\r\nEvery single vaccine for something like 9 years.\n\n \r\n\r\nEvery animal that Pasteur injected with the disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nDied not one survived.\n\n \r\n\r\nThen they started using formaldehyde with with the disease and that and then they started using thimerosol in the 1920s.\n\n Liquid mercury.\n\n What happened was it looks like the body had to deal with the poison instead of the disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo the bodies it was so yes, so involved with dealing with the high poison that the disease didn't get registered.\n\n \r\n\r\nLet's check.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then the body didn't go into anaphylactic shock as often, but there are people who go in there in a flex it shot and died from vaccines.\n\n \r\n\r\nEven with the thimerosal.\n\n \r\n\r\nI have a question on this mad.\n\n \r\n\r\nCow disease because I.\n\n \r\n\r\nKnow that it's like most viruses.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that kids that are.\n\n \r\n\r\nOut there on for billions of years.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs long as planets been here, but since that's a.\n\n \r\n\r\nMore recent thing, it's essentially been created by.\n\n \r\n\r\nMan correct because OK.\n\n \r\n\r\nI want to know.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut it has the exact same symptoms of foot and mouth, which is basically a flu.\n\n \r\n\r\nA cow flu.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, so when like you hear about.\n\n \r\n\r\nEurope when they you.\n\n \r\n\r\nKnow burned all the millions of cows.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat they had over.\n\n \r\n\r\nThere, and they apparently.\n\n \r\n\r\nCouldn't bury them in the soil.\n\n \r\n\r\nThey've actually stored them in old like World War Two plane.\n\n \r\n\r\nHangars and just like 'cause you.\n\n \r\n\r\nCan't it's so toxic that?\n\n \r\n\r\nCan't even touch.\n\n \r\n\r\nAny of it, and apparently if they do like a, what do you call it like.\n\n \r\n\r\nAn autopsy on someone who's had bring and mad cow?\n\n \r\n\r\nThey have to?\n\n \r\n\r\nLiterally throw away everything.\n\n \r\n\r\n'cause there's no way.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo sterilize it to sterilize.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnything, is that true.\n\n I?\n\n \r\n\r\nMean do you?\n\n \r\n\r\nJust remember, when something is arrived, sterilization doesn't matter?\n\n \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\nI mean that matters.\n\n \r\n\r\nSterilizing is there to destroy bacteria and virus and things that are alive.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut when you have metal contamination and poison, you can sterilize all you want to.\n\n You can sterilize strychnine's or you're blue in the face.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can heat it.\n\n \r\n\r\nUp to.\n\n \r\n\r\n20 thirty 200 degrees and it won't disturb it.\n\n You'll still die.\n\n It poisoning that strychnine poisoning they're just throwing it off on something unnatural disease.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhen it's really the chemical poisoning of those animals, which is the problem, and there's so many poisons, there's so many alkaloids and just.\n\n \r\n\r\nStrychnine is an alcohol.\n\n \r\n\r\nAll of those poisons are heavy alkaloids, just different chemical structures of alkaloids.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat makes them those poisons.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo when you have all of this in those animals.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou can't bury it 'cause it'll damage the soil.\n\n \r\n\r\nGet into game.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe groundwater be right, right.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs the groundwater will get into the system?\n\n \r\n\r\nSo I guess though my question is.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo you do.\n\n \r\n\r\nBelieve that this particular virus is extremely toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd that it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs but it's.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe virus is not tired.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat it's just.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut the poisoning of the body is toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, what I'm saying is like the ashes that.\n\n \r\n\r\nAre leftover from.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe cows, I mean you agree.\n\n \r\n\r\nThat they should be.\n\n \r\n\r\nSo it's not the virus that's the problem, it's the poison that that's the problem.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK.\n\n \r\n\r\nBut you still.\n\n \r\n\r\nSay that they should just be completely left separate.\n\n \r\n\r\nFor anyone can come into contact with.\n\n \r\n\r\nOh absolutely.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, that's me.\n\n \r\n\r\n'cause if it.\n\n \r\n\r\nIs indeed that?\n\n \r\n\r\nWhich is what you're agreeing to that I mean that's.\n\n \r\n\r\nPretty serious because it's like what I mean.\n\n \r\n\r\nYeah, you can burn them and you can but.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhat the hell do you do with them.\n\n \r\n\r\nI mean, you know?\n\n \r\n\r\nThere's like any toxic waste that's highly toxic.\n\n \r\n\r\nYou have to control the contamination.\n\n \r\n\r\nRight.\n\n \r\n\r\n ?\n \n \n \n### (54) Worrisome Mind \n \n**[Louis]**\n\r\nWell my question\n\n \r\nI noticeb I let mental problems get to me.\n\n \r\nIs there anything you can suggest as far as diet or other things is too for the worries of mind.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nYeah, stand up comedy?\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nOh, we've discussed that, right.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIt's it's just a different focus, you know.\n\n t's a different focus to train yourself and when you were doing standup comedy?\n\n \r\nLouis, you know, he was the fella I wrote about in the book that took a long time to say a simple sentence, you know.\n\n \r\nDidn't have any friends 'cause he just-\r\nNobody had the patience.\n\n \r\nAnd it came to the point where he was live enough, but still too serious.\n\n \r\nSo I told him take a stand up comedy routine.\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nHa ha.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nAnd it worked, he was very good.\n\n \r\nAnd the people laughing, but when you were doing that you were more fun, and then when you get away from it you get back into that heavy mentality again.\n\n \r\nCream is also very helpful to relax the nervous system.\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nI love cream, yes.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nSo if you're wired, you know, bent out of shape, upset.\n\n Cream is the thing to take.\n\n Less butter, more cream.\n\n**[Louis]**\n\r\nAlright.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n \r\nNut paste too.\n\n**[Aajonus],[Louis]**\n\r\nYeah, nut butter if you're-\r\n\n\r\nThose two things, cream and nut butter?\n\n I love to consume them.\n\n\r\n.\n \n \n \n### (55) Worry Circles & Exercise \n \nWell, in in the iris\n\n \r\n\r\nIf you see bands that go around.\n\n \r\n\r\nThe I you know, if you see the muscle muscles in the iris is they have breaks in it little spaced areas where it looks like there are arches, parts or complete circles.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nWell, in in the iris.\n\n \r\nIf you see bands that go around the eye, you know, if you see the muscles in the iris, if they have breaks in it, a little spaced areas where it looks like there are arches, or complete circles.\n\n \r\nI call those worry circles most iridologists call them stress rings.\n\n \r\nI don't like calling stress rings because most people think they have no power over stress.\n\n \r\nBut what they mean is you produce a lot of hormones.\n\n \r\nThe more worry circles, the more hormones you produce.\n\n \r\nThe more physically oriented you are as a birthright.\n\n \r\nThat's genetically, they don't change, they never change.\n\n \r\nSo, athletes usually have from 6 to 10 worry circles.\n\n \r\nSo, they have to exercise 5 to 10 hours a day, minimum.\n\n \r\nPeople who have three worry circles need to exercise about an hour, an hour and a half a day.\n\n \r\nIf you have up to 5-6 worry circles, anywhere from two to three hours a day.\n\n \r\nIf you're fortunate like me, you know if you want to be, you know somebody who's a writer and stuff like that, then no worry circles is preferable, which is what I have, but if you have worry circles, you do need to exercise.\n\n If you have only one worry circle, about half an hour to 45 minutes a day.\n\n \r\nSo if you can look into your eyes and you can see that they can tell and you can count them.\n\n \r\nBut when people come to me for reading, I tell them if they need exercise and how much time they need exercise.\n\n**[Attendee]**\n\r\nAnd are there particular kinds of exercise that you would recommend or just anything from walking, biking to yoga.\n\n**[Aajonus]**\n\r\nIf the worry circles are complete circles, they need to do high intesitve things like aerobics dance.\n\n \r\nHeavy sport, you know tenniss, basketball, swimming.\n\n\r\n if your circles break up.\n\n \r\nYou knowou can jog a block and then walk a block.\n\n \r\nYou don't need to do that intense constant.\n\n \r\n.\n \n \n \n### (56) You Can Mix Fruit With White Meat \n \nBut I mean with, you know, with your white\n\n \r\n\r\nMeats you can.\n\n \r\n\r\nMix any fruit.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt's OK as long as it's fabulous.\n\n \r\n\r\nHave a fruit.\n\n \r\n\r\nChicken, right.\n\n \r\n\r\nAny any in the?\n\n \r\n\r\nBook I am sauce in there, I think is a Peach sauce for for fish?\n\n \r\n\r\nYou know you can have any kind of.\n\n \r\n\r\nFruit with white meat.\n\n \r\n\r\nAs long as it's with fat.\n\n \r\n\r\nAdditionally, not just the fruit with the with the fish.\n\n \r\n\r\nStill kind of want.\n\n \r\n\r\nTo watch out for the alkalinizing effects of the group.\n\n \r\n\r\nWell, your fish and chicken are pretty alkalinizing.\n\n \r\n\r\nRed meats are very heavily acid.\n\n \r\n\r\nOK, what about the cellulose.\n\n \r\n\r\nIt it depends on how much you eat?\n\n \r\n\r\nRight.\n\n \r\n\r\nWhite meat is all fowl and all seafood fish?\n\n \r\n\r\nAnd then you.\n\n \r\n\r\n .\n \n \n \n"
